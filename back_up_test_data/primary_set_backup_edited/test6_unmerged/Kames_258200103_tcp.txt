"not with respect to itself, but with respect to the boldness of the person who inflicts it: and wine is said to be jovial, as inspiring mirth and jollity. Thus the attributes of one subject, are extended to another with which it is connected; and such expression must be considered as a figure, because it deviates from ordinary language."
"               How are we to account for this figure, for we see it lies in the thought, and to what principle shall we refer it? Have poets a privilege to alter the nature of things, and at pleasure to bestow attributes upon sub-jects to which these attributes do not be-long? It is an evident truth, which we have had often occasion to inculcate, that the mind, in idea, passeth easily and sweet-ly along a train of connected objects; and, where the objects are intimately connected, that it is disposed to carry along the good or bad properties of one to another; espe-cially where it is in any degree inflamed with these propertiesSee  2. part 1.  4.. From this princi-ple is derived the figure under consideration."
"Language, invented for the communication of thought, would be imperfect, if it were not expressive even of the slighter propen-sities and more delicate feelings. But lan-guage cannot remain so imperfect, among a people who have received any polish; be-cause language is regulated by internal feel  and is gradually so improved as to ex-press whatever passes in the mind. Thus, for example, a sword in the hand of a coward, is, in poetical diction, termed a coward sword: the expression is significative of an internal operation; for the mind, in passing from the agent to its instrument, is disposed to extend to the latter the proper-ties of the former. Governed by the same principle, we say listening fear, by extend the attribute listening of the man who listens, to the passion with which he is mo-ved. In the expression, bold deed, or au-dax facinus, we extend to the effect, what properly belongs to the cause. But not to waste time by making a commentary upon every expression of this kind, the best way to give a complete view of the subject, is to"

"                Metaphor and Allegory."
"               A Metaphor differs from a simile, in form only, not in substance. In a si-mile the two different subjects are kept dis-tinct in the expression, as well as in the thought: in a metaphor, the two sub-jects are kept distinct in thought only, not in expression. A hero resembles a lion, and upon that resemblance many similes have been made by Homer and other poets. But instead of resembling a lion, let us take the aid of the imagination, and feign or fi-gure the hero to be a lion. By this varia the simile is converted into a metaphor; which is carried on by describing all the qualities of a lion that resemble those of the hero. The fundamental pleasure here, that of resemblance, belongs to thought as distin-guished from expression. There is an addition-al pleasure which arises from the expression."
"The poet, by figuring his hero to be a lion, goes on to describe the lion in appearance, but in reality the hero; and his description is peculiarly beautiful, by expressing the vir-tues and qualities of the hero in new terms, which, properly speaking, belong not to him, but to a different being. This will better be understood by examples. A family connected with a common pa-rent, resembles a tree, the trunk and branches of which are connected with a common root. But let us suppose, that a family is figured not barely to be like a tree, but to be a tree; and then the simile will be converted into a metaphor, in the following manner."

"               I am aware that the term metaphor has been used in a more extensive sense than I give it; but I thought it of consequence, in matters of some intricacy, to separate things that differ from each other, and to confine words within their most proper sense. An allegory differs from a metaphor; and what I would chuse to call a figure of speech, dif-fers from both. I shall proceed to explain these differences. A metaphor is defined a-bove to be an operation of the imagination, figuring one thing to be another. An al-legory requires no operation of the imagina  nor is one thing figured to be another: it consists in chusing a subject having pro-perties or circumstances resembling those of"
"the principal subject; and the former is scribed in such a manner as to represent the latter. The subject thus represented is kept out of view; we are left to disco-ver it by reflection; and we are pleased with the discovery, because it is our own work. QuintilianL. 8. cap. 6.  2, gives the following instance of an allegory,"
"                     navis, referent in mare te novi"
"                     Fluctus. quid agis? fortiter occupa portum."
"                     Horat.  1. ode 14,"
"                  "
"and explains it elegantly in the following words: Totusque ille Horatii locus, quo navim pro republica, fluctuum tempe-states pro bellis civilibus, portum pro pa-ce atque concordia, dicit."
"               "
"               There cannot be a finer or more correct allegory than the following, in which a vineyard is put for God own people the Jews."
"                     Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. Thou didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the"
"land. The hills were covered with its shadow, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all which pass do pluck her? The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast doth vour it. Return, we beseech thee, God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold and visit this vine, and the vineyard thy right hand hath planted, and the branch thou madest strong for thyself."
"                     Psalm 80."
"                  "
"               "
"               In a word, an allegory is in every respect similar to an hieroglyphical painting, ex-cepting only, that words are used instead of colours. Their effects are precisely the same. A hieroglyphic raises two images in the mind; one seen, which represents one not seen. An allegory does the same. The representative subject is described; and it is by resemblance that we are enabled to ap-ply the description to the subject represent "
"               In a figure of speech, neither is there any fiction of the imagination em-ployed, nor a representative subject introdu-ced. A figure of speech, as implyed from"
"its name, regards the expression only, not the thought; and it may be defined, the employing a word in a sense different from what is proper to it. Thus youth or the beginning of life, is expressed figuratively by morning of life. Morning is the begin-ning of the day; and it is transferred sweet-ly and easily to signify the beginning of any other series, life especially, the progress of which is reckoned by days."
"               Figures of speech are reserved for a sepa-rate section; but a metaphor and allegory are so much connected, that it is necessary to handle them together: the rules for dis-tinguishing the good from the bad, are common to both. We shall therefore pro-ceed to these rules, after adding some ex-amples to illustrate the nature of an allego-ry. Horace speaking of his love to Pyrrha, which was now extinguished, expresses himself thus."

"The rules that govern metaphors and al-legories, are of two kinds: those of the first kind concern the construction of a meta-phor or allegory, and ascertain what are perfect and what are faulty: those of the other kind concern the propriety or impro-priety of introduction, in what circumstances these figures may be admitted, and in what circumstances they are out of place. I be-gin with rules of the first kind; some of which coincide with those already given with respect to similes; some are peculiar to metaphors and allegories."
"               And in the first place, it has been obser-ved, that a simile cannot be agreeable where the resemblance is either too strong or too faint. This holds equally in a metaphor and allegory; and the reason is the same in all. In the following instances, the resem-blance is too faint to be agreeable."

"                   The following metaphor is strained be-yond all endurance. Timur-bec, known to us by the name of Tamarlane the Great, writes to Bajazet Emperor of the Ottomans in the following terms."
"                     Where is the monarch who dares resist us? where is the potentate who doth not glory in being num-bered among our attendants? As for thee, descend from a Turcoman sailor, since the vessel of thy unbounded ambition hath been wrecked in the gulf of they self-love, it would be proper, that thou shouldst take in the sails of they temerity, and cast the anchor of repentance in the port of sincerity and justice, which is the port of safety; lest the tempest of our vengeance make thee perish in the sea of the punishment thou deservest."
"                   Such strained figures, it is observable, are"
"not unfrequent in the first dawn of refine-ment. The mind in a new enjoyment knows no bounds, and is generally carried to excess, till experience discover the just medium."
"               Secondly, whatever resemblance subjects may have, it is wrong to put one for ano-ther if they bear no mutual proportion. Where a very high and a very low subject are compared, the simile takes on an air of burlesk; and the same will be the effect, where the one is imagined to be the other, as in a metaphor, or made to represent the other, as in an allegory."
"               Thirdly, these figures, a metaphor in particular, ought not to be extended to a great length, nor be crowded with many minute circumstances; for in that case it is scarcely possible to avoid obscurity. It is difficult, during any course of time, to sup-port a lively image of one thing being ano-ther. A metaphor drawn out to any length, instead of illustrating or enlivening the principal subject, becomes disagreeable by overstraining the mind. Cowley is ex-tremely"
"licentious in this way. Take the following instance:"
"                     Great, and wise conqu'ror, who where er"
"                     Thou com'st, dost fortify, and settle there!"
"                     Who canst defend as well as get;"
"                     And never hadst one quarter beat up yet;"
"                     Now thou art in, thou ne'er will part"
"                     With one inch of my vanquished heart;"
"                     For since thou took'st it by assault from me,"
"                      it is garrisoned so strong with thoughts of thee"
"                     It fears no beauteous enemy."
"                  "
"For the same reason, however agreeable at first long allegories may be by their novelty, they never afford any lasting pleasure: wit-ness the Fairy Queen, which with great power of expression, variety of images, and melody of versification, is scarce ever read a second time."
"               In the fourth place, the comparison car-ried on in a simile, being in a metaphor sunk, and the principal subject being ima-gined that very thing which it only resem-bles, an opportunity is furnished to describe it in terms taken strictly or literally with re-spect to its imagined nature. This suggests"
"The badges of his grief and patience;"
"                     That had not God, for some strong purpose, steeled"

"another rule, That in constructing a meta-phor, the writer ought to confine himself to the simplest expressions, and make use of such words only as are applicable literally to the imagined nature of his subject. Fi-gurative words ought carefully to be avoid  for such complicated images, instead of setting the principal subject in a strong light, involve it in a cloud; and it is well if the reader, without rejecting by the lump, endeavour patiently to gather the plain meaning, regardless of the figures:"

"Let us analize this expression. That a fe-ver may be imagined a flame, I admit; though more than one step is necessary to come at the resemblance. A fever, by heating the body, resembles fire; and it is no stretch to imagine a fever to be a fire."
"Again, by a figure of speech, flame may be put for fire, because they are commonly conjoined; and therefore a fever may also be imagined a flame. But now admitting a fever to be a flame, its effects ought to be explained in words that agree literally to a flame. This rule is not observed here; for a flame drinks figuratively only, not properly. King Henry to his son Prince Henry:"

"In the sixth place, It is unpleasant to join different metaphors in the same period, even where they are preserved distinct.

"In the last place, It is still worse to jum-ble together metaphorical and natural ex-pression, or to construct a period so as that it must be understood partly metaphorically partly literally. The imagination cannot follow with sufficient ease changes so sudden and unprepared.

"Lord Halifax, speaking of the ancient fa-bulists: They (says he) wrote in signs and spoke in parables: all their fables carry a double meaning: the story is one and entire; the characters the same throughout; not broken or changed, and always conformable to the nature of the creature they introduce. They never tell you, that the dog which snapped at a shadow, lost his troop of horse; that would be unintelligible. This is his (Dry-den  new way of telling a story, and confounding the moral and the fable to-gether. After instancing from the hind and panther, he goes on thus: What relation has the hind to our Sa-viour? or what notion have we of a

panther bible? If you say he means the church, how does the church feed on lawns, or range in the forest? Let it be always a church or always a cloven-footed beast, for we cannot bear his shifting the scene every line."

"               A few words more upon allegory. No-thing gives greater pleasure than this figure, when the representative subject bears a strong analogy, in all its circumstances, to that which is represented. But the choice is seldom so lucky; the resemblance of the representative subject to the principal, be generally so faint and obscure, as to puzzle and not please. An allegory is still more difficult in painting than in poetry. The former can show no resemblance but what appears to the eye: the latter hath many other resources for showing the re-semblance. With respect to what the Abbé du BosReflexions sur Poesie, &amp   1.  24. terms mixt allegorical composi-tions, these may do in poetry, because in writing the allegory can easily be distin-guished from the historical part: no person"
"mistakes Virgil Fame for a real being. But such a mixture in a picture is intolerable; because in a picture the objects must ap-pear all of the same kind, wholly real or wholly emblematical. The history of Mary Medicis, in the palace of Luxen-bourg, painted by Rubens, is in a vicious taste, by a perpetual jumble of real and al-legorical personages, which produce a dis-cordance of parts and an obscurity upon the whole: witness in particular, the tablature re-presenting the arrival of Mary Medicis at Marseilles: mixt with the real personages, the Nereids and Tritons appear sounding their shells. Such a mixture of fiction and reality in the same group, is strangely ab-surd. The picture of Alexander and Roxana, described by Lucian, is gay and fanciful: but it suffers by the allegorical figures. It is not in the wit of man to in-vent an allegorical representation deviating farther from any appearance of resemblance, than one exhibited by Lewis XIV. anno 1664; in which an overgrown chariot, in-tended to represent that of the sun, is"

This inquiry is not altogether superseded by what is said upon the same subject in the chapter of comparisons; because, upon trial, it will be found, that a short metaphor or allegory may be proper, where a simile, drawn out to a greater length, and in its nature more solemn, would scarce be relished.

And, in the first place, a metaphor, as well as a simile, are exclu-ded from common conversation, and from the description of ordinary incidents."

"                 Figure of Speech."
"               IN the section immediately foregoing, a figure of speech is defined, The em-ploying

a word in a sense different from what is proper to it; and the new or uncommon sense of the word is termed the figurative sense. The figurative sense must have a relation to that which is proper; and the more intimate the relation is, the figure is the more happy. How ornamental this figure is to language, will not be readily i-magined by any one who hath not given peculiar attention. I shall endeavour to dis-play its capital beauties and advantages. In the first place, a word used figuratively, to-gether with its new sense, suggests what it commonly bears: and thus it has the effect to present two objects; one signified by the figurative sense, which may be termed the principal object; and one signified by the proper sense, which may be termed accesso-ry. The principal makes a part of the thought; the accessory is merely ornamen-tal. In this respect, a figure of speech is precisely similar to concordant sounds in music, which, without contributing to the melody, make it harmonious. I explain myself by examples. Youth, by a figure of speech, is termed the morning of life. This"
"expression signifies youth, the principal ob-ject, which enters into the thought: but it suggests, at the same time, the proper sense of morning; and this accessory object being in itself beautiful and connected by resemblance to the principal object, is not a little ornamental. I give another exam-ple, of a different kind, where an attribute is expressed figuratively, Imperious ocean. Together with the figurative meaning of the epithet imperious, there is suggested its proper meaning, viz. the stern authority of a despotic prince. Upon this figurative power of words, Vida descants with great elegance:"
"                     Nonne vides, verbis ut veris saepe relictis"
"                     Accersant simulata, aliundeque nomina porro"
"                     Transportent, aptentque aliis ea rebus; ut ip sae,"
"                     Exuviasque novas, res, insolitosque colores"
"                     Indutae, saepe externi mirentur amictus"
"                     Unde illi, laetaeque aliena luce fruantur,"
"                     Mutatoque habitu, nec jam sua nomina mallent?"
"                     Saepe ideo, cum bella canunt, incendia c"
"                           •"
"                        edas"
"                     Cernere, diluviumque ingens surgentibus undis."
"                     Contrà etiam Martis pugnas imitabitur ignis,"
"                     Cum furit accensis acies Vulcania campis."
"                     "
"                        "
"Nec turbato oritur quondam minor aequore pugna:"
"                     Confligunt animosi Euri certamine vasto"
"                     Inter se, pugnantque adversis molibus undae."
"                     Usque adeo passim sua res insignia laetae"
"                     Permutantque, juvantque vicissim; &amp; mutua sese"
"                     Altera in alterius transformat protinus ora."
"                     Tum specie capti gaudent spectare legentes:"
"                     Nam diversa simul datur è re cernere eadem"
"                     Multarum simulacra animo subeuntia rerum."
"                     Poet.  3.  44."
"                  "
"               "
"               In the next place, this figure possesses a signal power of aggrandising an object, by the following means. Words, which have no original beauty but what arises from their sound, acquire an adventitious beauty from their meaning. A word signifying any thing that is agreeable, becomes by that means agreeable; for the agreeableness of the object is communicated to its nameSee  2. part 1.  4.. This acquired beauty, by the force of cu-stom, adheres to the word even when used figuratively; and the beauty received from the thing it properly signifies, is communi-cated to the thing which it is made to sig-nify"
"figuratively. Consider the foregoing expression Imperious ocean, how much more elevated it is than Stormy ocean."
"               "
"               Thirdly, this figure hath a happy effect in preventing the familiarity of proper names. The familiarity of a proper name, is com-municated to the thing it signifies by means of their intimate connection; and the thing is thereby brought down in our feelingI have often regretted, that a factious spirit of opposition to the reigning family made it necessary in public worship to distinguish the King by his proper name. One will scarce ima-gine, who has not made the trial, how much better it sounds to pray for our Sovereign Lord the King, without any addition.. This bad effect is prevented by using a figu-rative word instead of one that is proper; as, for example, when we express the sky by terming it the blue vault of heaven. For though no work made with hands can com-pare with the sky in magnificence, the ex-pression however is good, by preventing the object from being brought down by the familiarity of its proper name. With respect to the degrading familiarity of pro-per names, Vida has the following passage."
"                     Hinc si dura mihi passus dicendus Ulysses,"
"                     "
"                        "
"As words convey but a faint and obscure notion of great numbers, a poet, to give a high notion of the object he describes with regard to number, does well to compare it to what is familiar and commonly known. Thus HomerBook 2.  111. compares the Grecian army in point of number to a swarm of bees. In another passageBook 2.  551. he compares it to that profusion of leaves and flowers which appear in the spring, or of insects in a summer evening. And Milton,"
"                  —As when the potent rod"
"                  Of Amram son in Egypt evil day"
"                  Waved round the coast, up called a pitchy cloud"
"                  Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind,"
"                  That er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung"
"                  Like night, and darkened all the land of Nile:"
"                  So numberless were those bad angels seen,"
"                  Hovering on wing under the cope of hell,"
"                  'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding fires."
"                  Paradise Lost, book 1."
"               "
"Such comparisons have, by some wri-tersSee Vidae Poetic.  2.  282., been condemned for the lowness of"
"Non illum vero memorabo nomine, sed qui"
"                     Et mores hominum multorum vidit, &amp; urbes,"
"                     Naufragus eversae post saeva incendia Trojae."
"                     Poet.  2.  46."
"                  "
"               "
"               Lastly, by this figure language is enriched and rendered more copious. In that re-spect, were there no other, a figure of speech is a happy invention. This property is finely touched by Vida:"
"                     Quinetiam agricolas ea fandi nota voluptas"
"                     Exercet, dum laeta seges, dum trudere gemmas"
"                     Incipiunt vites, sitientiaque aetheris imbrem"
"                     Prata bibunt, ridentque satis surgentibus agri."
"                     Hanc vulgo speciem propriae penuria vocis"
"                     Intulit, indictisque urgens in rebus egestas."
"                     Quippe ubi se vera ostendebant nomina nusquam,"
"                     Fas erat hinc atque hinc transferre simillima veris."
"                     Poet.  3.  90."
"                  "
"               "
"               The beauties I have mentioned belong to every figure of speech. Several other beauties peculiar to one or other sort, I shall have occasion to remark afterward."
"               Not only subjects, but qualities, actions, effects, may be expressed figuratively. Thus"
"as to subjects, the gates of breath for the lips, the watery kingdom for the ocean. As to qualities, fierce for stormy, in the expres-sion Fierce winter: altus for profundus, al-tus puteus, altum mare: Breathing for per-spiring, Breathing plants. Again, as to ac-tions, the sea rages: Time will melt her frozen thoughts: Time kills grief. An ef-fect is put for the cause, as lux for the sun; and a cause for the effect, as boum labores for corn. The relation of resemblance is one plentiful source of figures of speech; and nothing is more common than to apply to one object the name of another that re-sembles it in any respect. Height, size, and wordly greatness, though in themselves they have no resemblance, produce emo-tions in the mind that have a resemblance; and, led by this resemblance, we naturally express worldly greatness by height or size. One feels a certain uneasiness in looking down to a great depth: and hence depth is made to express any thing disagreeable by excess; as depth of grief, depth of despair. Again, height of place and time long past, produce similar feelings; and hence the ex-pression,"
"                  Ut altius repetam. Distance in past time, producing a strong feeling, is put for any strong feeling: Nihil mihi antiquius nostra amicitia. Shortness with relation to space, for shortness with relation to time: Brevis esse laboro; obscurus fio. Suffering a punish-ment resembles paying a debt: hence pen-dere poenas. Upon the same account, light may be put for glory, sun-shine for prospe-rity, and weight for importance."
"               Many words, originally figurative, ha-ving, by long and constant use, lost their figurative power, are degraded to the infe-rior rank of proper terms. Thus the words that express the operations of the mind, have in all languages been originally figura-tive. The reason holds in all, that when these operations came first under considera  there was no other way of describing them but by what they resembled. It was not practicable to give them proper names, as may be done to objects that can be as-certained by sight and touch. A soft na-ture, jarring tempers, weight of wo, pom-pous phrase, beget compassion, assuage grief, break a vow, bend the eye downward, shower"
"                  "
"down curses, drowned in tears, wrapt in joy, warmed with eloquence, loaden with spoils, and a thousand other expressions of the like nature, have lost their figurative sense. Some terms there are, that cannot be said to be either purely figurative or altogether proper: originally figurative, they are tend to simplicity, without having lost alto-gether their figurative power. Virgil Regi-na saucia cura, is perhaps one of these ex-pressions. With ordinary readers, saucia will be considered as expressing simply the effect of grief; but one of a lively imagina will exalt the phrase into a figure."
"               To epitomise this subject, and at the same time to give a clear view of it, I can-not think of a better method, than to pre-sent to the reader a list of the several rela-tions upon which figures of speech are com-monly founded. This list I divide into two tables; one of subjects expressed figurative-ly, and one of attributes."
"               "
"                  "
"                  FIRST TABLE. Subjects expressed figuratively."
"                  1. A word proper to one subject employ figuratively to express a resembling sub-ject."
"There is no figure of speech so frequent, as what is derived from the relation of re-semblance. Youth, for example, is signi-fied figuratively by the morning of life. The life of a man resembles a natural day in se-veral particulars. The morning is the be-ginning of day, youth the beginning of life: the morning is chearful, so is youth; &amp  By another resemblance, a bold warrior is termed the thunderbolt of war; a multitude of troubles, a sea of troubles."
"                     No other figure of speech possesses so many different beauties, as that which is founded on resemblance. Beside the beau-ties above mentioned, common to all sorts, it possesses in particular the beauty of a me-taphor or of a simile. A figure of speech"
"built upon resemblance, suggests always a comparison between the principal subject and the accessory; and by this means every good effect of a metaphor or simile, may, in a short and lively manner, be produced by this figure of speech."
"                  "
"                  2. A word proper to the effect employed figuratively to express the cause."
"                        Lux for the sun. Shadow for cloud. A helmet is signified by the expression glitter terror. A tree by shadow or umbrage. Hence the expression,"
"                           Nec habet Pelion umbras."
"                           Ovid."

"                     "
"                     There is a peculiar force and beauty in this figure. The word which signifies fi-guratively the principal subject, denotes it to be a cause by suggesting the effect."

"                  "
"                     "

"                           Again Ulysses veiled his pensive head,"

"                  "
"                  4. Two things being intimately connect  the proper name of the one employed figuratively to signify the other."

"                        "

"'shall slightly retouch, with some additions peculiarly adapted to the present subject."
"               In the first place, as the figure under consideration is built upon relation, we find from experience, and it must be obvious from reason, that the beauty of the figure depends on the intimacy of the relation be-twixt the figurative and proper sense of the word. A slight resemblance, in parti-cular, will never make this figure agreeable. The expression, for example, drink down a secret, for listening to a secret with atten  is harsh and uncouth, because there is scarce any resemblance between listening and drinking. The expression weighty crack, used by Ben Johnson for loud crack, is worse if possible: a loud sound has not the slightest resemblance to a piece of mat-ter that is weighty. The following expres-sion of Lucretius is not less faulty. Et lepido quae sunt fucata sonore. i. 645."

"               Secondly, the proper sense of the word ought to bear some proportion to the figu-rative sense, and not soar much above it, nor sink much below it. This rule, as well as the foregoing, is finely illustrated by Vida:"

"Thirdly, in a figure of speech, every circumstance ought to be avoided that a-grees with the proper sense only, not the figurative sense; for it is the latter that expresses the thought, and the former serves for no other purpose but to make harmo-ny:"

"is nothing to the purpose where the subject is drinking ink figuratively."
"               In the fourth place, to draw consequen-ces from a figure of speech, as if the word were to be understood literally, is a gross absurdity, for it is confounding truth with fiction:"

"Neptune is here introduced personally, and not figuratively for the ocean: the descrip therefore, which is only applicable to the ocean, is altogether improper."
"               It is not sufficient, that a figure of speech be regularly constructed, and be free from blemish: it requires taste to discern when it is proper when improper; and taste, I su-spect, is the only guide we can rely on. One however may gather from reflection and ex-perience, that ornaments and graces suit not any of the dispiriting passions, nor are pro-per for expressing any thing grave and im-portant. In familiar conversation, they are in some measure ridiculous. Prospero in the Tempest, speaking to his daughter Mi-randa, says,"
"                     The fringed curtains of thine eyes advance,"
"                     And say what thou seest yond."
"                  "
"No exception can be taken to the justness of the figure; and circumstances may be i-magined to make it proper: but it is cer-tainly not proper in familiar conversation."
"               "
"                  "
"In the last place, though figures of speech have a charming effect when accurately con-structed and properly introduced, they ought however to be scattered with a sparing hand: nothing is more luscious, and nothing con-sequently more satiating, than redundant ornament of any kind."

"             XXI. Narration and Description."
"            HORACE, and many writers after him, give instructions for chusing a subject adapted to the genius of the author. But rules of criticism would be end-less, did one descend to peculiarities in ta-lent or genius. The aim of the present work is, to consider human nature in gene-ral, and to explore what is common to the species. The choice of a subject comes not under such a plan: but the manner of exe-cution comes under it; because the manner of execution is subjected to general rules These rules respect the things expressed, as well as the language or expression; which suggests a division of the present chapter into two parts; first of thoughts, and next of words. I pretend not to justify this di-vision as entirely accurate. In discoursing"
"of the thoughts, it is difficult to abstract al-together from words; and still more diffi-cult, in discoursing of the words, to abs-tract altogether from thought."
"            The first observation is, That the thoughts which embellish a narration ought to be chaste and solid. While the mind is intent upon facts, it is little disposed to the opera-rations of the imagination. Poetical ima-ges in a grave history are intolerable; and yet Strada Belgic history is full of poetical images. These being discordant with the subject, are disgustful; and they have a still worse effect, by giving an air of fiction to a genuine history. Such flowers ought to be scattered with a sparing hand, even in epic poetry; and at no rate are they proper, till the reader be warmed, and by an enlivened imagination be prepared to relish them: in that state of mind, they are extremely a-greeable. But while we are sedate and at-tentive to an historical chain of facts, we reject with disdain every fiction. This Belgic history is indeed wofully vicious both in matter and form: it is stuffed with"

"            VidaPoet.  2.  30., following Horace, recommends a modest commencement of an epic poem; giving for a reason, that the writer ought to husband his fire. This reason has weight; but what is said above suggests a reason still more weighty: Bold thoughts and figures are never relished till the mind be heated and thoroughly engaged, which is not the reader case at the commence-ment. Shakespear, in the first part of his history of Henry  begins with a senti-ment too bold for the most heated imagi-nation:"

"The passage with which Strada begins his history, is too poetical for a subject of that kind; and at any rate too high for the be-ginning of a grave performance. A third reason ought to have not less influence than either of the former: A man who, upon his first appearance, endeavours to exhibit all his talents, is never relished; the first periods of a work ought therefore to be short, natural, and simple. Cicero, in his oration pro Archia poeta, errs against this rule: his reader is out of breath at the very first period, which seems never to end. Burnet begins the history of his own times with a period long and intricate."
"            A third rule or observation is, That where the subject is intended for entertain-ment solely, not for instruction, a thing ought to be described as it appears, not as it is in reality. In running, for example, the impulse upon the ground is accurately pro-portioned to the celerity of motion: in ap-pearance"

"            Fourthly, In narration as well as in scription, facts and objects ought to be painted so accurately as to form in the mind of the reader distinct and lively images. Every useless circumstance ought indeed to be suppressed, because every such circum-stance loads the narration; but if a circum-stance be necessary, however slight, it can-not be described too minutely. The force of language consists in raising complete ima-gesPart 1.  6.; which cannot be done till the read-er, forgetting himself, be transported as by magic into the very place and time of the important action, and be converted, as it were, into a real spectator, beholding every thing that passes. In this view, the narra-tive in an epic poem ought to rival a picture"
"in the liveliness and accuracy of its repre-sentations: no circumstance must be omit-ted that tends to make a complete image; because an imperfect image, as well as any other imperfect conception, is cold and un-interresting.

"            It is observed above, that every useless circumstance ought to be suppressed. To deal in such circumstances, is a fault, on the one hand, not less to be avoided, than the conciseness for which Voltaire is blamed, on the other. In the Aeneid"

And that it might not be thought unjust in Dido, even in this trivial incident, to prefer her husband nurse be-fore her own, the poet takes care to in-form his reader, that Dido nurse was dead. To this I must oppose a beautiful passage in the same book, where, after Di-do last speech, the poet, supposing her"

The lan-guage proper for expressing passion is the subject of a former chapter. Several obser-vations there made, are applicable to the present subject; particularly, That words are"
"intimately connected with the ideas they re-present, and that the representation cannot be perfect unless the emotions raised by the sound and the sense be concordant. It is not sufficient, that the sense be clearly expres-sed: the words must correspond to the sub-ject in every particular. An elevated sub-ject requires an elevated style: what is fa-miliar, ought to be familiarly expressed: a subject that is serious and important, ought to be cloathed in plain nervous language: a description, on the other hand, addressed to the imagination, is susceptible of the high-est ornaments that sounding words, meta-phor, and figurative expression, can be-stow upon it."

"            The language of Homer is suited to his subject, not less accurately than the actions and sentiments of his heroes are to their characters. Virgil, in this particular, falls short of perfection: his language is stately throughout; and though he descends at times to the simplest branches of cookery, roasting and boiling for example, yet he ne-ver relaxes a moment from the high toneSee Aeneid.  i. 188.—219..

"            It is proper to be observed upon this head, that writers of inferior rank are continually upon the stretch to enliven and enforce their subject by exaggeration and superlatives. This unluckily has an effect opposite to what is intended: the reader, disgusted with language that swells above the subject, is led by contrast to think more meanly of the subject than it may possibly deserve. A man of prudence, beside, will be not less careful to husband his strength in writing than in walking: a writer too liberal of su-perlatives, exhausts his whole stock upon ordinary incidents, and reserves no share to"
"express, with greater energy, matters of importanceMontaigne, reflecting upon the then present modes, ob-serves, that there never was at any other time so abject and servile prostitution of words in the addresses made by people of fashion to one another; the humblest tenders of life and soul, no professions under that of devotion and adoration; the wri-ter constantly declaring himself a vassal, nay a slave: so that when any more serious occasion of friendship or gratitude requires more genuine professions, words are wanting to ex-press them.."
"            The power that language possesses to i-mitate thought, goes farther than to the ca-pital circumstances above mentioned: it reacheth even the slighter modifications. Slow action, for example, is imitated by words pronounced slow; labour or toil, by words harsh or rough in their sound. But this subject has been already handledCh. 18.  3.."

"            I proceed to a second remark, not less important than the former. No person of reflection but must be sensible, that an inci-dent makes a stronger impression on an eye-witness, than when heard at second hand. Writers of genius, sensible that the eye is the best avenue to the heart, repre-sent every thing as passing in our sight; and from readers or hearers, transform us, as it were, into spectators. A skilful writer conceals himself, and presents his person-ages. In a word, every thing becomes dra-matic as much as possible. Plutarch, gloria Atheniensium, observes, that Thucy-dides makes his reader a spectator, and in-spires him with the same passions as if he were an eye-witness. I am intitled to"
"make the same observation upon our coun-tryman Swift. From this happy talent a-rises that energy of style which is peculiar to him: he cannot always avoid narration; but the pencil is his choice, by which he bestows life and colouring upon his objects. Pope is richer in ornament, but possesses not in the same degree the talent of draw from the life. A translation of the sixth satire of Horace, begun by the former and finished by the latter, affords the fairest opportunity for a comparison. Pope ob-viously imitates the picturesque manner of his friend: yet every one of taste must be sensible, that the imitation, though fine, falls short of the original. In other instan-ces, where Pope writes in his own style, the difference of manner is still more con-spicuous."

"                     By the Lord, I knew ye, as well as he that made ye. Why, hear ye, my masters; was it for me to kill the heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince? Why, thou knowest, I am as valiant as Hercules; but beware instinct, the lion will not touch the true prince: instinct is a great matter. I was a coward on instinct: I shall think the better of myself, and thee, during my life; I, for a valiant lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap to the doors; watch to-night, pray to-morrow. Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be merry? shall we have a play extempore?"

"                  What mean ye, that ye use this proverb, The fathers have eaten four grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge? As I live, saith the Lord"
"God, ye shall not have occasion to use this proverb in Israel. If a man keep my judgements to deal truly, he is just, he shall surely live. But if he be a robber, a shedder of blood; if he have eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour wife; if he have oppressed the poor and needy, have spoiled by violence, have not restored the pledge, have lift up his eyes to idols, have given forth upon usury, and have taken increase: shall he live? he shall not live: he shall surely die; and his blood shall be upon him. Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father sins, and considereth, and doth not such like; that hath not eaten upon the mountains, hath not lift up his eyes to idols, nor defiled his neighbour wife, hath not oppressed any nor with-held the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and covered the naked with a gar-ment; that hath not received usury nor increase, that hath executed my judgments, and walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall surely live. The soul that sin-neth, it shall die: the son shall not bear the ini-quity of the father; neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. Have I any pleasure that the wicked should die? saith the Lord"

"The repetitions in Homer, which are fre-quent, have been the occasion of much cri-ticism. Suppose we were at a loss about the reason, might not taste be sufficient to justify them? At the same time, one must be devoid of understanding not to be sen-sible, that they make the narration drama-tic; and give an air of truth, by making things appear as passing in our sight."
"            A concise comprehensive style is a great ornament in narration; and a superfluity of unnecessary words, not less than of circum-stances, a great nuisance. A judicious se-lection of the striking circumstances, cloath in a nervous style, is delightful. In this style, Tacitus excels all writers, ancient and modern. Instances are numberless: take the following specimen."
"                  Crebra hinc praelia, et saepius in modum latroci-nii: per saltus, per paludes; ut cuique fors aut virtus: temere, proviso, ob iram, ob praedam, jus-su, et aliquando ignaris ducibus."

"            I close this chapter with a curious in-quiry. An object, however ugly to the sight, is far from being so when repre-sented by colours or by words. What is the cause of this difference? The cause with respect to painting is obvious. A good picture, whatever the subject be, is agree-able, because of the pleasure we take in imi-tation: the agreeableness of imitation over-balances the disagreeableness of the subject; and the picture upon the whole is agree-able. It requires a greater compass to ex-plain the cause with respect to the description of an ugly object. To connect individuals in the social state, no one particular contri-butes more than language, by the power it"
"possesses of an expeditious communication of thought and a lively representation of transactions. But nature hath not been sa-tisfied to recommend language by its utility merely: it is made susceptible of many beauties that have no relation to utility, which are directly felt without the inter-vention of any reflectionSee  18.. And this un-folds the mystery; for the pleasure of lan-guage is so great, as in a lively description to overbalance the disagreeableness of the image raised by itSee  2. part 4.. This however is no encouragement to deal in disagreeable sub-jects; for the pleasure is out of sight greater where the subject and the description are both of them agreeable."

"             XXII. Epic and Dramatic Compositions."
"            TRAGEDY differs from the epic more in form than in substance. The ends proposed by each are instruc and amusement; and each of them co-py human actions as means to bring about these ends. They differ in the manner on-ly of copying. Epic poetry deals in narra  Tragedy represents its facts as trans-acted in our sight. In the former, the poet introduces himself as an historian: in the latter he presents his actors and never him-selfThe dialogue in a dramatic composition separates it so clearly from other compositions, that no writer has thought it necessary to search for any other distinguishing mark. But much useless labour has been bestowed, to distinguish an epic poem by some such mark. Bossu defines this poem to be, A composition in verse, intended to form the manners by in-structions disguised under the allegories of an importantaction, which will exclude every epic poem founded upon real facts, and perhaps include several of Esop fables. Voltaire reckons verse so essential, as for that single reason to exclude the ventures of Telemachus. See his Essay upon Epic Poetry. Others, affected with substance more than with ornament, he-sitate not to pronounce that poem to be epic. It is not a little diverting, to see so many shallow critics hunting for what is not to be found. They always take for granted, without the least foundation, that there must be some precise criterion to distinguish epic poetry from every other species of writing. Literary compositions run into each other, precisely like co-lours: in their strong tints they are easily distinguished; but are susceptible of so much variety, and take on so many dif-ferent forms, that we never can say where one species ends and another begins. As to the general taste, there is little reason to doubt, that a work where heroic actions are rela-ted in an elevated style, will, without further requisite, be deemed an epic poem.."
"            "
"               "
"This difference, regarding form only, may be thought slight; but the effects it occasions, are by no means so. What we see, makes a stronger impression than what we learn from others. A narrative poem is a story told by another: facts and inci-dents passing upon the stage, come under our own observation; and are beside much enlivened by action and gesture, expressive of many sentiments beyond the reach of language"
"            "
"               "
"A dramatic composition has another pro-perty, independent altogether of action. A dialogue makes a deeper impression than a narration: because in the former persons ex-press their own sentiments; whereas in the latter sentiments are related at second hand. For that reason, Aristotle, the father of critics, lays it down as a rule, That in an pic poem the author ought to take every opportunity to introduce his actors, and to confine the narrative part within the narrow-est boundsPoet. ch. 25.  6.. Homer understood perfect-ly the advantage of this method; and his poems are both of them in a great measure dramatic. Lucan runs to the opposite ex-treme; and is guilty of a still greater fault: the Pharsalia is stuffed with cold and lan-guid reflections; the merit of which the au-thor assumes to himself, and deigns not to share with his personages. Nothing can be more impertinent, than a chain of such re-flections, which suspend the battle of Phar-salia after the leaders had made their speech-es,"
"A comparison by contrast may contribute to grandeur or elevation, not less than by resemblance; of which the following com-parison of Lucan is a remarkable instance."
"Victrix causa diis placuit, sed victa Catoni."
"Considering that the Heathen deities pos-sessed a rank but one degree above that of mankind, I think it scarce possible, by a single expression, to elevate or dignify more one of the human species, than is done by this comparison. I am sensi-ble, at the same time, that such a compa-rison among Christians, who entertain juster notions of the Deity, would justly be rec-koned extravagant and absurd."
"            The last article mentioned, is that of lessening or depressing a hated or disagree-able object; which is effectually done by resembling it to any thing that is low or spicable. Thus Milton, in his description of the rout of the rebel-angels, happily expresses their terror and dismay in the following simile."
"                  "
"and the two armies are ready to en-gageLib. 7. from line 385. to line 460.."
"            Aristotle, from the nature of the fable, divides tragedy into simple and complex. But it is of greater moment, with respect to dramatic as well as epic poetry, to found a distinction upon the different ends attained by such compositions. A poem, whether dramatic or epic, that hath no tendency be-yond moving the passions and exhibiting pictures of virtue and vice, may be distin-guished by the name of pathetic. But where a story is purposely contrived to illu-strate some important lesson of morality, by showing the natural connection between dis-orderly passions and external misfortunes, such composition may be denominated mo-ral"
"               The same distinction is applicable to that sort of fable which is said to be the invention of Aesop. A moral, it is true, is by all critics considered as essential to such a fable. But nothing is more common, than to be led blindly by authority. Of the numerous collections I have seen, the fables that clear-ly inculcate a moral, make a very small part. In many fables, indeed, proper pictures of virtue and vice are exhibited: but the bulk of these collections convey no instruction, nor afford any amusement beyond what a child receives in reading an ordinary story.. It indeed conveys moral instruc-tion"
"with a perspicuity that is not exceeded by the most accurate reasoning; and makes a deeper impression than any moral dis-course can do. To be satisfied of this, we need but reflect, that a man whose affec-tions are justly balanced, hath a better chance to escape misfortunes, than one who is a slave to every passion. Indeed, no-thing is more evident, than the natural connection that vice hath with misery, and virtue with happiness; and such connec may be illustrated, by stating a fact as well as by urging an argument. Let us as-sume, for example, the following moral truths, That discord among the chiefs, ren-ders ineffectual all common measures; and that the consequences of a slightly-founded quarrel, fostered by pride and arrogance, are not less fatal than those of the grossest injury. These truths may be inculcated, by the quar-rel between Agamemnon and Achilles at the siege of Troy. In this view, it ought to be the poet chief aim, to invent proper cir-cumstances,"
"presenting to our view the na-tural consequences of such discord. These circumstances must seem to arise in the com-mon course of human affairs: no acciden-tal or unaccountable event ought to be in-dulged; for the necessary or probable con-nection between vice and misery, is learned from no events but what are governed by the characters and passions of the persons represented. A real event of which we see no cause, may be a lesson to us; because what hath happened may again happen: but this cannot be inferred from a story that is known to be fictitious."
"            Many are the good effects of such com-positions. A pathetic composition, whe-ther epic or dramatic, tends to a habit of virtue, by exciting emotions that produce good actions, and avert us from those that are vicious or irregularSee  2. part 1.  3.. It likewise, by its frequent pictures of human woes, hu-manizes the mind, and fortifies us in bear our own misfortunes. A moral com-position must obviously produce the same good effects, because by being moral it doth"
"not cease to be pathetic. It enjoys beside an excellence peculiar to itself: for it not only improves the heart, as above mention  but instructs the head by the moral it contains. For my part, I cannot imagine any entertainment more suited to a rational being, than a work thus happily illustrating some moral truth; where a number of per-sons of different characters are engaged in an important action, some retarding, others promoting, the great catastrophe; and where there is dignity of style as well as of matter. A work of this kind, has our sympathy at command, and can put in mo the whole train of the social affections. We have at the same time great mental en-joyment, in perceiving every event and very subordinate incident connected with its proper cause. Our curiosity is by turns ex-cited and gratified; and our delight is con-summated at the close, upon finding, from the characters and situations exhibited at the commencement, that every circumstance down to the final catastrophe is natural, and that the whole in conjunction make a regu-lar chain of causes and effects."
"            "
"               "
"Considering an epic and dramatic poem as the same in substance, and having the same aim or end, it might be thought that they are equally fitted for the same subjects. But considering their difference as to form, there will be found reason to correct that thought, at least in some degree. Many subjects may indeed be treated with equal advantage in either form; but the subjects are still more numerous for which one of the forms is better qualified than the other; and there are subjects proper for the one and not for the other. To give some slight notion of the difference, as there is no room here for enlarging upon every article, I ob-serve, that dialogue is better qualified for expressing sentiments, and narrative for dis-playing facts. These peculiarities tend to confine each within certain limits. He-roism, magnanimity, undaunted courage, and the whole tribe of the elevated virtues, figure best in action: tender passions and the whole tribe of sympathetic affections, figure best in sentiment. What we feel is the most remarkable in the latter: what we perform is the most remarkable in the"
"former. It clearly follows, that tender passions are more peculiarly the province of tragedy, grand and heroic actions of epic poetryIn Racine, tender sentiments prevail; in Corneille, grand and heroic manners. Hence clearly the preference of the former before the latter, as dramatic poets. Corneille would figure better in an heroic poem.."
"            I have no occasion to say more upon the epic, considered as peculiarly adapted to certain subjects. But as dramatic subjects are more complex, I must take a narrower view of them; which I do the more wil-lingly, in order to clear a point thrown into great obscurity by critics."
"            In the chapter of emotions and passionsPart 4., it is occasionally shown, that the subject best fitted for tragedy is the story of a man who has himself been the cause of his mis-fortune. But this man must neither be deeply guilty nor altogether innocent. The misfortune must be occasioned by a fault in-cident to human nature, and therefore ve-nial. Misfortunes of this kind, call forth the whole force of the social affections, and"
"interest the spectator in the warmest man-ner. An accidental misfortune, if not ex-termely singular, doth not greatly move our pity. The person who suffers, being inno-cent, is freed from the greatest of all tor-ments, viz. the anguish of mind occasioned by remorse:"

"A criminal, on the other hand, who brings misfortunes upon himself, excites little pity, for a different reason. His re-morse, it is true, aggravates his distress, and swells the first emotions of pity: but then our hatred to the criminal blending with pi-ty, blunts its edge considerably. Misfor-tunes that are not innocent nor highly cri-minal, partake the advantages of each ex-treme: they are attended with remorse to embitter the distress, which raises our pity to a great height; and the slight indignation we have at a venial fault, detracts not sen-sibly"
"from our pity. For this reason, the happiest of all subjects for tragedy, if such a one could be invented, would be where a man of integrity falls into a great misfortune by doing an innocent action, but which by some singular means he conceives to be criminal. His remorse aggravates his di-stress; and our compassion, unrestrained by indignation, rises to its highest pitch. Pity comes thus to be the ruling passion of a pa-thetic tragedy; and by proper representa  may be raised to a height scarce ex-ceeded by any thing felt in real life. A moral tragedy takes in a larger field; for, beside exercising our pity, it raises another passion, selfish indeed, but which deserves to be cherished equally with the social af-fections. When a misfortune is the natu-ral consequence of some wrong bias in the temper, every spectator who is conscious of some such defect in himself, takes the a-larm, and considers that he is liable to the same misfortune. This consideration raises in him an emotion of fear or terror; and it is by this emotion, frequently reiterated in a variety of moral tragedies, that the"
"'spectators are put upon their guard against the disorders of passion."
"            The commentators upon Aristotle and ther critics, have been much graveled a-bout the account given of tragedy by this author, That by means of pity and terror it refines in us all sorts of passion. But no one who has a clear conception of the end and effects of a good tragedy, can have any difficulty about Aristotle meaning. Our pity is engaged for the persons represented, and our terror is upon our own account. Pity indeed is here made to stand for all the sympathetic emotions, because of these it is the capital. There can be no doubt, that our sympathetic emotions are refined or im-proved by daily exercise; and in what man-ner our other passions are refined by terror I have just now said. One thing is certain, that no other meaning can justly be given to the foregoing doctrine than that now mentioned; and that it was really Aristotle meaning, appears from his 13th chapter, where he delivers several propositions agree-able to the doctrine as here explained. These, at the same time, I the rather chuse"
"to mention; because, so far as authority can go, they confirm the foregoing reason about the proper subjects for tragedy. His first proposition is, That it being the province of tragedy to excite pity and ter-ror, an innocent person falling into adversi-ty ought never to be the subject. This proposition is a necessary consequence of his doctrine as explained: a subject of this nature may indeed excite pity and terror; but the former in an inferior gree, and the latter in no degree for moral instruction. The second proposition is, That we must not represent a wicked per-son emerging from misery to good fortune. This excites neither terror nor compassion, nor is agreeable in any respect. The third is, That the misfortunes of a wicked person ought not to be represented. Such representation may be agreeable in some measure upon a principle of justice: but it will not move our pity; or any degree of ter-ror, except in those of the same vicious dispo-sition with the person represented. His last proposition is, That the only character fit for"

"In the same view, Homer, I think, may be defended, in comparing the shouts of the Trojans in battle, to the noise of cranesBeginning of book 3., and to the bleating of a flock of sheepBook 4.  498.: and it is no objection, that these are low i-mages; for by opposing the noisy march of the Trojans to the silent and manly march of the Greeks, he certainly intended to lessen the former.

"representation lies in the middle, neither minently good nor eminently bad; where the misfortune is not the effect of delibe-rate vice, but of some involuntary fault, as our author expresses itIf one can be amused with a grave discourse which pro-miseth much and performs nothing, he may see this subject treated by Brumoy in his Theatre Grec. Preliminary discourse on the origin of tragedy.. The only objec I find to Aristotle account of tragedy, is, that he confines it within too narrow bounds, by refusing admittance to the pa-thetic kind. For if terror be essential to tragedy, no representation deserves that name, but where the misfortunes exhibited are caused by a wrong balance of mind, or some disorder in the internal constitution. Such misfortunes always suggest moral in-struction; and by such misfortunes only can terror be excited for our improvement."
"            Thus Aristotle four propositions above mentioned, relate solely to tragedies of the moral kind. Those of the pathetic kind, are not confined within so narrow limits. Subjects fitted for the theatre, are not in such plenty, as to make us reject innocent"
"misfortunes which rouse our sympathy, though they inculcate no moral. With re-spect to subjects of this kind, it may indeed be a doubtful question, whether the con-clusion ought not always to be happy. Where a person of integrity is represented as suffering to the end under misfortunes purely accidental, we depart discontented, and with some obscure sense of injustice; for seldom is man so submissive to the course of Providence, as not to revolt against the tyranny and vexations of blind chance: he will be inclined to say, This ought not to be. I give for an example the Romeo and Juliet of Shakespear, where the fatal catastrophe is occasioned by Friar Laurence coming to the monument a minute too late. Such a story we think of with regret: we are vexed at the unlucky chance, and go away dissatisfied. This is a temper of mind which ought not to be cherished; and for that reason, I vote for excluding stories of this kind from the theatre. The misfor-tunes of a virtuous person arising from ne-cessary causes, or from a chain of unavoid-able circumstances, will, I am apt to think,"
"be considered in a different light. Chance affords always a gloomy prospect, and in every instance gives an impression of anar-chy and misrule. A regular chain, on the other hand, of causes and effects, directed by the general laws of nature, never fails to suggest the hand of Providence; to which we submit without resentment, being con-scious that submission is our dutySee essays on the principles of morality, edit. 2.  291.. For that reason, we are not dissatisfied with the distresses of Voltaire Mariamne, though redoubled on her till the moment of her death, without the least fault or failing on her part. Her misfortunes are owing to a cause extremely natural, and not unfre-quent, the jealousy of a barbarous husband. The fate of Desdemona in the Moor of Ve-nice, affects us in the same manner. We are not so easily reconciled to the fate of Cordelia in King Lear: the causes of her misfortune, are by no means so evident, as to exclude the gloomy notion of chance. In short, it appears, that a perfect charac-ter suffering under misfortunes is qualified"
"for being the subject of a pathetic tragedy, provided chance be excluded. Nor is it altogether inconsistent with a moral trage-dy: it may successfully be introduced as an under-part, supposing the chief place to be filled with an imperfect character from which a moral can be drawn. This is the case of Desdemona and Mariamne just now mentioned; and it is the case of Monimia and Belvidera, in Otway two tragedies, The Orphan, and Venice preserved."

"            I had an early opportunity to unfold a curious doctrine, That fable operates on our passions, by representing its events as pass in our sight, and by deluding us into a conviction of realityChap. 2. part 1.  6.. Hence, in epic and dramatic compositions, it is of importance to employ every means that may promote the delusion, such as the borrowing from history some noted event, with the addition of circumstances that may answer the au-thor purpose. The principal facts are known to be true; and we are disposed to extend our belief to every circumstance."
"But in chusing a subject that makes a figure in history, greater precaution is necessary than where the whole is invented. In the first place, no circumstances must be added, but such as connect naturally with what are known to be true: history may be sup-plied, but it must not be contradicted. In the next place, a pure fable, entirely new with respect to the persons as well as the incidents, may be supposed an ancient or a modern story. But if the poet build upon truth, the subject he chuses must be distant in time, or at least in place; for he ought by all means to avoid the familiarity of persons and events nearly connected with us. Familiarity ought more especially to be avoided in an epic poem, the peculiar character of which is dignity and elevation. Modern manners make but a poor figure in such a poemI would not from this observation be thought to underva-lue modern manners. The roughness, plainness, and impe-tuosity of ancient manners, may show better in an epic poem, without being better fitted for society. But without regard to this circumstance, it is the familiarity of modern manners that unqualifies them for a lofty subject. The dignity of our pre-sent manners, will be better understood in suture ages when they have become ancient.."
"            "
"               "
"After Voltaire, no writer, it is probable, will think of erecting an epic poem upon a recent event in the history of his own country. But an event of this kind is per-haps not altogether unqualified for tragedy. It was admitted in Greece, and Shakespear has employed it successfully in several of his pieces. One advantage it possesses above fiction, that of more readily engaging our belief, which tends above any other parti-cular to raise our sympathy. The scene of comedy is generally laid at home: famili-arity is no objection; and we are peculiarly sensible of the ridicule of our own manners."
"            After a proper subject is chosen, there appears to me some delicacy in dividing it into parts. The conclusion of a book in an epic poem, or of an act in a play, cannot be altogether arbitrary; nor be intended for so slight a purpose as to make the parts of equal length. The supposed pause at the end of every book, and the real pause at the end of every act, ought always to coincide with some pause in the action. In this re-spect,"
"a dramatic or epic poem, ought to resemble a sentence or period in language, divided into members that are distinguished from each other by regular pauses: or it ought to resemble a piece of music, having a full close at the end, preceded by imper-fect closes that contribute to the melody. Every act therefore ought to close with some incident that makes a pause in the action; for otherwise there can be no pretext for in-terrupting the representation. It would be absurd to break off in the very heat of action: against this every one would exclaim. The absurdity still remains, though the action relents, if it be not actually suspended for some time. This rule is also applicable to an epic poem; though there a deviation from the rule is less remarkable, because it is in the reader power to hide the ab-surdity, by proceeding instantly to another book. The first book of the Paradise Lost, ends without any regular close, perfect or imperfect: it breaks off abruptly, where Satan, seated on his throne, is prepared to make a speech to the convocated host of the fall angels; and the second book be-gins"
"with the speech. Milton seems to have copied the Aeneid, of which the two first books are divided much in the same manner. Neither is there any proper pause at the end of the fifth book of the Aeneid. There is no proper pause at end of the se-venth book of Paradise Lost, nor at the end of the eleventh."
"            Hitherto I have carried on together the epic and dramatic compositions. I proceed to handle them separately, and to mention circumstances peculiar to each, beginning with the epic kind. In a theatrical enter-tainment, which employs both the eye and the ear, it would be a monstrous ab-surdity to introduce upon the stage invisible beings in a visible shape. But it has been much disputed, whether such beings may not be properly introduced in an epic poem. If we rest upon the authority of practice, we must declare for the affirmative; and BoileauThird part of his art of poetry., among many other critics, is a stout champion for this sort of machinery. But waving authority, which is apt to im-pose"
"upon the judgement, let us draw what light we can from reason. I begin with a preliminary remark, That this matter is but indistinctly handled by critics. It is laid down above, that several passions incite the mind to animate its objectsChap. 20.  1.: the moral virtues become so many goddesses, and even darts and arrows are inspired with life and action. But then it must not be overlook  that such personification, being the work of imagination, is descriptive only, and assumes not even an appearance of truthIbid.. This is very different from what is termed machinery, where deities, angels, devils, or other supernatural powers, are introduced as real personages, mixing in the action, and contributing to the catastro-phe; and yet these two things are con-stantly jumbled together in the reasoning. The poetical privilege of animating insen-sible objects for the sake of description, can-not be controverted, because it is founded on a natural principle. But has the privi-lege of machinery, if it be a privilege, the"
"'same good foundation? Far from it: no-thing can be more unnatural. Its effects, at the same time, are deplorable. First, it gives an air of fiction to the whole; and prevents that impression of reality which is requisite to interest our affections, and to move our passionsSee  2. part 1.  6.. This of itself is suffi-cient to explode machinery, whatever en-tertainment it may give to readers of a fan-tastic taste or irregular imagination. And next, were it possible to disguise the fiction, and to delude us into a notion of reality, which I think can hardly be, an insuper-able objection would still remain, which is, that the aim or end of an epic poem can never be accomplished in any perfection where machinery is introduced. Virtuous emotions cannot be raised successfully but by the actions of those who are endued with passions and affections like our own, that is, by human actions. And as for moral in-struction, it is evident, that we can draw none from beings who act not upon the same principles with us. A fable in Aesop's"
"their pride by comparing them to a swarm of pismires."
"            A comparison that has none of the good effects mentioned in this discourse, but is built upon common and trifling circumstan-ces, makes a mighty silly figure: Non sum nescius, grandia consilia a multis plerumque causis, ceu magna navigia a plurimis remis, impelliStrada bello Belgico.."
"            "
"            By this time I imagine the different pur-poses of comparison, and the various im-pressions it makes on the mind, are suffi-ciently illustrated by proper examples. This was an easy work. It is more difficult to lay down rules about the propriety or impro-priety of comparisons; in what circumstances they may be introduced, and in what circum-stances they are out of place. It is evident, that a comparison is not proper upon every occasion; a man in his cool and sedate moments, is not disposed to poetical flights, nor to sacrifice truth and reality to the delu-sive operations of the imagination; far less is he so disposed, when oppressed with cares, or interested in some important transaction"
"manner is no objection to this reasoning. His lions, bulls, and goats, are truly men under disguise: they act and feel in every respect as human beings; and the moral we draw is founded on that supposition. Homer, it is true, introduces the gods into his fable; and he was authorised to take that liberty by the religion of his country; it being an article in the Grecian creed, that the gods often interpose visibly and bodily in human affairs. I must however ob-serve, that Homer deities do no honour to his poems. Fictions that transgress the bounds of nature, seldom have a good ef-fect: they may inflame the imagination for a moment, but will not be relished by any person of a correct taste. Let me add, that of whatever use such fictions may be to a mean genius, an able writer has much finer materials of Nature production for eleva-ting his subject, and making it interesting."
"            Boileau, a strenuous advocate for the Heathen deities, as observed, declares a-gainst angels and devils, though supported by the religious creed of his country. One would be apt to imagine, that a critic fa-med"
"for his good taste, could have no other meaning than to justify the employing Hea-then deities for enlivening or elevating the description. But as the Heathen deities make not a better figure in poetical lan-guage than angels and devils, Boileau, in pleading for the former, certainly meant, if he had any distinct meaning, that these may be introduced as actors. And, in fact, he himself is guilty of this glaring absurdi-ty, where it is not so pardonable as in an epic poem. In his ode upon the taking of Na-mur, he demands with a most serious countenance, whether the walls were built by Apollo or Neptune; and in relating the passage of the Rhine, anno 1672, he scribes the god of that river as fighting with all his might to oppose the French mo-narch. This is confounding fiction with reality at a strange rate. The French wri-ters in general run into this error: wonder-ful! that they should not be sensible how ridiculous it is."
"            That this is a capital error in the Gieru-salleme liberata, Tasso greatest admirers must acknowledge. A situation can never"
"be intricate, nor the reader ever in pain a-bout the catastrophe, so long as there is an angel, devil, or magician, to lend a helping hand. Voltaire, in his essay upon epic poe-try, talking of the Pharsalia, observes judi-ciously, That the proximity of time, the notoriety of events, the character of the age, enlightened and political, joined with the solidity of Lucan subject, prived him of all liberty of poetical fic  Is it not amazing, that a critic who reasons so justly with respect to others; can be so blind with respect to himself?

"makes a bad figure at any rate; and is in-tolerable in a history so recent as that of Henry  This singly is sufficient to make the Henriade a short-lived poem, were it therwise possessed of every beauty. I have tried serious reasoning upon this subject; but ridicule, I suppose, will be found a more successful weapon, which Addison has ap-plied in an elegant manner: Whereas the time of a general peace is, in all ap-pearance, drawing near; being informed that there are several ingenious persons who intend to shew their talents on so happy an occasion, and being willing, as much as in me lies, to prevent that effusion of nonsense which we have good cause to apprehend; I do hereby strictly re-quire every person who shall write on this subject, to remember that he is a Christian, and not to sacrifice his cate-chism to his poetry. In order to it, I do expect of him in the first place, to make his own poem, without depending upon Phoebus for any part of it, or call out for aid upon any of the mu-ses by name. I do likewise positively

forbid the sending of Mercury with any particular message or dispatch relating to the peace; and shall by no means suffer Minerva to take upon her the shape of any plenipotentiary concerned in this great work. I do further declare, that I shall not allow the destinies to have had an hand in the deaths of the several thousands who have been slain in the late war; being of opinion that all such deaths may be very well accounted for by the Christian system of powder and ball. I do therefore strictly forbid the fates to cut the thread of man life upon any pretence whatsoever, unless it be for the sake of the rhyme. And whereas I have good reason to fear, that Neptune will have a great deal of business on his hands in several poems which we may now suppose are upon the anvil, I do also prohibit his appearance, unless it be done in metaphor, simile, or any very short allusion; and that even here he be not permitted to enter, but with great caution and circumspection. I desire that the same rule may be extended to his

whole fraternity of Heathen gods; it be my design to condemn every poem to the flames in which Jupiter thunders, or exercises any other act of authority which does not belong to him. In short, I expect that no Pagan agent shall be in-troduced, or any fact related which a man cannot give credit to with a good conscience.

"            The marvellous is indeed so much pro-moted by machinery, that it is not won-derful to find it embraced by the bulk of writers, and perhaps of readers. If indul-ged at all, it is generally indulged to ex-cess. Homer introduces his deities with no greater ceremony than his mortals; and Virgil has still less moderation: an over-watched pilot cannot fall asleep and drop into the sea by natural means: the two"
"lovers, Aeneas and Dido, cannot take the same bed, without the immediate interpo-sition of superior powers. The ridiculous in such fictions, must appear even through the thickest vail of gravity and solemnity."
"            Angels and devils serve equally with the Heathen deities, as materials for figurative language, perhaps better among Christians, because we believe in them, and not in the Heathen deities. But every one is sensible, as well as Boileau, that the invisible powers in our creed make a much worse figure as actors in a modern poem, than the invisi-ble powers in the Heathen creed did in an-cient poems. The reason I take to be what follows. The Heathen deities, in the opi-nion of their votaries, were beings elevated one step only above mankind, actuated by the same passions, and directed by the same motives; therefore not altogether improper to mix with mankind in an important ac  In our creed, superior beings are placed at such a mighty distance from us, and are of a nature so different, that with no propriety can they appear with us upon the same stage. Man is a creature so much in-ferior,"
"that he loses all dignity when set in opposition."
"            There seems to be no doubt, that an historical poem admits the embellishment of allegory, as well as of metaphor, simile, or other figure. Moral truth, in particular, is finely illustrated in the allegorical manner. It amuses the fancy to find abstract terms, by a sort of magic, converted into active beings; and it is delightful to trace a gene-ral proposition in a pictured event. But allegorical beings should be confined within their own sphere; and never be admitted to mix in the principal action, nor to co perate in retarding or advancing the catastro-phe. This would have a still worse effect, than the introduction of invisible powers; and I am ready to assign the reason. An historical fable affords entertainment chiefly by making us conceive its personages to be really existing and acting in our presence: in an allegory, this agreeable delusion is denied; for we must not imagine an alle-gorical personage to be a real being, but the figure only of some virtue or vice; other-wise the allegory is lost. The impression"
"of real existence, essential to an epic poem, is inconsistent with that figurative existence which is essential to an allegory; and there-fore no method can be more effectual to destroy the impression of reality, than to introduce allegorical beings co-operating with those whom we conceive to be really existing. The love-episode in the Hen-riade"
"               Canto 9., is insufferable by the discordant mixture of allegory with real life. This episode is copied from that of Rinaldo and Armida in the Gierusalemme liberata, which hath no merit to intitle it to be copied. An allegorical object, such as fame in the Aeneid, and the temple of love in the Hen-riade, may find place in a description: but to introduce Discord as a real personage, imploring the assistance of Love as another real personage, to enervate the courage of the hero, is making these figurative be-ings act beyond their sphere, and creating a strange jumble of discordant materials, viz. truth and fiction. The allegory of Sin and Death in the Paradise Lost, is, I pre-sume,"
"not generally relished, though it is not entirely of the same nature with what I have been condemning. The Paradise Lost is not confined to the history of our first parents; and in a work comprehending the atchievements of superior beings, there is more room for fancy than where it is con-fined to human actions."
"            What is the true notion of an episode? or how is it to be distinguished from what is really a part of the principal action? Every incident that promotes or retards the cata-strophe, must be a part of the principal ac  This clears the nature of an episode; which may be defined, An incident con-nected with the principal action, but which contributes not either to advance or retard it. The descent of Aeneas into hell doth not advance or retard the cata-strophe; and therefore is an episode. The story of Nisus and Euryalus, producing an alteration in the affairs of the contending parties, is a part of the principal action. The family-scene in the sixth book of the Iliad is of the same nature: by Hector retiring from the field of battle to visit his"
"that occupies him totally. The region of comparison and of all figurative expression, lies between these two extremes. It is ob-servable, that a man, when elevated or ani-mated by any passion, is disposed to elevate or animate all his objects: he avoids familiar names, exalts objects by circumlocution and metaphor, and gives even life and voluntary action to inanimate beings. In this warmth of mind, the highest poetical flights are in-dulged, and the boldest similes and meta-phors relishedIt is accordingly observed by Longinus, in his treatise of the Sublime, that the proper time for metaphor, is when the passions are so swelled as to hurry on like a torrent.. But without soaring so high, the mind is frequently in a tone to relish chaste and moderate ornament; such as comparisons that set the principal object in a strong point of view, or that embellish and diversify the narration. In general, when by any animating passion, whether pleasant or painful, an impulse is given to the imagination; we are in that condition wonderfully disposed to every sort of figu-rative expression, and in particular to com-parisons."
"wife, the Grecians got liberty to breathe, and even to press upon the Trojans. It being thus the nature of an episode to break the unity of action, it ought never to be indulged unless to refresh and unbend the mind after the fatigue of a long narra  This purpose of an episode demands the following properties. It ought to be well connected with the principal action: it ought to be short: and it ought to be lively and interesting."
"            Next, upon the peculiarities of a dramatic poem. And the first I shall mention is a double plot; being naturally led to it by what is said immediately above. One of these double plots must be of the nature of an episode in an epic poem; for it would distract the spectator, instead of entertain him, if he were forced to attend, at the same time, to two capital plots equally in-teresting. An under-plot in a tragedy has seldom a good effect; because a passionate piece cannot be too simple. The sympa-thetic emotions once roused, cling to their objects, and cannot bear interruption:"
"when a subject fills the mind, it leaves no room for any separate concernRacine, in his preface to the tragedy of Berenice, is sensible, that simplicity is a great beauty in tragedy, but mis-takes the cause. Nothing (says he) but verisimilitude plea-ses in tragedy: but where is the verisimilitude, that within the compass of a day, events should be crowded which commonly are extended through months? This is mista-king the accuracy of imitation for the probability or improba-bility of future events. I explain myself. The verisimilitude required in tragedy, is that the actions correspond to the manners, and the manners to nature. When this resemblance is preserved, the imitation is just, because it is a true copy of nature. But I deny that the verisimilitude of future events, meaning the probability of future events, is any rule in tra-gedy. A number of extraordinary events, are, it is true, seldom crowded within the compass of a day: but what sel-dom happens may happen; and when such events fall out, they appear not less natural than the most ordinary accidents. To make verisimilitude in the sense of probability a governing rule in tragedy, would annihilate this sort of writing altoge-ther; for it would exclude all extraordinary events, in which the life of tragedy consists. It is very improbable or unlikely, pitching upon any man at random, that he will sacrifice his life and fortune for his mistress or for his country: yet when this event happens, supposing it agreeable to the character, we recognize the verisimilitude as to nature, whatever want of verisimilitude or of probability there was a priori that such would be the event.. Variety is more tolerable in comedy, which pretends only to amuse, without totally occupying"
"the mind. But even here, to make a dou-ble plot agreeable, a good deal of art is re-quisite. The under-plot ought not to vary greatly in its tone from that which is prin-cipal: passions may be varied, but discor-dant passions are unpleasant when jumbled together. This is a solid objection to tragi-comedy. For this reason, I blame the Provoked Husband: all the scenes that bring the family of the Wrongheads into action, being ludicrous and farcical, agree very ill with the sharpness and severity of the principal subject, exhibiting the discord between Lord Townly and his lady. The same objection touches not the double plot of the Careless Husband: the different subjects are sweetly connected; and have only so much variety as to resemble shades of colours harmoniously mixed. But this is not all. The under plot ought to be con-nected with the principal action, so as to employ the same persons: the intervals or pauses of the principal action ought to be filled with the under-plot; and both ought to be concluded together. This is the case of the Merry Wives of Windsor."

"Violent action ought to be excluded from the stage. While the dialogue runs on, a thousand particulars concur to delude us into an impression of reality; genuine sentiments, passionate language, and per-suasive gesture. The spectator once enga-ged, is willing to be deceived, loses sight of himself, and without scruple enjoys the spectacle as a reality. From this absent state, he is roused by violent action: he wakes as from a pleasing dream, and ga-thering his senses about him, finds all to be a fiction. Horace delivers the same rule; and founds it upon the reason given:"

"The French critics, as it appears to me, misapprehend the reason of this rule. Shed-ding blood upon the stage, say they, is barbarous and shocking to a polite au-dience. This no doubt is an additional reason for excluding bloodshed from the"
"French stage, supposing the French to be in reality so delicate. But this evidently is not the reason that weighed with the Greeks: that polite people had no notion of such delicacy; witness the murder of Cly-temnestra by her son Orestes, passing be-hind the scene, as represented by Sopho-cles. Her voice is heard calling out for mercy, bitter expostulations on his part, loud shrieks upon her being stabbed, and then a deep silence. I appeal to every per-son of feeling, whether this scene be not more horrible, than if the deed had been committed in sight of the spectators upon a sudden gust of passion. According to the foregoing reasoning of the French critics, there is nothing to exclude from the stage a duel occasioned by an affair of honour, because in it there is nothing barbarous or shocking to a polite audience: yet a scene of this nature is excluded from the French stage; which shows, without more argu-ment, that these critics have misapprehend the rule laid down by Horace. If Cor-neille, in representing the affair between Horatius and his sister, upon which murder"
"ensues behind the scene, had no other view than to remove from the spectators a scene of horror, he certainly was in a capital mistake: for murder in cold blood, which in some measure was the case as represented, is more horrible even where the conclusive stab is not seen, than the same act perform on the stage by violent and unpremedita-ted passion, as suddenly repented of as com-mitted. I heartily agree with AddisonSpectator, No. 44., that no part of this incident ought to have been represented, but reserved for a narra-tive, with all the alleviating circumstances possible in favour of the hero. This is the only method to avoid the difficulties that unqualify this incident for representation, a deliberate murder on the one hand, and on the other a violent action performed on the stage, which must rouse the spectator from his dream of reality."
"            I shall finish with a few words upon the dialogue; which ought to be so conducted as to be a true representation of nature. I"
"talk not here of the sentiments, nor of the language; for these come under different heads. I talk of what properly belongs to dialogue-writing; where every single speech, short or long, ought to arise from what is said by the former speaker, and furnish matter for what comes after, till the end of the scene. In this view, the whole speeches, from first to last, represent so many links, all connected together in one regular chain. No author, ancient or modern, possesses the art of dialogue equal to Shakespear. Dry-den, in this particular, may justly be pla-ced as his opposite. He frequently intro-duces three or four persons speaking upon the same subject, each throwing out his own sentiments separately, without regard what is said by the rest. I give for an ex-ample the first scene of Aurenzebe. Some-times he makes a number club in relating an event, not to a stranger, supposed igno-rant of it, but to one another, for the sake merely of speaking. Of this notable sort of dialogue, we have a specimen in the first scene of the first part of the Conquest of Gra-nada. In the second part of the same tragedy,"
"'scene second, the King, Abenamar, and Zulema, make their separate observations, like so many soliloquies, upon the fluctua-ting temper of the mob. It puts one in mind of a pastoral, where two shepherds are introduced reciting couplets alternately, each in praise of his own mistress, as if they were contending for a prize."
"            The bandying sentiments in this manner, beside an unnatural air, has another bad ef-fect. It stays the course of the action, be-cause it is not productive of any consequence. In Congreve comedies, the action is often suspended to make way for a play of wit. But of this more particularly in the chapter immediately following."

"            THE first chapter unfolds the plea-sure we have in a chain of connect facts. In histories of the world, of a country, of a people, this pleasure is but faint; because the connections are slight or obscure. We find more entertainment in biography, where the incidents are con-nected by their relation to one person, who makes a figure and commands our atten  But the greatest entertainment of the kind, is afforded by the history of a single vent, supposing it to be interesting. The history of one event produceth a more en-tire connection among the parts, than the history of one person. In the latter, the circumstances are not otherwise connected than by their relation to that person: in the"
"former, the circumstances are connected by the strongest of all relations, that of cause and effect. Thus, the circumstances of a single event, having a mutual connection extremely intimate, form a delightful train: we survey with peculiar pleasure a number of facts that give birth to each other; and we pass with ease and satisfaction from the first to the last."
"            But this subject merits a more particular discussion. When we consider the chain of causes and effects in the material world, independent of purpose, design, or thought, we find a train of incidents in succession, without beginning, middle, or end. Every thing that happens is both a cause and an effect: it is the effect of something that goes before, and the cause of one or many things that follow. One incident may af-fect us more, another less; but all of them, great and small, are so many links in the universal chain. The mind, in viewing these incidents, cannot rest or settle ulti-mately upon any one; but is carried along in the train without any close."

"But when the intellectual world is taken under view, in conjunction with the mate-rial, the scene is varied. Man acts with deliberation, will, and choice; he acts with a view to some end, glory, for example, or riches, or conquest, the procuring happi-ness to individuals, or to his country in general; and he proposes means and lays schemes to attain the end proposed. Here is recognised a capital end or event, con-nected with subordinate events or incidents by the relation of causation. In running ver a series of subordinate events, we cannot rest upon any one; because they are presented to us as means only, leading to some end. But we rest with satisfaction upon the ulti-mate event; because there, the purpose, the plan, the aim, of the chief person or persons, is completed and brought to a final conclu-sion. This indicates a beginning, a middle, and an end, of what Aristotle calls an entire action"
"               Poet. cap 6. See also cap. 7.. The story naturally begins with describing those circumstances which move the distinguished person to form a plan, in"
"order to compass some desired event. The prosecution of that plan, and the obstruc-tions, carry the reader into the heat of ac  The middle is properly where the action is the most involved; and the end is where the event is brought about, and the design accomplished."
"            A design or plan thus happily perfected, after many obstructions, affords wonderful delight to the reader. And to produce this delight, a principle mentioned aboveChap. 8. mainly contributes; a principle that disposes the mind to complete every work commen-ced, and in general to carry every thing to its ultimate conclusion."
"            I have given the foregoing example of a plan laid down and completed, because it affords the clearest conception of a begin-ning, a middle, and an end, in which con-sists unity of action: and indeed stricter nity cannot be imagined than in this case. But an action may have unity, or a begin-ning, middle, and end, without so inti-mate a relation of parts. The catastrophe"
"may be different from what is intended or desired; which is frequently the case in our best tragedies. The Aeneid is an instance of means employed to produce a certain vent, and these means crowned with suc-cess. The Iliad is formed upon a different model. It begins with the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon: it goes on to describe the several effects produced by that cause; and ends in a reconciliation. Here is unity of action, no doubt, a begin-ning, a middle, and an end: it must however be acknowledged, that the Aeneid is more happy in point of connection. The mind hath a propensity to go forward in the chain of history: it keeps always in view the expected event; and when the inci-dents or under-parts are connected together by their relation to the event, the mind runs sweetly and easily along them. This pleasure we have in the Aeneid. But it is not altogether so pleasant, as in the Iliad, to connect effects by their common cause; for such connection forces the mind to a conti-nual retrospect: looking backward is like walking backward."
"            "
"               "
"But Homer plan is still more imperfect, for another reason, That the events descri-bed are but imperfectly connected with the wrath of Achilles as their cause. His wrath did not exert itself in action; and the mis-fortunes of his countrymen were but nega-tively the effects of his wrath, by depri-ving them of his assistance."
"            If unity of action be a capital beauty in a fable imitative of human affairs, a double action must be a capital defect, by carrying on together two trains of unconnected ob-jects. For the sake of variety, we indulge an under-plot that contributes to the prin-cipal event. But two unconnected events are a great deformity; and it lessens the formity but a very little, to engage the same actors in both. Ariosto is quite li-centious in this particular: he carries on at the same time a plurality of unconnected stories. His only excuse is, that his plan is perfectly well adjusted to his subject; for every thing in the Orlando Furioso is wild and extravagant."
"            To state facts according to the order of time, is the most natural and the most"
"'simple method: a method however not so essential, in an historical fable especially, as not to yield to some conspicuous beautiesSee  1.. If a noted story, cold and simple in its first movements, be made the subject of an epic poem, the reader may be hurried into the heat of action, reserving the preliminaries for a conversation-piece, if it shall be thought necessary. This method, at the same time, being dramatic, hath a peculiar beauty, which narration cannot reachSee  21.. Ro-mance-writers, who give little attention to nature, deviate in this particular, among many, from a just standard. They make no difficulty of presenting to the reader, without the least preparation, unknown persons engaged in some adventure equally unknown. In Cassandra, two personages, who afterward are discovered to be the he-roes of the story, start up completely armed upon the banks of the Euphrates, and en-gage in a single combatI am sensible that a commencement of this sort is much relished by certain readers disposed to wonder. Their curio-sity is raised, and they are much tickled in its gratification. But curiosity is at an end with the first reading, because the personages are no longer unknown; and therefore at the se-cond reading a commencement so artificial, loses all its power even over the vulgar. A writer of genius loves to deal in last beauties.."

"A play analyzed, is a chain of connected facts, of which each scene makes a link. Each scene, accordingly, ought to produce some incident relative to the catastrophe or ultimate event, by advancing or retarding it. If no incident be produced, such a scene, which may be termed barren, ought not to be indulged, because it breaks the nity of action. A barren scene can never be intitled to a place, because the chain is complete without it. In the Old Bachelor, the 3d scene of act 2. and all that fol-low to the end of that act, are mere con-versation-pieces, without any consequence. The 10th and 11th scenes, act 3. Double Dealer, the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th scenes, act 1. Love for Love, are of the same kind. Neither is The Way of the World entirely guiltless of such scenes. It will be no justification, that they help to display characters. It were better, like"
"Dryden, in his dramatis personae, to scribe characters beforehand, which would not interrupt the chain of action. But a writer of genius has no occasion for such ar-tifice: he can display the characters of his personages much more to the life in senti-ment and action. How successfully is this done by Shakespear! in whose works there is not to be found a single barren scene."
"            Upon the whole, it appears, that all the facts in an historical fable, ought to have a mutual connection by their common rela to the grand event or catastrophe. And this relation, in which the unity of action consists, is equally essential to epic and dra-matic compositions."
"            How far the unities of time and of place are essential, is a question of greater intricacy. These unities were strictly observed in the Grecian and Roman theatres; and they are inculcated by the French and English cri-tics as essential to every dramatic composi  In theory, these unities are also ac-knowledged by our best poets, though their practice is seldom correspondent: they are often forced to take liberties, which they"
"pretend not to justify, against the practice of the Greeks and Romans, and against the solemn decision of their own countrymen. But in the course of this inquiry it will be made evident, that the example of the ancients ought, upon this point, to have no weight with us, and that our critics are guilty of a mistake, in admitting no greater latitude of place and time than was admitted in Greece and Rome."
"            Suffer me only to premise, that the uni-ties of place and time, are not, by the most rigid critics, required in a narrative poem. In such a composition, if it pretend to copy nature, these unities would be absurd; be-cause real events are seldom confined within narrow limits either of place or of time. And yet we can follow history, or an historical fable, through all its changes, with the greatest facility. We never once think of measuring the real time by what is taken in reading; nor of forming any connection between the place of action and that which we occupy."
"            I am sensible, that the drama differs so far from the epic, as to admit different rules."
"It will be observed, That an historical fable, which affords entertainment by reading solely, is under no limitation of time or of place, more than a genuine history; but that a dramatic composi cannot be accurately represented, un-less it be limited, as its representation is, to one place and to a few hours; and therefore that no fable can be admitted but what has these properties, because it would be absurd to compose a piece for representation that cannot be justly re-presented. This argument, I acknow-ledge, has at least a plausible appearance; and yet one is apt to suspect some fallacy, considering that no critic, however strict, has ventured to confine the unities of place and of time within so narrow boundsBossu, after observing, with wonderful critical sagacity, that winter is an improper season for an epic poem, and night not less improper for tragedy; admits however, that an epic poem may be spread through the whole summer months, and a tragedy through the whole sun-shine hours of the longest summer-day.

"A view of the Grecian drama, and a comparison between it and our own, may perhaps help to relieve us from this dilem-ma. If they be differently constructed, as shall by and by be made evident, it is pos-sible that the foregoing reasoning may not be applicable with equal force to both. This is an article, that, with relation to the present subject, has not, so far as I know, been examined by any writer."
"            All authors agree, that the first notion of tragedy in Greece, was derived from the hymns in praise of Bacchus, which were sung in parts by a chorus. Thespis, to relieve the singers, and for the sake of va-riety, introduced one actor; who gave a narrative of the subject, and sometimes re-presented one or other personage. Eschy-lus, introducing a second actor, formed the dialogue; by which the performance became dramatic: and the actors were multiplied when the subject represented made it ne-cessary. But still, the chorus, which gave a beginning to tragedy, was considered as an essential part of its constitution. In the first scene, generally, are unfolded the pre-liminary"

"circumstances that lead to the grand event. This scene is by Aristotle termed the prologue. In the second scene, where the action properly begins, the cho-rus is introduced, which, as originally, con-tinues upon the stage during the whole performance. Sophocles adheres to this plan religiously. Euripides is not altoge-ther so correct. In some of his pieces it becomes necessary to remove the chorus. But this is seldom done; and when done, matters are so ordered as that their absence is but momentary. The chorus often mix in the dialogue; and when the dialogue happens to be suspended, the chorus, du-ring the interval, is employed in singing. Nor does the removal of the chorus, when that unusual step is risked, interrupt the representation. They never leave the stage of their own accord, but at the command of some principal personage who constantly waits their return."
"            Thus the Grecian drama is a continued representation without any interruption; a circumstance that merits attention. A con-tinued representation without a pause, af-fords"
"not opportunity to vary the place of action; and has withal a very short dura  To a representation so confined in place and time, the foregoing reasoning is strictly applicable. A real or feigned ac that is brought to a conclusion after considerable intervals of time and frequent change of place, cannot accurately be co-pied in a representation that admits of no latitude in either. Hence it is, that the nities of place and of time, were, or ought to have been, strictly observed in the Grecian tragedies. This is made necessary by the very constitution of their drama; for it is absurd to compose a tragedy that cannot be justly represented."
"            Modern critics, who for our drama pretend to establish rules founded on the practice of the Greeks, are guilty of an egregious blunder. The unities of place and of time, so much vaunted, were in Greece, as we see, a matter of necessity, not of choice. I am now ready to show, that if we submit to these fetters, it must be from choice not necessity. This will be evident upon taking a view of the construc-tion"
"of our drama, which differs widely from that of Greece; whether more or less perfect, is a separate question, which shall be handled afterward. By dropping the chorus, an opportunity is afforded to split our drama into parts or acts, which in the representation are distinguished by intervals of time; and during these in-tervals, the stage is totally evacuated and the spectacle suspended. This construction qualifies our drama for subjects spread through a wide space both of time and of place. The time supposed to pass during the suspension of the representation, is not measured by the time of the suspension; nor is any connection formed, between the box we sit in and the place where things are sup-posed to be transacted in our absence: and by that means, many subjects can be justly represented in our theatres, for which there was no place in those of ancient Greece. This doctrine may be illustrated, by compa-ring a modern play to a set of historical pic-tures: let us suppose them five in number, and the resemblance will be complete. Each of the pictures resembles an act in one"
"of our plays. There must necessarily be the strictest unity of place and of time in each picture; and the same necessity requires these two unities during each act of a play, because during an act there is no interruption in the spectacle. Now, when we view in succession a number of such historical pic-tures, let it be, for example, the history of Alexander by Le Brun, we have no diffi-culty to conceive, that months or years have passed between the subjects exhibited in two different pictures, though the interrup is imperceptible in passing our eye from the one to the other. We have as little difficulty to conceive a change of place, however great. In this matter, there is truly no difference between five acts of a modern play and five such pictures. Where the representation is suspended, we can with the greatest facility suppose any length of time or any change of place. The specta-tor, it is true, may be conscious, that the real time and place are not the same with what are employed in the representation, even including the intervals. But this is a work of reflection; and by the same reflec-tion"
"he may also be conscious, that Garrick is not King Lear, that the playhouse is not Dover cliffs, nor the noise he hears thunder and lightning. In a word, during an inter-ruption of the representation, it is not more difficult for a spectator to imagine himself carried from place to place, and from one period of time to another, than at once, when the scene first opens, to be carried from London to Rome, or from the pre-sent time two thousand years back. And indeed, it must appear ridiculous, that a critic, who makes no difficulty of supposing candle-light to be sun-shine, and some painted canvasses a palace or a prison, should affect so much difficulty in imagining a latitude of place or of time in the story, beyond what is necessary in the representa "
"            There are, I acknowledge, some ef-fects of great latitude in time that ought never to be indulged in a composition for the theatre. Nothing can be more absurd, than at the close to exhibit a full grown person who appears a child at the beginning. The mind rejects as contrary to all proba-bility,"
"'such latitude of time as is requisite for a change so remarkable. The greatest change from place to place hath not altoge-ther the same bad effect. In the bulk of human affairs place is not material; and the mind, when occupied with an interesting event, is little regardful of minute circum-stances. These may be varied at will, be-cause they scarce make any impression."
"            But though I have thus taken arms to rescue modern poets from the slavish fetters of modern critics, I would not be under-stood to justify liberty without any reserve. An unbounded licence with relation to place and time, is faulty for a reason that seems to have been overlooked: it never fails to break in upon the unity of action. In the ordinary course of human affairs, single vents, such as are fit to be represented on the stage, are confined to a narrow spot, and generally employ no great extent of time. We accordingly seldom find strict unity of action in a dramatic composition, where any remarkable latitude is indulged in these particulars. I must say farther, that a composition which employs but one"
"place, and requires not a greater length of time than is necessary for the representa  is so far the more perfect: because the confining an event within so narrow bounds, contributes to the unity of action; and also prevents that labour, however slight, which the mind must undergo in imagining fre-quent changes of place and many intervals of time. But still I must insist, that the li-mitation of place and time which was ne-cessary in the Grecian drama, is no rule to us; and therefore that though such limita adds one beauty more to the composi  it is at best but a refinement, which may justly give place to a thousand beau-ties more substantial. And I may add, that it is extremely difficult, I was about to say impracticable, to contract within the Gre-cian limits, any fable so fruitful of incidents in number and variety as to give full scope to the fluctuation of passion."
"            It may now appear, that critics who put the unities of place and of time upon the same footing with the unity of action, ma-king them all equally essential, have not at-tended to the nature and construction of the"
"modern drama. If they admit an interrupt representation, with which no writer finds fault, it is plainly absurd to condemn the greatest advantage it procures us, that of representing many interesting subjects ex-cluded from the Grecian stage. If there needs must be a reformation, why not re-store the ancient chorus and the ancient continuity of action? There is certainly no medium: for to admit an interruption with-out relaxing from the strict unities of place and of time, is in effect to load us with all the inconveniencies of the ancient drama, and at the same time to with-hold from us its advantages."
"            And therefore the only proper question is, whether our model be or be not a real improvement. This indeed may justly be called in question; and in order to a fair comparative trial, some particulars must be premised. When a play begins, we have no difficulty to enter into the scene of ac  however distant it be in time or in place. We know that the play is a repre-sentation only: and the imagination, with facility, accommodates itself to every cir-cumstance. Our situation is very different"
"after we are engaged. It is the perfection of representation to hide itself, to impose upon the spectator, and to produce in him an impression of reality, as if he were spec-tator of a real eventChap. 2. part 1.  6.. Any interruption annihilates this impression: he is roused out of his waking dream, and unhappily resto-red to his senses. So difficult it is to support this impression of reality, that much slighter interruptions than the interval between two acts are sufficient to dissolve the charm. In the 5th act of the Mourning Bride, the three first scenes are in a room of state; the fourth in a prison. This change is operated by shifting the scene, which is done in a trice. But however quick the transition may be, it is impracticable to impose upon the spectators so far as to make them con-ceive that they are actually carried from the palace to the prison. They immediately re-flect, that the palace and prison are imagi-nary, and that the whole is a fiction."
"            From these premisses one will be natu-rally led, at first view, to declare against"
"the frequent interruptions in the modern drama. It will occur, That every inter-ruption must have the effect to banish the dream of reality, and with it to ba-nish our concern, which cannot subsist while we are conscious that all is a fic  and therefore that in the modern drama sufficient time is not afforded for the fluctuation and swelling of passion, like what is afforded in the Grecian dra-ma, where there is no interruption. This reasoning, it must be owned, has a specious appearance: but we must not turn faint-hearted upon the first repulse; let us rally our troops for a second engage-ment."
"            Considering attentively the ancient dra-ma, we find, that though the representa is never interrupted, the principal ac is suspended not less frequently than in the modern drama. There are five acts in each; and the only difference is, that in the former, when the action is suspend  as it is at the end of every act, oppor-tunity is taken of the interval to employ the chorus in singing.

"Rooted grief, deep anguish, terror, remorse, despair, and all the severe dispiriting passions, are declared enemies, perhaps not to figura-tive language in general, but undoubtedly to the pomp and solemnity of comparison."
"the Grecian continuity of representation cannot have the effect to prolong the im-pression of reality. To banish this impres-sion, a suspension of the action while the chorus is employed in singing, is not less perative than a total suspension both of the representation and action."
"            But to open a larger view, I am ready to show, that a continued representation, with-out a single pause even in the principal ac  so far from an advantage, would be really an imperfection; and that a represen-tation with proper pauses, is better calcu-lated for moving the audience, and making the strongest impressions. Representation cannot very long support an impression of reality: when the spirits are exhausted by close attention and by the agitation of pas-sion, an uneasiness ensues, which never fails to banish the waking dream. Now suppo-sing an act to employ as much time as can easily be given with strict attention to any incident, a supposition that cannot be far from the truth; it follows, that the im-pression of reality would not be prolonged beyond the space of an act, even supposing"
"a continued representation. Hence it ap-pears, that a continued representation with-out any pause, would be a bad contrivance: it would break the attention by overstrain it, and produce a total absence of mind. In this respect, the four pauses have a fine effect. By affording to the audience a sea-sonable respite when the impression of rea-lity is gone, and while nothing material is in agitation, they relieve the mind from its fatigue; and consequently prevent a wan-dering of thought at the very time possibly of the most interesting scenes."
"            In one article indeed, the Grecian model has greatly the advantage: its chorus, du-ring an interval, not only preserves alive the impressions made upon the audience, but also prepares their hearts finely for new im-pressions. In our theatres, on the contra-ry, the audience, at the end of every act, are in a manner solicited to withdraw their thoughts from what has been passing, and to trifle away the time the best way they can. Thus in the intervals between the acts, every warm impression is banished; and the spectators begin the next act cool and in-different,"
"as at the commencement of the play. Here is a gross malady in our thea-trical representations; but a malady that luckily is not incurable. To revive the Grecian chorus, would be to revive the Grecian slavery of place and time. But I can figure a detached chorus coinciding with a pause in the representation, as the ancient chorus did with a pause in the principal ac  What objection, for example, can there lie against music between the acts, vo-cal and instrumental, adapted to the sub-ject? Such detached chorus, beside admit-ting the same latitude that we enjoy at present as to time and place, would have more than one happy effect: it would re-cruit the spirits; and it would preserve en-tire, the tone, if not the tide, of passion. The music that comes first, ought to accord with the tone of the preceding passion, and be gradually varied till it accord with the tone of the passion that is to succeed in the next act. The music and the represen-tation would both of them be gainers by their conjunction; which will thus appear. Music that accords with the present tone"
"of mind, is, upon that account, doubly a-greeable; and accordingly, though music singly hath not power to raise any passion, it tends greatly to support a passion already raised. Further, music, though it cannot of itself raise a passion, prepares us for the passion that follows: by making chearful, tender, melancholy, or animated impres-sions, music has power to dispose the heart to various passions. Of this power, the first scene of the Mourning Bride is a shi-ning instance: without the preparation of soft music in a melancholy strain, it would be extremely difficult to enter all at once into Almeria deep distress. In this man-ner, music and representation support each other delightfully: the impression made upon the audience by the representation, is a fine preparation for the music that succeeds; and the impression made by the music, is a fine preparation for the representation that suc-ceeds. It appears to me clear, that, by some such contrivance, the modern drama may be improved, so as to enjoy the advantage of the ancient chorus without its slavish li-mitation of place and time. And as to"
"music in particular, I cannot figure any plan that would tend more to its improve-ment. Composers, those for the stage at least, would be reduced to the happy ne-cessity of studying and imitating nature; instead of indulging, according to the pre-sent fashion, in wild, fantastic, and unna-tural conceits. But we must return to our subject, and finish the comparison between the ancient and the modern drama."
"            The numberless improprieties forced upon the Grecian dramatic poets by the constitution of their drama, are, of them-selves one should think, a sufficient reason for preferring that of the moderns, even abstracting from the improvement proposed. To prepare the reader for this article, it must be premised, that as in the ancient drama the place of action never varies, a place necessarily must be chosen to which every person may have access without any improbability. This confines the scene to some open place, generally the court or area before a palace; which excludes from the Grecian theatre transactions within doors, though these commonly are the most"
"important. Such cruel restraint is of itself sufficient to cramp the most pregnant inven  and accordingly the Grecian writers, in order to preserve unity of place, are re-duced to woful improprieties. In the Hippolytus of EuripidesAct 1. sc. 6., Phedra, di-stressed in mind and body, is carried with-out any pretext from her palace to the place of action, is there laid upon a couch un-able to support herself upon her limbs, and made to utter many things improper to be heard by a number of women who form the chorus. What is still worse, her female at-tendant uses the strongest intreaties to make her reveal the secret cause of her anguish; which at last Phedra, contrary to decency and probability, is prevailed upon to do in presence of this very chorusAct 2. sc. 2.. Alcestes, in Euripides, at the point of death, is brought from the palace to the place of ac  groaning and lamenting her untimely fateAct 2. sc. 1.. In the Trachiniens of SophoclesAct 2., a secret is imparted to Dejanira, the wife"
"of Hercules, in presence of the chorus. In the tragedy of Iphigenia, the messenger em-ployed to carry Clitemnestra the news that Iphigenia was sacrificed, stops short at the place of action, and with a loud voice calls the Queen from her palace to hear the news. Again, in the Iphigenia in Tauris, the necessary presence of the chorus forces Euripides into a gross absurdity, which is to form a secret plot in their hearingAct 4. at the close.; and to disguise the absurdity, much courtship is bestowed on the chorus, not one woman but a number, to engage them to secrecy. In the Medea of Euripides, that princess makes no difficulty, in presence of the cho-rus, to plot the death of her husband, of his mistress, and of her father the King of Corinth, all by poison. It was necessary to bring Medea upon the stage, and there is but one place of action, which is always occupied by the chorus. This scene closes the second act; and in the end of the third, she frankly makes the chorus her confidents in ploting the murder of her own"
"children. Terence, by identity of place, is often forced to make a conversation within doors be heard on the open street: the cries of a woman in labour are there heard distinctly."
"            The Grecian poets are not more hap-py with respect to time than with re-spect to place. In the Hippolytus of Euri-pides, that prince is banished at the end of the fourth act. In the first scene of the following act, a messenger relates to Theseus the whole particulars of the death of Hippolytus by the sea-monster. This remarkable event must have employed ma-ny hours; and yet in the representation it is confined to the time employed by the chorus upon the song at the end of the 4th act. The inconsistency is still greater in the Iphigenia in Tauris"
"               Act 5. sc. 4.. The song could not exhaust half an hour; and yet the in-cidents supposed to have happened in that time, could not naturally be transacted in less than half a day."
"            The Grecian artists are not less frequent-ly obliged to transgress another rule, derived"
"also from a continued representation, which is, that the place of action must constantly be occupied; for the very least vacuity is an interruption of the representation. Sophocles, with regard to this rule as well as others, is generally correct. But Euripides cannot bear such restraint: he often evacuates the stage, and leaves it empty for others in succession. Iphigenia in Tauris, after pronouncing a soliloquy in the first scene, leaves the place of action, and is succeeded by Orestes and Pylades. They, after some conversation, walk off; and Iphi-genia re-enters, accompanied with the cho-rus. In the Alcestes, which is of the same author, the place of action is void at the end of the third act. It is true, that to co-ver this irregularity, and to preserve the re-presentation in motion, Euripides is ex-tremely careful to fill the stage without loss of time. But this is still an interruption, and a link of the chain broken: for during the change of the actors, there must always be a space of time, when we cannot justly say, that the stage is occupied by either set. It makes indeed a more remarkable inter-ruption,"
"to change the place of action as well as the actors; but that was not practi-cable upon the Grecian stage."
"            It is hard to say upon what model Te-rence has formed his plays. Having no chorus, there is a cessation in the represen-tation at the end of every act. But advan-tage is not taken of this cessation, even to vary the place of action. The street is al-ways chosen, where every thing passing may be seen by every person: and by this choice, the most sprightly and interesting parts of the action, which commonly pass within doors, are excluded; witness the last act of the Eunuch. He hath submitted to the same slavery with respect to time. In a word, a play with a regular chorus, is not more confined in place and time than his plays are. Thus a zealous sectary follows implicitly ancient forms and ceremonies, without once considering whether their in-troductive cause be still subsisting. Plau-tus, of a bolder genius than Terence, makes good use of the liberty afforded by an interrupted representation: he varies the place of action upon all occasions, when the variation suits his purpose."

"The intelligent reader will by this time understand, that I plead for no change of place in our plays but after an interval, nor for any latitude in point of time but what falls in with an interval. The unities of place and time ought to be strictly observed during each act; for during the representa  there is no opportunity for the smallest deviation from either. Hence it is an es-sential requisite, that during an act the stage be always occupied; for even a mo-mentary vacuity makes an interval. An-other rule is not less essential: it would be a gross breach of the unity of action, to ex-hibit upon the stage two separate actions at the same time; and therefore to preserve this unity, it is necessary that each person-age introduced during an act, be linked to those in possession of the stage, so as to join all in one action. These things follow from the very conception of an act, which admits not the slightest interruption. The moment the representation is intermitted, there is an end of that act; and we have no other notion of a new act, but where after a pause or interval, the representation"
"is again put in motion. French writers, generally speaking, are extremely correct in this particular: the English, on the con-trary, are so irregular as scarce to deserve a criticism: actors not only succeed each ther in the same place without connection; but, what is still worse, they frequently succeed each other in different places. This change of place in the same act, ought ne-ver to be indulged; for, beside breaking the unity of the act, it has a disagreeable effect. After an interval, the mind can readily accommodate itself to any place that is necessary, just as readily as at the com-mencement of the play; but during the re-presentation, the mind rejects change of place. From the foregoing censure must be excepted the Mourning Bride of Con-greve, where regularity concurs with the beauty of sentiment and of language, to make it one of the most complete pieces England has to boast of I must acknowledge, how-ever, that in point of regularity, this ele-gant performance is not altogether unex-ceptionable. In the four first acts, the nities of place and time are strictly observed:"
"but in the last act, there is a capital error with respect to unity of place. In the three first scenes of that act, the place of action is a room of state, which is changed to a prison in the fourth scene: the chain of the actors withal is broken; for the persons in-troduced in the prison, are different from those who made their appearance in the room of state. This remarkable interrup of the representation, makes in effect two acts instead of one: and therefore, if it be a rule, that a play ought not to con-sist of more acts than five, this performance is so far defective in point of regularity. I may add, that even admitting six acts, the irregularity would not be altogether removed, without a longer pause in the re-presentation than is allowed in the acting; for it requires more than a momentary in-terruption, to enable the imagination rea-dily to accommodate itself to a new place, or to prorogation of time. In The Way of the World, of the same author, unity of place is preserved during every act, and a stricter unity of time during the whole play than is necessary."

"             XXIV. Gardening and Architecture."
"            THE books that have been composed upon architecture and upon embel-lishing ground, abound in practi-cal instruction necessary for a mechanic: but in vain would we rummage them for rational principles to improve our taste. In a general system, it might be thought suf-ficient to have unfolded the principles that govern these and other fine arts, leaving the application to the reader: but as I would neglect no opportunity of illustrating these principles, I propose to give a speci-men of their application to gardening and architecture, being favourite arts, though I profess no peculiar skill in either."
"            Gardening was at first an useful art: in the garden of Alcinoous, described by Ho-mer, we find nothing done for pleasure"
"merely. But gardening is now improved into a fine art; and when we talk of a gar-den without any epithet, a pleasure garden, by way of eminence, is understood. The garden of Alcinoous, in modern language, was but a kitchen-garden. Architecture has run the same course. It continued ma-ny ages an useful art merely, before it aspi-red to be classed with the fine arts. Archi-tecture therefore and gardening must be handled in a twofold view, as being useful arts as well as fine arts. The reader how-ever will not here expect rules for impro-ving any work of art in point of utility. It is no part of my plan to treat of any useful art as such. But there is a beauty in uti-lity; and in discoursing of beauty, that of tility ought not to be neglected. This leads us to consider gardens and buildings in differ-ent views: they may be destined for use solely, for beauty solely, or for both. Such variety in the destination, bestows upon gardening and architecture a great com-mand of beauties complex not less than va-rious, which makes it difficult to form an accurate taste in these arts. And hence"
"that difference and wavering of taste which is more remarkable here than in any art that has but a single destination."
"            Architecture and gardening cannot therwise entertain the mind, than by raising certain agreeable emotions or feelings; and before we descend to particulars, these arts shall be presented in a general view, by showing what are the emotions or feelings that can be raised by them. Poetry, as to its power of raising emotions, possesses justly the first place among the fine arts; for scarce one emotion of human nature is be-yond its reach. Painting and sculpture are more circumscribed, having the command of no emotions but what are produced by sight. They are peculiarly successful in expressing painful passions, which are dis-played by external signs extremely legibleSee  15.. Gardening, beside the emotions of beauty by means of regularity, order, proportion, colour, and utility, can raise emotions of grandeur, of sweetness, of gaiety, melan-choly, wildness, and even of surprise or"
"wonder. In architecture, regularity, or-der, and proportion, and the beauties that result from them, are still more conspicuous than in gardening. But with respect to the beauty of colour, architecture is far inferior. Grandeur can be expressed in a building, perhaps more successfully than in a garden; but as to the other emotions above men-tioned, architecture hitherto has not been brought to the perfection of expressing them distinctly. To balance this defect, archi-tecture can display the beauty of utility in the highest perfection."
"            But gardening possesses one advantage, which never can be equalled in the other art. A garden may be so contrived, as in various scenes to raise successively all its dif-ferent emotions. But to operate this deli-cious effect, the garden must be extensive, so as to admit a slow succession: for a small garden, comprehended at one view, ought to be confined to one expressionSee  8.: it may be gay, it may be sweet, it may be gloomy; but an attempt to mix these, would create"
"a jumble of emotions not a little unpleasant. For the same reason, a building, even the most magnificent, is necessarily confined to one expression."
"            Architecture, considered as a fine art, instead of rivaling gardening in its progress toward perfection, seems not far advanced beyond its infant-state. To bring it to ma-turity, two things mainly are wanted. First, A greater variety of parts and ornaments than it seems provided with. Gardening here has greatly the advantage: it is pro-vided with such plenty and such variety of materials, that it must be the fault of the artists, if the spectator be not entertained with different scenes, and affected with va-rious emotions. But materials in architec-ture are so scanty, that artists hitherto have not been successful in raising emotions, other than those of beauty and grandeur. With respect to the former, there are indeed plenty of means, regularity, order, symme-try, simplicity; and with respect to the lat-ter, the addition of size is sufficient. But though it be evident, that every building ought to have a certain character or expres-sion"
"'suitable to its destination; yet this is a refinement which artists have scarce ventu-red upon. A death head and bones em-ployed in monumental buildings, will in-deed produce an emotion of gloom and me-lancholy: but every ornament of this kind, if these can be termed so, ought to be re-jected, because they are in themselves disa-greeable. The other thing wanted to bring the art to perfection, is, to ascertain the pre-cise impression made by every single part and ornament, cupolas, spires, columns, carvings, statues, vases, &amp  For in vain will an artist attempt rules for employing these, either singly or in combination, un-til the different emotions or feelings they produce be distinctly explained. Garden in this particular hath also the advan-tage. The several emotions raised by trees, rivers, cascades, plains, eminences, and ther materials it employs, are understood; and the nature of each can be described with some degree of precision, which is done occasionally in the foregoing parts of this work."
"            "
"               "
"In gardening as well as in architecture, simplicity ought to be the governing taste. Profuse ornament hath no better effect than to confound the eye, and to prevent the object from making an impression as one entire whole. An artist destitute of genius for capital beauties, is naturally prompted to supply the defect by crowding his plan with slight embellishments. Hence in gar-dens, triumphal arches, Chinese houses, temples, obelisks, cascades, fountains, with-out end; and hence in buildings, pillars, vases, statues, and a profusion of carved work. Thus a woman who has no just taste, is apt to overcharge every part of her dress with ornament. Superfluity of deco-ration hath another bad effect: it gives the object a diminutive look. An island in a wide extended lake, makes it appear larger; but an artificial lake, which must always be little, appears still less by making an island in itSee appendix to part 5.  2.."
"            In forming plans for embellishing a field, an artist void of taste deals in straight lines,"
"resemblance or contrast: second, by set-ting an object in the strongest light: third, by associating an object with others that are agreeable: fourth, by elevating an object: and, fifth, by depressing it. And that comparisons may produce various pleasures by these different means, appears from what is said in the chapter above cited; and will be made still more evident by examples, which shall be given after premising some general observations."
"            An object of one sense cannot be compa-red to an object of another; for such ob-jects are totally separated from each other, and have no circumstance in common to admit either resemblance or contrast. Ob-jects of hearing may be compared, as also of taste, and of touch. But the chief fund of comparison are objects of sight; because, in writing or speaking, things can only be compared in idea, and the ideas of visible objects are by far more lively than those of any other sense."
"            It has no good effect to compare things by way of simile that are of the same kind, nor to contrast things of different kinds."

Nature in-deed, in organized bodies comprehended under one view, studies regularity; which, for the same reason, ought to be studied in architecture: but in large objects, which cannot otherwise be surveyed than in parts and by succession, regularity and uniformi-ty would be useless properties, because they cannot be discovered by the eyeA square field appears not such to the eye when viewed from any part of it; and the centre is the only place where a circular field preserves in appearance its real figure.. Na-ture therefore, in her large works, neglects these properties; and in copying nature the artist ought to neglect them."
"            Having thus far carried on a comparison between gardening and architecture, I pro-ceed to rules peculiar to each; and I begin"
"with gardening. The simplest idea of a garden, is that of a spot embellished with a number of natural objects, trees, walks, polished parterres, flowers, streams, &amp  One more complex comprehends statues and buildings, that nature and art may be mutually ornamental. A third approach nearer perfection, is of objects assem-bled together, in order to produce, not only an emotion of beauty, essential to gardens of every kind, but also some other particular emotion, grandeur, for example, gaiety, or any other of those above mentioned. The most perfect idea of a garden is an im-provement upon the third, requiring the adjustment of the several parts, in such a manner as to inspire all the different emo-tions that can be raised by gardening. In this idea of a garden, the arrangement is an important circumstance; for it has been shown, that some emotions figure best in conjunction, and that others ought always to appear in succession and never in con-junction. I have had occasion to observe aboveChap. 8., that when the most opposite emo-tions,"
"'such as gloominess and gaiety, still-ness and activity, follow each other in suc-cession, the pleasure on the whole will be the greatest; but that opposite or dissimilar emotions ought not to be united, because they produce an unpleasant mixtureChap. 2. part 4.. For that reason, a ruin, affording a sort of me-lancholy pleasure, ought not to be seen from a flower-parterre, which is gay and chear-ful. But to pass immediately from an exhilerating object to a ruin, has a glo-rious effect; for each of the emotions is the more sensibly felt by being contrasted with the other. Similar emotions, on the other hand, such as gaiety and sweetness, stillness and gloominess, motion and gran-deur, ought to be raised together; for their effects upon the mind are greatly heightened by their conjunctionSee the place immediately above cited.."
"            Kent method of embellishing a field, is admirable. It is painting a field with beautiful objects, natural and artificial, dis-posed like colours upon a canvas. It re-quires indeed more genius to paint in the"
"gardening way. In forming a landscape up-on a canvas, no more is required but to just the figures to each other: an artist who lays out ground in Kent manner, has an additional task, which is to adjust his figures to the several varieties of the field."
"            One garden must be distinguished from a plurality; and yet it is not obvious where-in the unity of a garden consists. A notion of unity is indeed suggested from viewing a garden surrounding a palace, with views from each window, and walks leading to every corner. But there may be a garden without a house. In this case, I must pro-nounce, that what makes it one garden, is the unity of design, every single spot ap-pearing part of a whole. The gardens of Versailles, properly expressed in the plural number, being no fewer than sixteen, are indeed all of them connected with the pa-lace, but have scarce any mutual connec  they appear not like parts of one whole, but rather like small gardens in contiguity. Were these gardens at some distance from each other, they would have a better effect. Their junction breeds con-fusion"
"of ideas, and upon the whole gives less pleasure than would be felt in a slower succession."
"            Regularity is required in that part of a garden which joins the dwelling-house; for being considered as a more immediate accessory, it ought to partake the regularity of the principal objectThe influence of this connection surpassing all bounds, is visible in many gardens, left in their original form of horizontal plains forced with great labour and ex-pence, perpendicular faces of earth supported with massy stone walls, terrace-walks in stages one above another, regular ponds and canals without the least motion, and the whole sur-rounded, like a prison, with high walls excluding every ex-ternal object. At first view it may puzzle one to account for a taste running cross to nature in every particular. But no-thing happens without a cause. Perfect regularity and uni-formity are required in a house; and this idea is extended to its accessory the garden, especially if it be a small spot inca-pable of grandeur or much variety. The house is regular, so must the garden be: the floors of the house are horizontal, and the garden must have the same position: in the house we are protected from every intruding eye, so must we be in the garden. This, it must be confessed, is carrying the notion of resemblance very far. But where reason and taste are laid asleep, nothing is more common than to carry resem-blance beyond proper bounds.. But in proportion to the distance from the house considered as"
"the centre, regularity ought less and less to be studied. In an extensive plan, it hath a fine effect to lead the mind insensibly from regularity to a bold variety giving an im-pression of grandeur. And grandeur ought to be studied as much as possible, even in a more confined plan, by avoiding a multipli-city of small partsSee  4.. Nothing contributes more to grandeur, than a right disposition of trees. Let them be scattered extremely thin near the dwelling-house, and thicken in proportion to their distance: distant eminences to be filled with trees, and laid open to view. A small garden, on the ther hand, which admits not grandeur, ought to be strictly regular."
"            Milton, describing the garden of Eden, prefers justly the grand taste to that of re-gularity."

"            In the manner of planting a wood or thicket, much art may be displayed. A common centre of walks, termed a star, from whence are seen a number of remark-able objects, appears too artificial to be a-greeable. The crowding withal so many objects together, lessens the pleasure that would be felt in a slower succession. A-bandoning therefore the star, being stiff and formal, let us try to substitute some form more natural, that will lay open all the remarkable objects in the neighbour-hood. This may be done by openings in the wood at various distances, which, in walking, bring successively under the eye every object as by accident. Some penings display single objects, some a plu-rality in a line, and some a rapid succession of them. In this plan, the mind at in-tervals is roused and cheared by agreeable objects; and the scene is greatly heightened by the surprise it occasions when we stumble,"
"as it were, upon objects of which we had no expectation."
"            As gardening is not an inventive art, but an imitation of nature, or rather nature it-self ornamented; it follows necessarily, that every thing unnatural ought to be rejected with disdain. Statues of wild beasts vomi-ting water, a common ornament in gardens, prevails in those of Versailles. Is this or-nament in a good taste? A jet eau, being purely artificial, may, without disgust, be tortured into a thousand shapes: but a re-presentation of what really exists in nature, admits not any unnatural circumstance. These statues therefore in the gardens of Versailles must be condemned: and yet so insensible has the artist been to just imita  as to have displayed his vicious taste without the least colour or disguise. A life-less statue of an animal pouring out water, may be endured without much disgust. But here the lions and wolves are put in violent action: each has seized its prey, a deer or a lamb, in act to devour. And yet, instead of extended claws and open mouth, the whole, as by a hocus-pocus trick, is con-verted"
"into a different scene: the lion, forgetting his prey, pours out water plenti-fully; and the deer, forgetting its danger, performs the same operation; a representa not less absurd than that in the opera, where Alexander the Great, after mounting the wall of a town besieged, turns about and entertains his army with a song."
"            In gardening, every lively exhibition of what is beautiful in nature has a fine ef-fect: on the other hand, distant and faint imitations are displeasing to every one of taste. The cutting evergreens in the shape of animals, is a very ancient prac-tice; as appears from the epistles of Pliny, who seems to be a great admirer of this puerile conceit. The propensity to imitation gave birth to this practice; and has supported it wonderfully long, consider how faint and insipid the imitation is. But the vulgar, great and small, devoid of taste, are entertained with the oddness and singularity of a resemblance, however di-stant, between a tree and an animal. An at-tempt, in the gardens of Versailles, to imi-tate"
"a grove of trees by a group of jets eau, appears, for the same reason, not less ridi-culous."
"            In laying out a garden, every thing tri-vial or whimsical ought to be avoided. Is a labyrinth then to be justified? It is a mere conceit, like that of composing verses in the shape of an axe or an egg. The walks and hedges may be agreeable; but in the form of a labyrinth, they serve to no end but to puzzle. A riddle is a con-ceit not so mean; because the solution is a proof of sagacity, which affords no aid in tracing a labyrinth."
"            The gardens of Versailles, executed with infinite expence by men at that time in high repute, are a lasting monument of a taste the most vicious and depraved. The faults above mentioned, instead of being a-voided, are chosen as beauties, and multi-plied without end. Nature, it would seem, was deemed too vulgar to be imitated in the works of a magnificent monarch; and for that reason preference was given to things unnatural, which probably were mistaken for supernatural.

"Queen Katharine, deserted by the King and in the deepest affliction upon her divorce, could not be disposed to any sallies of ima-gination: and for that reason, the fol-lowing"
"myself with a fanciful resemblance between these gardens and the Arabian tales. Each of them is a performance in-tended for the amusement of a great king: in the sixteen gardens of Versailles there is no unity of design, more than in the thou-sand and one Arabian tales: and, lastly, they are equally unnatural; groves of jets eau, statues of animals conversing in the manner of Aesop, water issuing out of the mouths of wild beasts, give an impression of fairy-land and witchcraft, not less than diamond-palaces, invisible rings, spells and incantations."
"            A straight road is the most agreeable, because it shortens the journey. But in an embellished field, a straight walk has an air of stiffness and confinement: and at any rate is less agreeable than a winding or wa-ving walk; for in surveying the beauties of a fine field, we love to roam from place to place at freedom. Winding walks have an-other advantage: at every step they open new views. In short, the walks in a field intended for entertainment, ought not to have any appearance of a road. My inten-tion"
"is not to make a journey, but to feast my eye with the beauties of art and nature. This rule excludes not long straight penings terminating upon distant objects. These, beside variety, never fail to raise an emotion of grandeur, by extending in ap-pearance the size of the field. An opening without a terminating object, soon closes upon the eye: but an object, at whatever distance, continues the opening; and deludes the spectator into a conviction, that the trees which confine the view are continued till they join the object. Straight walks also in recesses do extremely well: they vary the scenery, and are favourable to medita "
"            An avenue ought not to be directed in a straight line upon a dwelling-house: bet-ter far an oblique approach in a waving line, with single trees and other scattered objects interposed. In a direct approach, the first appearance continues the same to the end: we see a house at a distance, and we see it all along in the same spot without any variety. In an oblique approach, the intervening objects put the house seemingly"
"in motion: it moves with the passenger, and appears to direct its course so as hospi-tably to intercept him. An oblique ap-proach contributes also to variety: the house being seen successively in different direc-tions, takes on at every step a new figure."
"            A garden on a flat ought to be highly and variously ornamented, in order to occupy the mind and prevent its regretting the insi-pidity of an uniform plain. Artificial mounts in this view are common: but no person has thought of an artificial walk ele-vated high above the plain. Such a walk is airy, and tends to elevate the mind: it extends and varies the prospect: and it makes the plain, seen from a height, ap-pear more agreeable."
"            Whether should a ruin be in the Gothic or Grecian form? In the former, I say; because it exhibits the triumph of time over strength, a melancholy but not unpleasant thought. A Grecian ruin suggests rather the triumph of barbarity over taste, a gloo-my and discouraging thought."
"            Fountains are seldom in a good taste. Statues of animals vomiting water, which"
"prevail every where, stand condemned. A statue of a whale spouting water upward from its head, would in one sense be natu-ral, as whales of a certain species have that power. The design however would scarce be relished, because its singularity would give it the appearance of being un-natural. There is another reason against it, that the figure of a whale is in itself not a-greeable. In the many fountains in and about Rome, statues of fishes are frequently employed to support a large basin of water. This unnatural conceit cannot be otherwise explained, than by the connection between water and the fish that swim in it; which by the way is a proof of the influence that even the slighter connections have on the mind. The only good design for a foun-tain I have met with, is what follows. In an artificial rock, rugged and abrupt, there is a cavity out of sight at the top: the wa-ter, conveyed to it by a pipe, pours or trickles down the broken parts of the rock, and is collected into a basin at the foot: it is so contrived, as to make the water fall in sheets or in rills at pleasure."

"Hitherto a garden has been treated as a work intended solely for pleasure, or, in ther words, for giving impressions of intrin-sic beauty. What comes next in order is the beauty of a garden destined for use, termed relative beauty"
"               See these terms defined,  3.; and this branch shall be dispatched in a few words. In gar-dening, luckily, relative beauty need never stand in opposition to intrinsic beauty. All the ground that can be requisite for use, makes but a small proportion of an orna-mented field; and may be put in any corner without obstructing the disposition of the capital parts. At the same time, a kitchen-garden or an orchard is susceptible of intrin-sic beauty; and may be so artfully disposed among the other parts, as by variety and contrast to contribute to the beauty of the whole. In this respect, architecture is far more intricate, as will be seen immediately: for there, it being often requisite to blend intrinsic and relative beauty in the same building, it becomes a difficult task to at-tain both in any perfection."

"As gardening is brought to greater per-fection in China than in any other known country, an account of the means practised by Chinese artists to inspire all the various emotions of gardening, will be a fine illu-stration of the foregoing doctrine. In gene-ral, it is an indispensable law with them, never to deviate from nature: but in order to produce that degree of variety which is pleasing, every method is used that is consistent with nature. Nature is strictly imitated in the banks of their artificial lakes and rivers; which sometimes are bare and gravelly, sometimes covered with wood quite to the brink of the water. To flat spots adorned with flowers and shrubs, are opposed others steep and rocky. We see meadows covered with cattle; rice-grounds that run into the lakes; groves into which enter navigable creeks and rivulets. These generally conduct to some interesting object, a magnificent building, terraces cut in a mountain, a cascade, a grotto, an artificial rock, and other such inventions. Their ar-tificial rivers are generally serpentine; some-times narrow, noisy, and rapid; sometimes"
"deep, broad, and slow: and to make the scene still more active, mills and other mo-ving machines are often erected. In the lakes are interspersed islands; some barren, surrounded with rocks and shoals; others inriched with every thing that art and na-ture can furnish. Even in their cascades they avoid regularity, as forcing nature out of its course: the waters are seen bursting out from among the caverns and windings of the artificial rocks; here an impetuous cataract, there many lesser falls: and in its passage, the water is often impeded by trees and heaps of stones, that seem brought down by the violence of the current. Straight lines, generally avoided, are some-times indulged, in order to take the advan-tage of any interesting object at a distance, by directing openings upon it."
"            Sensible of the influence of contrast, the Chinese artists deal in sudden transitions, and in opposing to each other, forms, co-lours, and shades. The eye is conducted, from limited to extensive views, and from lakes and rivers to plains, hills, and woods: to dark and gloomy colours, are opposed"
"the more brilliant: the different masses of light and shade are disposed in such a man-ner, as to render the composition distinct in its parts, and striking on the whole. In plantations, the trees are artfully mixed ac-cording to their shape and colour; those of spreading branches with the pyramidal, and the light with the deep green. They even introduce decayed trees, some erect, and some half out of the groundTaste has suggested to Kent the same artifice. The placing a decayed tree properly, contributes to contrast; and also produces a sort of pity, grounded on an imaginary personi-fication.. In order to heighten contrast, much bolder strokes are risked. They sometimes introduce rough rocks, dark caverns, trees ill formed and seemingly rent by tempests, or blasted by lightning, a building in ruins or half consumed by fire. But to relieve the mind from the harshness of such objects, they are always succeeded by the sweetest and most beautiful scenes."
"            The Chinese study to give play to the i-magination. They hide the termination of their lakes: the view of a cascade is fre-quently"
"interrupted by trees, through which are seen obscurely the waters as they fall. The imagination once roused, is disposed to magnify every object."
"            Nothing is more studied in Chinese gar-dens than to raise wonder or surprise. In scenes calculated for that end, every thing appears like fairy-land; a torrent, for ex-ample, conveyed under ground, producing an uncommon sound that puzzles a stranger to guess what it may be; and, to increase our wonder by multiplying such uncommon sounds, the rocks and buildings are contri-ved with cavities and interstices. Sometimes one is led insensibly into dark caverns, termi-nating unexpectedly in a landscape inriched with all that nature affords the most deli-cious. At other times, beautiful walks in-sensibly conduct us to a rough uncultivated field, where bushes briers and stones in-terrupt the passage: when we look about for an outlet, some rich prospect unexpect-edly opens to view. Another artifice is, to obscure some capital part by trees or other interposed objects: our curiosity is raised to know what lies beyond; and after a few"
"'steps, we are greatly surprised with some scene totally different from what was ex-pected."
"            I close these cursory observations up-on gardening, with a remark that must touch every reader. Rough uncultivated ground, dismal to the eye, inspires peevish-ness and discontent. May not this be one cause of the harsh manners of savages? In a field richly ornamented, are collected beautiful objects of various kinds. Such a field displays in full lustre, the goodness of the Deity and the ample provision he has made for our happiness; which must fill every spectator, with gratitude to his Maker and with benevolence to his fellow-creatures. Other fine arts may be perverted to excite irregular, and ven vicious, emotions: but gardening, which inspires the purest and most refined pleasures, cannot but promote every good affection. The gaiety and harmony of mind it produceth, must naturally incline the spectator to communicate his satisfac to others by acts of humanity and kindness."

"Having finished what occurred on gar-dening, I proceed to rules and observations that more peculiarly concern architecture. Architecture being an useful as well as a fine art, buildings and parts of buildings must be distinguished into three kinds, viz. what are intended for utility solely, what for or-nament solely, and what for both. A build intended for utility solely, such as tached offices, ought in every part to corre-spond precisely to that intention. The least deviation from use, though contributing to ornament, will be disagreeable. For every work of use being considered as a means to an end, its perfection as a means is the ca-pital circumstance; and every other beauty, in opposition, is neglected as improper and impertinent. In things again intended for ornament, such as pillars, obelisks, tri-umphal arches, beauty solely ought to be regarded. A Heathen temple must be con-sidered as merely ornamental; for being dedicated to some deity, and not intended for habitation, it is susceptible of any figure and any embellishment that fancy can sug-gest and beauty require. The great diffi-culty"
"of contrivance, respects buildings that are intended for pleasure as well as for use. These ends, employing different and often opposite means, are with difficulty reconci-led. In palaces, and other buildings suffi-ciently extensive to admit a variety of useful contrivance, regularity justly takes the lead. But in dwelling-houses that are too small for variety of contrivance, utility ought to prevail; neglecting regularity so far as it stands in opposition to convenience."
"            Intrinsic and relative beauty being found on different principles, must be handled separately; and I begin with relative beauty, as of the greater importance."
"            The proportions of a door, are determi-ned by the use to which it is destined. The door of a dwelling-house, which ought to correspond to the human size, is confined to seven or eight feet in height, and three or four in breadth. The proportions pro-per for the door of a barn or coach-house, are widely different. Another considera enters. To study intrinsic beauty in a coach-house or barn, intended merely for use, is obviously improper. But a dwell house"
"may admit ornaments; and the principal door of a palace demands all the grandeur that is consistent with the fore-going proportions dictated by utility. It ought to be elevated and approached by steps; and it may be adorned with pillars supporting an architrave, or in any other beautiful manner. The door of a church ought to be wide, in order to afford an easy passage for a multitude. The wideness, at the same time, regulates the height, as will appear by and by. The size of windows ought to be proportioned to that of the room they serve with light; for if the apperture be not sufficiently large to con-vey light to every corner, the room is dark and gloomy. Steps of stairs ought to be ac-commodated to the human figure, without regarding any other proportion: these steps accordingly are the same in large and in small buildings, because both are inhabited by men of the same size."
"            I proceed to consider intrinsic beauty blended with that which is relative. A cube in itself is more agreeable than a parallelo-pipedon, which will constantly hold in small"
"figures. But a large building in the form a cube, appears lumpish and heavy; while the other figure, set on its smaller base, is by its elevation more agreeable: and hence the beauty of a Gothic tower. But let us suppose this parallelopipedon destined for a dwelling-house, to make way for relative beauty. Here utility prevails over elevation; and a parallelopipedon, inconvenient by its height, is set upon its larger base. The loftiness is gone; but that loss is more than compensated by additional convenience; and for that reason the form of a building spread more upon the ground than raised in height, is always preferred for a dwelling-house, without excepting even the most sumptuous palace."
"            With respect to the divisions within, utility requires that the rooms be rectangular; for otherwise void spaces will be left of no use. A hexagonal figure leaves no void spa-ces; but then it determines the rooms to be all of one size, which is extremely incon-venient. A cube will at first be pronoun-ced the most agreeable figure; and this may hold in a room of a moderate size."
"But in a very large room, utility requires a different figure. The chief convenience of a great room, is unconfined motion. This directs us to the greatest length that can be obtained. But a square room of a great size is inconvenient, by removing far from the hand, chairs and tables, which, when unemployed, must be ranged along the sides of the room. Utility therefore requires a large room to be a parallelogram. This figure, at the same time, is the best calcu-lated for receiving light; because, to avoid cross-light, all the windows ought to be in one wall; and if the opposite wall be at such distance as not to be fully lighted, the room must be obscure. The height of a room exceeding nine or ten feet, has little or no relation to utility; and therefore pro-portion is the only rule for determining the height when above that number of feet."
"            As all artists who deal in the beautiful are naturally prone to entertain the eye, they have great opportunity to exert their taste upon palaces and sumptuous buildings, where, as above observed, intrinsic beauty ought to have the ascendant over that which"
"is relative. But such propensity is unhappy with respect to private dwelling-houses; be-cause in these, relative beauty cannot be dis-played in any perfection, without abandon intrinsic beauty. There is no opportu-nity for great variety of form in a small house; and in an edifice of this kind, inter-nal convenience has not hitherto been hap-pily adjusted to external regularity. I am apt to believe, that an accurate coincidence here, is beyond the reach of art. And yet architects always split upon this rock; for they never will give over attempting to re-concile these two incompatibles. How else should it be accounted for, that of the end-less variety of private dwelling-houses, there is not one to be found, that is generally a-greed upon as a good pattern? The un-wearied propensity to make a house regular as well as convenient, forces the architect, in some articles, to sacrifice convenience to regularity, and in others, regularity to con-venience. By this means, the house, which turns out neither regular nor convenient, never fails to displease. The faults are ob-vious,"
"and the difficulty of doing better is known to the artist only"

"            Nothing can be more evident, than that the form of a dwelling-house ought to be suited to the climate; and yet no error is more common, than to copy in Britain the form of Italian houses; not forgetting even those parts that are purposely contrived for air, and for excluding the sun. I shall give one or two instances. A colonnade along the front of a building, hath a fine effect in Greece and Italy, by producing coolness and obscurity, agreeable properties in warm and luminous climates. The cold climate of Britain is altogether averse to this ornament. A colonnade therefore, can never be proper in this country, unless when employed to communicate with a detached building. A-gain, a logio opening the house to the north, contrived in Italy for gathering cool air, is, if possible, still more improper for this cli-mate. Scarce endurable in summer, it, in"
"winter, exposes the house to the bitter blasts of the north, and to every shower of snow and rain."
"            Having discussed what appeared necessa-ry to be said upon relative beauty, singly considered, or in combination with intrinsic beauty, the next step is, to view architecture as one of the fine arts, and to examine those buildings and parts of buildings that are solely calculated to please the eye. In the works of nature, grand and magnificent, variety prevails. The timid hand of art, is guided by rule and compass. Hence it is, that in works which imitate nature, the great art is to hide every appearance of art; which is done by avoiding regularity and indulging variety. But in works of art that are ori-ginal and not imitative, such as architecture, strict regularity and uniformity ought to be studied so far as consistent with utility."
"            In buildings intended to please the eye, proportion is not less essential than regulari-ty and uniformity; for we are so framed by nature, as to be pleased equally with each of these. By many writers it is taken for granted, that in all the parts of a building"
"there are certain strict proportions which please the eye; precisely as there are certain strict proportions of sound which please the ear; and that in both the slightest deviation is equally disagreeable. Others again seem to relish more a comparison between propor in numbers and proportion in quantity; and hold that the same proportions are a-greeable in both. The proportions, for ex-ample, of the numbers 16, 24, and 36 are agreeable; and so, say they, are the pro-portions of a room, the height of which is 16 feet, the breadth 24, and the length 36. This point, with relation to the present sub-ject, being of importance, the reader will examine it with attention and impartiality. To refute the notion of a resemblance be-twixt musical proportions and those of ar-chitecture, it might be sufficient to observe in general, that the one is addressed to the ear, the other to the eye; and that objects of different senses have no resemblance, nor indeed any relation to each other. But more particularly, what pleases the ear in harmony, is not the proportion of the strings of the instrument, but of the sounds that"
"these strings produce. In architecture, on the contrary, it is the proportion of different quantities that pleases the eye, without the least relation to sound. Beside, were quan-tity here to be the sole ground of compari-son, we have no reason to presume, that there is any natural analogy between the proportions that please in a building and the proportions of strings that produce concor-dant sounds. I instance in particular an oc-tave, the most complete of all concords. An octave is produced by two strings of the same tension and diameter, and as to length in the proportion of one to two. I do not know, that this proportion will be agreeable in any two parts of a building. I add, that concordant notes are produced by wind in-struments, which, as to proportion, appear not to have even the slightest resemblance to a building."
"            With respect to the other notion institu-ting a comparison between proportion in numbers and proportion in quantity, I urge, that number and quantity are so distinct from each other, as to afford no probability of any natural relation between them. Quan-tity"
"rare even among good writers. To com-plete the present subject, it will be necessa-ry to make some observations upon such faulty comparisons. I begin with observing, that nothing can be more erroneous than to institute a comparison too faint: a distant resemblance or contrast, fatigues the mind with its obscurity instead of amusing it, and tends not to fulfil any one end of a com-parison. The following similes seem to bour under this defect:"

"is a real quality of every substance or body: number is not a real quality, but merely a conception that arises upon view a plurality of things in succession. Be-cause an arithmetical proportion is agreeable in numbers, have we any reason to conclude that it must also be agreeable in quantity? At this rate, a geometrical proportion and many others, ought also to be agreeable in both. A certain proportion may coincide in both; and among an endless variety of proportions, it would be wonderful, if there never should be a coincidence. One ex-ample is given of this coincidence, in the numbers 16, 24, and 36; but to be con-vinced that it is merely accidental, we need but reflect, that the same proportions are not applicable to the external figure of a house, and far less to a column."
"            That we are framed by nature to relish proportion as well as regularity, is indispu-table: but that agreeable proportion, like concord in sounds, is confined to certain precise measures, is not warranted by expe-rience: on the contrary, we learn from experience, that various proportions are qually"
"agreeable, that proportion is never tied down to precise measures but admits more and less, and that we are not sensible of disproportion till the difference between the quantities compared become the most striking circumstance. Columns evidently admit different proportions, equally agree-able. The case is the same in houses, rooms, and other parts of a building. And this opens an interesting reflection. The fore-going difference between concord and pro-portion, is an additional instance of that mirable harmony which subsists among the several branches of the human frame. The ear is an accurate judge of sounds and of their smallest differences; and that concord in sounds should be regulated by accurate measures, is perfectly well suited to this ac-curacy of perception. The eye is more un-certain about the size of a large object, than of one that is small; and in different situa-tions the same object appears of different si-zes. Delicacy of feeling therefore with re-spect to proportion in quantities, would be an useless quality. It is much better order  that there should be such a latitude with"
"respect to agreeable proportions, as to cor-respond to the uncertainty of the eye with respect to quantity."
"            But this scene is too interesting to be passed over in a cursory view: all its beauties are not yet displayed. I proceed to observe, that to make the eye as delicate with re-spect to proportion as the ear is with respect to concord, would not only be an useless quality, but be the source of continual pain and uneasiness. I need go no farther for a proof than the very room I possess at pre-sent: every step I take, varies to me, in appearance, the proportion of the length and breadth. At that rate, I should not be happy but in one precise spot, where the proportion appears agreeable. Let me fur-ther observe, that it would be singular in-deed, to find in the nature of man, any two principles in perpetual opposition to each other. This would precisely be the case, if proportion were circumscribed like concord; for it would exclude all but one of those proportions that utility requires in different buildings, and in different parts of the same building."
"            "
"               "
"It is ludicrous to observe all writers ac-knowledging the necessity of accurate pro-portions, and yet differing widely about them. Laying afide reasoning and philoso-phy, one fact universally agreed on ought to have undeceived them, that the same proportions which please in a model are not agreeable in a large building. A room 48 feet in length and 24 in breadth and height, is well proportioned; but a room 12 feet wide and high and 24 long, looks like a gallery."
"            Perrault, in his comparison of the ancients and modernsp. 94., is the only author who runs to the opposite extreme; maintaining, that the different proportions assigned to each order of columns are arbitrary, and that the beauty of these proportions is en-tirely the effect of custom. This bewrays ignorance of human nature, which evident-ly delights in proportion, as well as in regu-larity, order, and propriety. But without any acquaintance with human nature, a single reflection might have convinced him"
"of his error; that if these proportions had not originally been agreeable, they could not have been established by custom. If a thing be universal, it must be natural."
"            To illustrate the present point, I shall add a few examples of the agreeableness of dif-ferent proportions. In a sumptuous edifice, the capital rooms ought to be large, for therwise they will not be proportioned to the size of the building. On the other hand, a very large room in a small house, is dis-proportioned. But in things thus related, the mind requires not a precise or single pro-portion, rejecting all others; on the contra-ry, many different proportions are made qually welcome. It is only when a propor becomes loose and distant, that the a-greeableness abates, and at last vanisheth. In all buildings accordingly, we find rooms of different proportions equally agreeable, even where the proportion is not influenced by utility. With respect to the height of a room, the proportion it ought to bear to the length and breadth, is extremely arbitrary; and it cannot be otherwise, considering the uncertainty of the eye as to the height of a"
"room, when it exceeds 17 or 18 feet. In columns again, even architects must con-fess, that the proportion of height and thick-ness varies between 8 diameters and 10, and that every proportion between these two ex-tremes is agreeable. But this is not all. There must certainly be a further variation of proportion, depending on the size of the column. A row of columns 10 feet high, and a row twice that height, require differ-ent proportions. The intercolumniations must also differ in proportion according to the height of the row."
"            Proportion of parts is not only itself a beauty, but is inseparably connected with a beauty of the first magnitude. Parts that in conjunction appear proportional, never fail separately to produce similar emotions; which existing together, are extremely plea-sant, as I have had occasion to showChap. 2. part 4.. Thus a room of which the parts are all fine-ly adjusted to each other, strikes us with the beauty of proportion. It produceth at the same time a pleasure far superior. The"
"length, the breadth, the height, the win-dows, raise each of them separately an emo  These emotions are similar; and though faint when felt separately, they pro-duce in conjunction the emotion of concord or harmony, which is extremely pleasant. On the other hand, where the length of a room far exceeds the breadth, the mind comparing together parts so intimately con-nected, immediately perceives a disagree-ment or disproportion which disgusts. But this is not all. Viewing them separately, different emotions are produced, that of grandeur from the great length, and that of meanness or littleness from the small breadth, which in union are disagreeable by their discordance. Hence it is, that a long gallery, however convenient for exer-cise, is not an agreeable figure of a room. We consider it, like a stable, as destined for use, and expect not that in any other respect it should be agreeable."
"            Regularity and proportion are essential in buildings destined chiefly or solely to please the eye, because they are the means to pro-duce intrinsic beauty. But a skilful artist"
"will not confine his view to regularity and proportion. He will also study propriety, which is perceived when the form and or-naments of a structure are suited to the pur-pose for which it is appointed. The sense of propriety dictates the following rule, That every building ought to have an expression corresponding to its destination. A palace ought to be sumptuous and grand; a pri-vate dwelling, neat and modest; a play-house, gay and splendid; and a monument, gloomy and melancholy. A Heathen tem-ple has a double destination: it is considered chiefly as a house dedicated to some divini-ty; and in that respect it ought to be grand, elevated, and magnificent: it is considered also as a place of worship; and in that respect it ought to be somewhat dark or gloomy; because dimness produces that tone of mind which is suited to humility and devotion. A Christian church is not considered as a house for the Deity, but merely a place of worship: it ought therefore to be decent and plain, without much ornament: a si-tuation ought to be chosen, humble and retired; because the congregation, during"
"worship, ought to be humble and disenga-ged from the world. Columns, beside their chief destination of being supports, contribute to that peculiar expression which the destination of a building requires: co-lumns of different proportions, serve to ex-press loftiness, lightness, &amp  as well as strength. Situation also may contribute to expression: conveniency regulates the situ-ation of a private dwelling-house; but, as I have had occasion to observeChap. 10., the situation of a palace ought to be lofty."
"            And this leads me to examine, whether the situation of a great house, where the artist is limited in his choice, ought in any measure to regulate its form. The con-nection between a great house and the neigh-bouring grounds, though not extremely in-timate, demands however some congruity. It would, for instance, displease us to find an elegant building thrown away upon a wild uncultivated country: congruity requires a polished field for such a building; and be-side the pleasure of congruity, the spectator"
"is sensible of the pleasure of concordance from the similarity of the emotions produ-ced by the two objects. The old Gothic form of building seems well suited to the rough uncultivated regions where it was in-vented. The only mistake was, the trans-ferring this form to the fine plains of France and Italy, better fitted for buildings in the Grecian taste. But by refining upon the Gothic form, every thing in the power of invention has been done, to reconcile it to its new situation. The profuse variety of wild and grand objects about Inverary, manded a house in the Gothic form; and every one must approve the taste of the pro-prietor, in adjusting so finely, as he has done, the appearance of his house to that of the country where it is placed."
"            The external structure of a great house, leads naturally to its internal structure. A large and spacious room, receives us com-monly upon our entrance. This seems to me a bad contrivance in several respects. In the first place, when immediately from the open air we step into such a room, its size in appearance is diminished by contrast: it"

"room, all by a progression from small to great. If the house be very large, there may be space for the following suit of rooms; first, a portico; second, a passage within the house bounded by rows of co-lumns on each side connected by arcades; third, an octagon room, or of any other fi-gure, about the centre of the building; and, lastly, the great room."
"            Of all the emotions that can be raised by architecture, grandeur is that which has the greatest influence on the mind. It ought therefore to be the chief study of the artist, to raise this emotion in great build-ings. But it seems unhappy for architecture, that it is necessarily governed by certain prin-ciples opposite to grandeur: the direct ef-fect of regularity and proportion, is to make a building appear less than it is in rea-lity. Any invention to reconcile these with grandeur, would be a capital improvement in architecture."
"            Next of ornaments, which contribute greatly to give buildings a peculiar expres-sion. It has been a doubt with me, whe-ther a building can regularly admit any or-nament"
"but what is useful, or at least appears to be useful. But considering the double aim of architecture, a fine as well as an useful art, there is no good reason why or-naments may not be added to please the eye without any relation to use. This li-berty is allowed in poetry, painting, and gardening, and why not in architecture con-sidered as a fine art? A private dwelling-house, it is true, and other edifices where use is the chief aim, admit not regularly any ornament but what has the appearance, at least, of use: but temples, triumphal arches, and other buildings intended chiefly or solely for show, may be highly orna-mented."
"            This suggests a division of ornaments in-to three kinds, viz. ornaments that are beautiful without relation to use, such as statues in niches, vases, basso or alto relievo: next, things in themselves not beautiful, but possessing the beauty of utility by impo-sing on the spectator, and appearing to be of use, blind windows for example: the third kind is, where the thing is in itself beautiful, and also takes on the appearance"
"of use; the case of a pilaster. With re-spect to the second, it is an egregious blun-der, to contrive the ornament so as to make it appear useless. If a blind window there-fore be necessary for regularity, it ought to be so disguised, as not to be distinguished from the real windows. If it appear to be a blind window, it is disgustful, as a vain at-tempt to supply the want of invention. It shows the irregularity in a stronger light; by signifying that a window ought to be there in point of regularity, but that the ar-chitect had not skill sufficient to connect external regularity with internal conve-nience."
"            From ornaments in general, we descend to a pillar, the chief ornament in great buildings. The destination of a pillar is to support, really or in appearance, another part termed the architrave. With respect to the form of this ornament, I observe, that a circle is a more agreeable figure than a square, a globe than a cube, and a cylin-der than a parallelopipedon. This last, in the language of architecture, is saying, that a column is a more agreeable figure than a"
"pilaster. For that reason, it ought to be preferred, all other circumstances being qual. Another reason concurs, that a co-lumn annexed to a wall, which is a plain surface, makes a greater variety than a pi-laster. There is an additional reason for re-jecting pilasters in the external front of a building, arising from a principle unfolded aboveChap. 8., viz. a remarkable tendency in the mind of man, to advance every thing to its perfection as well as to its final issue. If I see a thing obscurely in a dim light, and by disjointed parts, my curiosity is roused, and prompts me, out of the disjointed parts to compose an entire whole. I suppose it to be, for example, a horse. My eye-sight being obedient to this conjecture, I imme-diately perceive a horse, almost as distinctly as in day-light. This principle is applica-ble to the case in hand. The most superb front, at a great distance, appears a plain surface: approaching gradually, we be-gin to perceive inequalities: these inequa-lities, advancing a few steps more, take"
"on the appearance of pillars; but whether round or square, we are uncertain: our curiosity anticipating our progress, cannot rest in suspense: we naturally suppose the most complete pillar, or that which is the most agreeable to the eye; and we imme-diately perceive, or seem to perceive, a number of columns: if upon a near ap-proach we find pilasters only, the disap-pointment makes these pilasters appear disa-greeable; when abstracted from that cir-cumstance, they would only have appeared somewhat less agreeable. But as this ception cannot happen in the inner front inclosing a court, I see no reason for exclu-ding pilasters there, when there is any rea-son for preferring them before columns."
"            With respect now to the parts of a co-lumn, a bare uniform cylinder without base or capital, appears naked and scarce agree-able: it ought therefore to have some fi-nishing at the top and at the bottom. Hence the three chief parts of a column, the shaft, the base, and the capital. Nature undoubtedly requires a certain proportion a-mong these parts, but not limited within"
"precise bounds. I suspect that the propor-tions in use have been influenced in some degree by the human figure; the capital be conceived as the head, the base as the feet. With respect to the base indeed, the principle of utility interposes to vary it from the human figure: the base must be so proportioned to the whole, as to give the column the appearance of stability."
"            In architecture as well as in gardening, contradictory expressions ought to be avoid  Firmness and solidity are the proper expressions of a pedestal: carved work, on the contrary, ought to be light and deli-cate. A pedestal therefore, whether of a column or of a statue, ought to be sparingly ornamented: the ancients never ventured any bolder ornament than the basso-relievo."
"            To succeed in allegorical or emblematic ornaments, is no slight effort of genius; for it is extremely difficult to dispose them so in a building as to produce any good effect. The mixing them with realities, makes a mi-serable jumble of truth and fictionSee  20.  5.. In a"
"basso-relievo on Antonin pillar, rain ob-tained by the prayers of a Christian legion, is expressed by joining to the group of sol-diers a rainy Jupiter, with water in abun-dance running from his head and beard. Piles, fond of the conceit, carefully in-forms his reader, that he must not take this for a real Jupiter, but for a symbol which among the Pagans signified rain: an emblem ought not to make a part of the group representing real objects or real vents, but be detached from it, so as even at first view to appear an emblem. But this is not all, nor the chief point. Every emblem ought to be rejected that is not clearly expressive of its meaning: if it be in any degree obscure, it never can be re-lished. The temples of Ancient and Modern Virtue in the gardens of Stow, appear not at first view emblematical; and when we are informed that they are so, it is not easy to gather their meaning. The spectator sees one temple in full repair, another in ruins: but without an explanatory inscrip  he may guess, but cannot be certain, that the former being dedicated to Ancient"
"Virtue, the latter to Modern Virtue, are in-tended a satire upon the present times. On the other hand, a trite emblem, like a trite simile, is disgustfulSee  8.. Nor ought an emblem more than a simile to be founded on low or familiar objects; for if the objects be not agreeable, as well as their meaning, the emblem upon the whole will not be re-lished. A room in a dwelling-house con-taining a monument to a deceased friend, is dedicated to Melancholy. Its furniture is a clock that strikes every minute to sig-nify how swiftly time passes: upon the mo-nument, weeping figures and other hack-neyed ornaments commonly found upon tomb-stones, with a stuffed raven in a corner: verses on death, and other serious subjects, inscribed all around. The objects are too familiar, and the artifice too appa-rent, to produce the intended effect."
"            The statue of Moses striking a rock from which water actually issues, is also in a false taste; for it is mixing reality with re-presentation: Moses himself may bring"

"            It is observed above of gardening, that it contributes to rectitude of manners, by in-spiring gaiety and benevolence. I add an-other observation, That both gardening and architecture contribute to the same end, by inspiring neatness and elegance. It is observed in Scotland, that even a turnpike-road has some influence of this kind upon the low people in the neighbourhood. They acquire a taste for regularity and neat-ness; which is displayed first upon their yards and little inclosures, and next within doors. A taste for regularity and neatness thus gathering strength, comes insensibly to be extended to dress, and even to behaviour and manners."

"            The next error I shall mention is a capi-tal one.

"            "
"               THAT there is no disputing about taste, meaning taste in its most extensive sense, is a saying so ge-nerally received as to have become a proverb. One thing indeed is evident, that if the pro-verb hold true with respect to any one ex-ternal sense, it must hold true with respect to all. If the pleasures of the palate disdain a comparative trial and reject all criticism, the pleasures of touch, of smell, of sound, and even of sight, must be equally privile-ged. At this rate, a man is not within the reach of censure, even where, insensible to beauty, grandeur, or elegance, he prefers the Saracen head upon a sign-post before the best tablature of Raphael, or a rude Go-thic tower before the finest Grecian build  nor where he prefers the smell of a"
"rotten carcass before that of the most odori-ferous flower: nor jarring discords before the most exquisite harmony."
"            But we must not stop here. If the plea-sures of external sense be exempted from criticism, why not every one of our plea-sures, from whatever source derived? If taste in the proper sense of the word cannot be disputed, there is as little room for dis-puting it in its figurative sense. The pro-verb accordingly comprehends both; and in that large sense may be resolved into the following general proposition, That with re-spect to the sensitive part of our nature, by which some objects are agreeable some dis-agreeable, there is not such a thing as a good or bad, a right or wrong; that every man taste is to himself an ultimate standard with-out appeal; and consequently that there is no ground of censure against any one, if such a one there be, who prefers Black-more before Homer, selfishness before be-nevolence, or cowardice before magnanimi-ty."
"            The proverb in the foregoing instances, is indeed carried very far. It seems difficult,"
"however, to sap its foundation, or with suc-cess to attack it from any quarter. For in comparing the various tastes of individuals, it is not obvious what standard must be ap-pealed to. Is not every man equally a judge of what is agreeable or disagreeable to himself? Doth it not seem odd, and per-haps absurd, that a man ought not to be pleased when he is, or that he ought to be pleased when he is not?"
"            This reasoning may perplex, but, in con-tradiction to sense and feeling, will never afford conviction. A man of taste must ne-cessarily feel the reasoning to be false, how-ever unqualified to detect the fallacy. At the same time, though no man of taste will subscribe to the proverb as holding true in very case, no man will venture to affirm that it holds true in no case. Subjects there are undoubtedly, that we may like or dis-like indifferently, without any imputation upon our taste. Were a philosopher to make a scale for human pleasures with ma-ny divisions, in order that the value of each pleasure may be denoted by the place it oc-cupies, he would not think of making di-visions"

"without end, but would rank toge-ther many pleasures arising perhaps from dif-ferent objects, either as being equally va-luable, or differing so imperceptibly as to make a separation unnecessary. Nature hath taken this course, so far as appears to the generality of mankind. There may be subdivisions without end; but we are only sensible of the grosser divisions, comprehend each of them many pleasures of various kinds. To these the proverb is applicable in the strictest sense; for with respect to pleasures of the same rank, what ground can there be for preferring one before ano-ther? If a preference in fact be given by any individual, it cannot be taste, but cu-stom, imitation, or some peculiarity of mind."
"            Nature in her scale of pleasures, has been sparing of divisions: she hath wisely and benevolently filled every division with many pleasures; in order that individuals may be contented with their own lot, without en-vying the happiness of others: many hands must be employed to procure us the conve-niencies of life; and it is necessary that the"
"different branches of business, whether more or less agreeable, be filled with hands. A taste too nice and delicate, would obstruct this plan; for it would crowd some employ-ments, leaving others, not less useful, to-tally neglected. In our present condition, happy it is, that the plurality are not deli-cate in their choice. They fall in readily with the occupations, pleasures, food, and company, that fortune throws in their way; and if at first there be any displeasing cir-cumstance, custom soon makes it easy."
"            The proverb will be admitted so far as it regards the particulars now explained. But when applyed in general to every subject of taste, the difficulties to be encountered are insuperable. What shall we say, in parti-cular, as to the difficulty that arises from human nature itself? Do we not talk of a good and a bad taste? of a right and a wrong taste? and upon that supposition, do we not, with great confidence, censure writers, painters, architects, and every one who deals in the fine arts? Are such criticisms absurd and void of foundation? Have the foregoing expressions, familiar in all lan-guages"
"and among all people, no sort of meaning? This can hardly be: what is universal must have a foundation in nature. If we can reach this foundation, the stand-ard of taste will no longer be a secret."
"            All living creatures are by nature distri-buted into classes; the individuals of each, however diversified by slighter differences, having a wonderful uniformity in their ca-pital parts internal and external. Each class is distinguishable from others by an exter-nal form; and not less distinguishable by an internal constitution, manifested by cer-tain powers, feelings, desires, and actions, peculiar to the individuals of each class. Thus each class may be conceived to have a common nature, which, in framing the individuals belonging to the class, is taken for a model or standard."
"            Independent altogether of experience, men have a sense or conviction of a com-mon nature or standard, not only in their own species, but in every species of animals. And hence it is a matter of wonder, to find any individual deviating from the common nature of the species, whether in its inter-nal"
"or external construction: a child born with an aversion to its mother milk, is a matter of wonder, not less than if born with-out a mouth, or with more than oneSee Essays on morality and natural religion, part 1. es-say 2. ch. 1.."
"            With respect to this common nature or standard, we are so constituted as to con-ceive it to be perfect or right; and conse-quently that individuals ought to be made conformable to it. Every remarkable viation accordingly from the standard, makes an impression upon us of imperfection, irre-gularity, or disorder: it is disagreeable and raises in us a painful emotion: monstrous births, exciting the curiosity of a philoso-pher, fail not at the same time to excite a-version in a high degree."
"            Lastly, we have a conviction, that the common nature of man is invariable not less than universal: we conceive that it hath no relation to time nor to place; but that it will be the same hereafter as at pre-sent, and as it was in time past; the same among all nations and in all corners of the"
"earth. Nor are we deceived: giving al-lowance for the difference of culture and gradual refinement of manners, the fact corresponds to our conviction."
"            This conviction of a common nature or standard, and of its perfection, is the foun-dation of morality; and accounts clearly for that remarkable conception we have, of a right and a wrong taste in morals. It ac-counts not less clearly for the conception we have of a right and a wrong taste in the fine arts. A person who rejects objects gene-rally agreeable, and delights in objects ge-nerally disagreeable, is condemned as a mon-ster: we disapprove his taste as bad or wrong; and we have a clear conception that he deviates from the common stand-ard. If man were so framed as not to have any notion of a common standard, the pro-verb mentioned in the beginning would hold universally, not only in the fine arts but in morals: upon that supposition, the taste of every man, with respect to both, would to himself be an ultimate standard. But the conviction of a common standard being made a part of our nature, we intuitively conceive a taste to be right or good if con-formable"
"of a grand object to fix the attention, and swell the mind: in this state, it is disagree-able to contract the mind to a minute ob-ject, however elegant. The resembling an object to one that is greater, has, on the contrary, a good effect, by raising or swell the mind. One passes with satisfaction from a small to a great object; but cannot be drawn down, without reluctance, from great to small. Hence the following simi-les are faulty."

"            No particular concerning human nature is more universal, than the uneasiness a man feels when in matters of importance his pinions are rejected by others. Why should difference in opinion create uneasiness, more than difference in stature, in countenance, or in dress? The sense of a common standard is the only principle that can ex-plain this mystery. Every man, generally speaking, taking it for granted that his opi-nions agree with the common sense of man-kind, is therefore disgusted with those of a contrary opinion, not as differing from him, but as differing from the common standard. Hence in all disputes, we find the parties, each of them equally, appealing constantly to the common sense of mankind as the ul-timate rule or standard. Were it not for this standard, of which the conviction is niversal, I'cannot discover the slightest foun-dation for rancor or animosity when persons differ in essential points more than in points purely indifferent. With respect to the lat-ter, which are not supposed to be regulated"
"by any standard, individuals are permitted to think for themselves with impunity. The same liberty is not indulged with respect to the former: for what reason, other than that the standard by which these are regulated, ought, as we judge, to produce an unifor-mity of opinion in all men? In a word, to this sense of a common standard must be wholly attributed the pleasure we take in those who espouse the same principles and opinions with ourselves, as well as the aver-sion we have at those who differ from us. In matters left indifferent by the standard, we find nothing of the same pleasure or pain. A bookish man, unless swayed by convenience, relisheth not the contempla-tive more than the active part of mankind: his friends and companions are chosen in-differently out of either class. A painter consorts with a poet or musician, as readily as with those of his own art; and one is not the more agreeable to me for loving beef, as I do, nor the less agreeable for preferring mutton."
"            I have said, that my disgust is raised, not by differing from me, but by differing"
"from what I judge to be the common standard. This point, being of importance, ought to be firmly established. Men, it is true, are prone to flatter themselves, by ta-king it for granted, that their opinions and their taste are in all respects agreeable to the common standard. But there may be ex-ceptions, and experience shows there are some. There are instances without num-ber, of persons who cling to the grosser a-musements of gaming, eating, drinking, without having any relish for more elegant pleasures, such, for example, as are afforded by the fine arts. Yet these very persons, talking the same language with the rest of mankind, pronounce in favour of the more elegant pleasures: they invariably approve those who have a more refined taste, and are ashamed of their own as low and sensual. It is in vain to think of giving a reason for this singular impartiality against self, other than the authority of the common standard. Every individual of the human species, the most groveling not excepted, hath a natural sense of the dignity of human natureSee  11.."
"Hence every man is esteemed and respected in proportion to the dignity of his character, sentiments, and actions. And from the in-stances now given we discover, that the sense of the dignity of human nature is so vigorous, as even to prevail over self-par-tiality, and to make us despise our own taste compared with the more elevated taste of others."
"            In our sense of a common standard and in the pleasure individuals give us by their conformity to it, a curious final cause is dis-covered. An uniformity of taste and senti-ment in matters of importance, forms an intimate connection among individuals, and is a great blessing in the social state. With respect to morals in particular, unhappy it would be for mankind did not this unifor-mity prevail: it is necessary that the ac-tions of all men be uniform with respect to right and wrong; and in order to uniformi-ty of action, it is necessary that all men think the same way in these particulars: if they differ through any irregular bias, the common sense of mankind is appealed to as the rule; and it is the province of judges,"
"in matters especially of equity, to apply that rule. The same uniformity, it is yielded, is not so strictly necessary in other matters of taste: men, though connected in general as members of the same state, are, by birth, office, or occupation, sepa-rated and distinguished into different classes; and are thereby qualified for different a-musements: variety of taste, so far, is no obstruction to the general connection. But with respect to the more capital pleasures, such as are best enjoyed in common, uni-formity of taste is necessary for two great ends, first to connect individuals the more intimately in the social life, and next to vance these pleasures to their highest per-fection. With respect to the first, if instead of a common taste, every man had a taste peculiar to himself, leading him to place his happiness upon things indifferent or per-haps disagreeable to others, these capital pleasures could not be enjoyed in common: every man would pursue his own happi-ness by flying from others; and instead of a natural tendency to union, remarkable in the human species, union would be our"
"aversion: man would not be a consistent being: his interest would lead him to so-ciety, and his taste would draw him from it. The other end will be best explained by entering upon particulars. Uniformity of taste gives opportunity for sumptuous and elegant buildings, for fine gardens, and ex-tensive embellishments, which please uni-versally. Works of this nature could never have reached any degree of perfection, had every man a taste peculiar to himself: there could not be any suitable reward, either of profit or honour, to encourage men of ge-nius to labour in such works. The same uniformity of taste is equally necessary to perfect the arts of music, sculpture, and painting; and to support the expence they require after they are brought to perfection. Nature is in every particular consistent with herself. We are formed by nature to have a high relish for the fine arts, which are a great source of happiness, and extremely friendly to virtue. We are, at the same time, formed with an uniformity of taste, to furnish proper objects for this high relish: if uniformity of taste did not prevail, the"
"fine arts could never have made any figure."
"            Thus, upon a sense common to the species, is erected a standard of taste, which without hesitation is applyed to the taste of every individual. This standard, ascertain what actions are right what wrong, what proper what improper, hath enabled moralists to establish rules for our conduct from which no person is allowed to swerve. We have the same standard for ascertaining in all the fine arts, what is beautiful or ugly, high or low, proper or improper, proportioned or disproportioned. And here, as in morals, we justly condemn every taste that swerves from what is thus ascertained by the com-mon standard."
"            The discovery of a rule or standard for trying the taste of individuals in the fine arts as well as in morals, is a considerable vance, but completes not our journey. We have a great way yet to travel. It is made out that there is a standard: but it is not made out, by what means we shall prevent mistaking a false standard for that of na-ture. If from opinion and practice we en-deavour to ascertain the standard of nature,"
"we are betrayed into endless perplexities. Viewing this matter historically, nothing ap-pears more various and more wavering than taste in the fine arts. If we judge by num-bers, the Gothic taste of architecture will be preferred before that of Greece; and the Chinese taste probably before both. It would be endless, to recount the various tastes of gardening that have prevailed in different ages, and still prevail in different countries. Despising the modest colouring of nature, women of fashion in France daub their cheeks with a red powder. Nay, the unnatural swelling in the neck, a disease peculiar to the inhabitants of the Alps, is relished by that people. But we ought not to be discouraged by such untoward instan-ces. For do we not find the like contradic-tions with respect to morals? was it not once held lawful, for a man to expose his infant children, and, when grown up, to sell them for slaves? was it not held qually lawful, to punish children for the crime of their parents? was not the mur-der of an enemy in cold blood an universal practice? what stronger instance can be gi-ven,"
"than the abominable practice of hu-man sacrifices, not less impious than immo-ral? Such aberrations from the rules of morality, prove only, that men, originally savage and brutish, acquire not rationality or any delicacy of taste, till they be long disciplined in society. To ascertain the rules of morality, we appeal not to the common sense of savages, but of men in their more perfect state: and we make the same ap-peal, in forming the rules that ought to govern the fine arts. In neither can we safely rely on a local or transitory taste; but on what is the most universal and the most lasting among polite nations."
"            In this very manner, a standard for mo-rals has been established with a good deal of accuracy; and so well fitted for practice, that in the hand of able judges it is daily ap-plyed with general satisfaction. The stand-ard of taste in the fine arts, is not yet brought to such perfection. And there is an obvious reason for its slower progress. The sense of a right and a wrong in action, is conspicuous in the breast of every individual, almost without exception. The sense of a"
"right and a wrong in the fine arts, is more faint and wavering: it is by nature a tender plant, requiring much culture to bring it to maturity: in a barren soil it cannot live; and in any soil, without cultivation, it is weak and sickly. I talk chiefly with rela to its more refined objects: for some objects make such lively impressions of beau-ty, grandeur, and proportion, as without exception to command the general taste. There appears to me great contrivance, in distinguishing thus the moral sense from a taste in the fine arts. The former, as a rule of conduct and as a law we ought to obey, must be clear and authoritative. The latter is not intitled to the same authority, since it contributes to our pleasure and a-musement only. Were it more strong and lively, it would usurp upon our duty, and call off the attention from matters of greater moment. Were it more clear and authori-tative, it would banish all difference of taste: a refined taste would not form a character, nor be intitled to esteem. This would put an end to rivalship, and conse-quently to all improvement."

"But to return to our subject. However languid and cloudy the common sense of mankind may be with respect to the fine arts, it is yet the only standard in these as well as in morals. And when the matter is attentively considered, this standard will be sound less imperfect than it appears to be at first sight. In gathering the common sense of mankind upon morals, we may safely consult every individual. But with respect to the fine arts, our method must be differ-ent: a wary choice is necessary; for to collect votes indifferently, will certainly mis-lead us: those who depend for food on bodily labour, are totally void of taste; of such a taste at least as can be of use in the fine arts. This consideration bars the great-er part of mankind; and of the remaining part, many have their taste corrupted to such a degree as to unqualify them altogether for voting. The common sense of mankind must then be confined to the few that fall not under these exceptions. But as such selection seems to throw matters again into uncertainty, we must be more explicit up-on this branch of our subject."
"            "
"               "
"Nothing tends more than voluptuousness to corrupt the whole internal frame, and to vitiate our taste, not only in the fine arts, but even in morals. It never fails, in course of time, to extinguish all the sympathetic af-fections, and to bring on a beastly selfishness which leaves nothing of man but the shape. About excluding persons of this stamp there will be no dispute. Let us next bring un-der trial, the opulent whose chief pleasure is expence. Riches, coveted by most men for the sake of superiority and to command respect, are generally bestowed upon costly furniture, numerous attendants, a princely dwelling, every thing superb and gorgeous, to amaze and humble all beholders. Sim-plicity, elegance, propriety, and every thing natural, sweet, or amiable, are despised or neglected; for these are not at the com-mand of riches, and make no figure in the public eye. In a word, nothing is relished, but what serves to gratify pride, by an ima-gined exaltation of the possessor above those he reckons the vulgar. Such a tenor of life contracts the heart and makes every principle give way to self-interest. Benevo-lence"
"and public spirit, with all their refined emotions, are little felt and less regarded. And if these be excluded, there can be no place for the faint and delicate emotions of the fine arts."
"            The exclusion of classes so many and va-rious, reduces within a narrow compass those who are qualified to be judges in the fine arts. Many circumstances are neces-sary to form a judge of this sort: there must be a good natural taste: this taste must be improved by education, reflection, and ex-perience: it must be preserved alive, by a regular course of life, by using the goods of fortune with moderation, and by following the dictates of improved nature which gives welcome to every rational pleasure without deviating into excess. This is the tenor of life which of all contributes the most to re-finement of taste; and the same tenor of life contributes the most to happiness in ge-neral."
"            If there appear much uncertainty in a standard that requires so painful and intricate a selection, we may possibly be reconciled to it by the following consideration, That,"
"with respect to the fine arts, there is less difference of taste than is commonly imagi-ned. Nature hath marked all her works with indelible characters of high or low, plain or elegant, strong or weak. These, if at all perceived, are seldom misapprehend by any taste; and the same marks are qually perceptible in works of art. A defec-tive taste is incurable; and it hurts none but the possessor, because it carries no authority to impose upon others. I know not if there be such a thing as a taste naturally bad or wrong; a taste, for example, that prefers a groveling pleasure before one that is high and elegant. Groveling pleasures are ne-ver preferred: they are only made welcome by those who know no better. Differences about objects of taste, it is true, are endless: but they generally concern trifles, or pos-sibly matters of equal rank where the pre-ference may be given either way with impu-nity. If, on any occasion, the dispute go deeper and persons differ where they ought not, a depraved taste will readily be disco-vered on one or other side, occasioned by"
"imitation, custom, or corrupted manners, such as are described above."
"            If, after all that is said, the standard of taste be thought not yet sufficiently ascer-tained, there is still one resource in which I put great confidence. What I have in view, are the principles that constitute the sensitive part of our nature. By means of these principles, common to all men, a won-derful uniformity is preserved among the emotions and feelings of different indivi-duals; the same object making upon every person the same impression; the same in kind, at least, if not in degree. There have been aberrations, as above observed, from these principles; but soon or late they al-ways prevail, by restoring the wanderers to the right track. The uniformity of taste here accounted for, is the very thing that in other words is termed the common sense of mankind. And this discovery leads us to means for ascertaining the common sense of mankind or the standard of taste, more un-erringly than the selection above insisted on. Every doubt with relation to this standard, occasioned by the practice of different nations"
"and different times, may be cleared by ap-plying to the principles that ought to govern the taste of every individual. In a word, a thorough acquaintance with these principles will enable us to form the standard of taste; and to lay a foundation for this valuable branch of knowledge, is the declared purpose of the present undertaking."

"            APPENDIX. Terms defined or explained."
"            1. CONSIDERING the things I am con-scious of, some are internal or within my mind, some external or without. Passion, thinking, volition, are internal objects. Objects of sight, of hear  of smell, of touch, of taste, are exter-nal."
"            2. The faculty by which I discover an internal object, is termed an internal sense: the faculty by which I discover an external object, is termed an external sense. This distinction among the senses is made with reference to their objects merely; for the senses, external and internal, are equally powers or faculties of the mind."
"            3. But as self is an object, and the only one that cannot be termed either external"
"or internal, the faculty by which I am con-scious of myself, must be distinguished from both the internal and external senses."
"            4. By sight we perceive the qualities of figure, colour, motion, &amp : by the ear we perceive the qualities high, low, loud, soft: by touch we perceive rough, smooth, hot, cold, &amp : by taste we perceive sweet, sour, bitter, &amp : by smell we perceive fragrant, stinking, &amp  Qualities, from our very conception of them, are not capa-ble of an independent existence; but must belong to something of which they are the qualities. A thing with respect to its quali-ties is termed a subject, or substratum; be-cause its qualities rest, as it were, upon it, or are founded upon it. The subject or substratum of visible qualities, is termed substance, of audible qualities, sound; of tangible qualities, body. In like manner, taste is the substratum of qualities perceived by our sense of tasting; and smell is the substratum of qualities perceived by our sense of smelling."
"            5. Substance and sound are perceived existing in a certain place; often at a consi-derable"
"distance from the organ. But smell, touch, and taste, are perceived at the organs of sense."
"            6. Objects of internal sense are conceived to be attributes: deliberation, reasoning, resolution, willing, consenting, are internal actions: passions and emotions are internal agitations. With regard to the former, I am conscious of being active; with regard to the latter, I am conscious of being pas-sive."
"            7. Again, we are conscious of internal action as in the head; of passions and emo-tions as in the heart."
"            8. Many actions may be exerted inter-nally and many effects produced, of which we are not conscious. When we investi-gate the ultimate cause of animal motions, it is the most probable opinion, that they proceed from some internal power: and if so, we are, in this particular, unconscious of our own operations. But consciousness be implyed in the very conception of deli-berating, reasoning, resolving, willing, con-senting, these operations cannot go on with-out our knowledge. The same is the case"
"of passions and emotions; for no internal a-gitation is denominated a passion or emo  but what we are conscious of."
"            9. The mind is not always in the same state: it is at times chearful, melancholy, severe, peevish. These different states may not improperly be denominated tones. An object, by making an impression, produ-ceth an emotion or passion, which again gives the mind a certain tone suited to it."
"            10. Perception and sensation are com-monly reckoned synonymous terms, signi-fying the consciousness we have of objects; but, in accurate language, they are distin-guished. The consciousness we have of ex-ternal objects, is termed perception. Thus we are said to perceive a certain animal, a certain colour, sound, taste, smell, &amp  The consciousness we have of pleasure or pain arising from external objects, is termed sensation. Thus we have a sensation of cold, of heat, of the pain of a wound, of the pleasure of a landscape, of music, of beau-ty, of propriety, of behaviour, &amp  The consciousness we have of internal action, such as deliberation, resolution, choice, is"

"This simile seems to border upon the bur-lesque."
"            An error opposite to the former, is the introducing a resembling image, so elevated"
"never termed either a perception or a sen-sation."
"            11. Conception ought to be distinguished from perception. External things and their attributes are objects of perception: relations among things are objects of conception. I see two men, James and John: the conscious-ness I have of them is a perception: but the consciousness I have of their relation as father and son, is termed a conception. Again, per-ception relates to objects really existing: con-ception to fictitious objects, or to those framed by the imagination."
"            12. Feeling, beside denoting one of the external senses, has two different significa-tions. Of these the most common includes not only sensation, but also that branch of consciousness which relates to passions and emotions: it is proper to say, I have a feel of cold, of heat, or of pain; and it is not less proper to say, I have a feeling of love, of hatred, of anger, or of any other passion. But it is not applied to internal action: for it is not proper to say, that a man feels him-self deliberating or resolving. In a sense less common, feeling is put for the thing that is felt; and in this sense it is a general"
"term for every one of our passions and emo-tions."
"            13. That we cannot perceive an external object till an impression be made upon our body, is probable from reason, and is ascer-tained by experience. But it is not neces-sary that we be made sensible of the im-pression. It is true, that in touching, ta-sting, and smelling, we feel the impression made at the organ of sense: but in seeing and hearing, we feel no impression. We know indeed by experience, that before we perceive a visible object, its image is spread upon the retina tunica; and that before we perceive a sound, an impression is made up-on the drum of the ear: and yet here, we are not conscious either of the organic i-mage or the organic impression: nor are we conscious of any other operation preparatory to the act of perception. All we can say, is, that we see that river, or hear that trum-petYet a singular opinion that impressions are the only objects of perception, has been espoused by some philosophers of no mean rank; not attending to the foregoing peculiarity in the senses of seeing and hearing, that we perceive objects without being conscious of an organic impression or of any impression. See the treatise upon human nature, where we find the following passage, book 1.  4.  2. Properly speaking it is not our body we perceive when we regard our limbs and members; so that the ascribing a real and corporeal exist-ence to these impressions or to their objects, is an act of the mind as difficult to explain, &amp "

"14. Objects once perceived may be recall to the mind by the power of memory. When I recall an object in this manner, it appears to me the same as in the origi-nal survey, only more faint and obscure. For example, I saw yesterday a spreading oak growing on the brink of a river. I en-deavour to recall it to my mind. How is this operation performed? Do I endeavour to form in my mind a picture of it or repre-sentative image? Not so. I transport my-self ideally to the place where I saw the tree yesterday; upon which I have a perception of the tree and river, similar in all respects to the perception I had of it when I viewed it with my eyes, only more obscure. And in this recollection, I am not conscious of a picture or representative image, more than in the original survey: the perception is of"
"the tree itself, as at first. I confirm this by another experiment. After attentively sur-veying a fine statue, I close my eyes. What follows? The same object continues, with-out any difference but that it is less distinct than formerly. This indistinct secondary perception of an object, is termed an idea. And therefore the precise and accurate defi-nition of an idea, in contradistinction to an original perception, is, That perception or consciousness of a real object, which a person has by exercising the power of memory. Every thing one is conscious of, whether internal or external, passions, emotions, thinking, resolving, willing, heat, cold, &amp  as well as external objects, may be recalled as above by the power of memoryFrom this definition of an idea, the following proposition must be evident, That there can be no such thing as an innate idea. If the original perception of an object be not innate, which is obvious, it is not less obvious, that the idea or se-condary perception of that object cannot be innate. And yet to prove this self-evident proposition, Locke has bestowed a whole book of his treatise upon human understanding. So ne-cessary it is to give accurate definitions, and so preventive of dispute are definitions when accurate. Dr Berkeley has ta-ken great pains to prove another proposition equally evident, That there can be no such thing as a general idea. All our original perceptions are of particular objects, and our secondary perceptions or ideas must be equally so.."
"            "
"               "
"15. The original perceptions of external objects, are either simple or complex. A sound may be so simple as not to be resol-vable into parts: so may a taste and a smell. A perception of touch, is generally com-pounded of the more simple perceptions of hardness or softness, joined with smoothness or roughness, heat or cold, &amp  But of all the perceptions of external sense, that of a visible object is the most complex; be-cause the eye takes in more particulars than any other organ. A tree is composed of its trunk, branches, leaves: it has colour, fi-gure, size: every one of these separately produceth a perception in the mind of the spectator, which are all combined into the complex perception of the tree."
"            16. The original perception of an object of sight, is more complete, lively, and dis-tinct, than that of any other external sense: and for that reason, an idea or secondary"
"perception of a visible object, is more dis-tinct and lively than that of any other object. A fine passage in music, may, for a mo-ment, be recalled to the mind with tolera-ble accuracy: but the idea of any other ob-ject, and also of sound after the shortest in-terval, is extremely obscure."
"            17. As the range of an individual is com-monly within narrow bounds of space, op-portunities seldom offer of an enlarged ac-quaintance with external objects. Original perceptions therefore, and their correspond ideas, are a provision too scanty for the purposes of life. Language is an admirable contrivance for supplying this deficiency; for by language, the original perceptions of each individual may be communicated to all; and the same may be done by painting and other imitative arts. It is natural to suppose, that the most lively ideas are the most susceptible of being communicated to others. This holds more especially when language is the vehicle of communication; for language hitherto has not arrived at any greater perfection than to express clear and lively ideas. Hence it is, that poets and rators,"
"who are extremely successful in scribing objects of sight, find objects of the other senses too faint and obscure for lan-guage. An idea thus acquired of an object at second hand, ought to be distinguished from an idea of memory; though their re-semblance has occasioned the same term to be applyed to both. This is to be regretted; for when knowledge is to be communicated by language, ambiguity in the signification of words is a great obstruction to accuracy of conception. Thus nature hath furnished the means of multiplying ideas without end, and of providing every individual with a sufficient stock to answer, not only the ne-cessities, but even the elegancies of life."
"            18. Further, man is endued with a sort of creative power: he can fabricate ima-ges of things that have no existence. The materials employed in this opera  are ideas of sight, which may be taken to pieces and combined into new forms at pleasure: their complexity and vivacity make them fit materials. But a man has no such power over any of his ther ideas, whether of the external or in-ternal"
"'senses: he cannot, after the utmost effort, combine these into new forms: his ideas of such objects are too obscure for this operation. An image thus fabricated cannot be called a secondary perception, not being derived from an original perception: the poverty of language however, as in the case immediately above mentioned, has occasion the same term idea to be applyed to all. This singular power of fabricating images independent of real objects, is distinguished by the name imagination."
"            "
"            19. As ideas are the chief materials em-ployed in thinking, reasoning, and reflect  it is of consequence that their nature and differences be understood. It appears now, that ideas may be distinguished into three kinds; first, Ideas or secondary per-ceptions, properly termed ideas of memory; second, Ideas communicated by language or other signs; and, third, Ideas of imagi-nation. These ideas differ from each other in many respects; but the chief foundation of the distinction is the difference of their causes. The first kind are derived from real existences that have been objects of our"
"'senses: language is the cause of the second, or any other sign that has the same power with language; and a man imagination is to himself the cause of the third. It is scarce necessary to add, that an idea, origi-nally of imagination, being conveyed to others by language or any other vehicle, becomes in the mind of those to whom it is conveyed an idea of the second kind; and again, that an idea of this kind, being afterward re-called to the mind, becomes in that circum-stance an idea of memory."
"            20. Human nature is not so constituted, as that its objects are perceived with indif-ferency: these, with very few exceptions, raise in us either pleasant or painful emo-tions. External objects, at the same time, appear in themselves agreeable or disagree-able; but with some difference between those which produce organic impressions, and those which affect us from a distance. When we touch a soft and smooth body, we have a pleasant feeling as at the place of contact; and this feeling we distinguish not, at least not accurately, from the agreeable-ness of the body itself. The same holds"
"in general with regard to all the organic impressions. It is otherwise in hearing and seeing. A sound is perceived as in itself a-greeable; and, at the same time, raises in the hearer a pleasant emotion: an object of sight appears in itself agreeable; and, at the same time, raises in the seer a pleasant emotion. These are accurately distinguish  The pleasant emotion is felt as within the mind: the agreeableness of the object is placed upon the object, and is perceived as one of its qualities or properties. The a-greeable appearance of an object of sight, is termed beauty; and the disagreeable appear-ance of such an object is termed ugliness."
"            "
"            21. But though beauty and ugliness, in their proper and genuine signification, are confined to objects of sight; yet in a more lax and figurative signification, they are ap-plyed to objects of the other senses. They are sometimes applyed even to abstract terms; for it is not unusual to say, a beauti-ful theorem, a beautiful constitution of govern-ment. But I am inclined to think, that we are led to use such expression by conceiving"
"or great as to bear no proportion to the principal subject. The remarkable dispari-ty between them, being the most striking circumstance, seizes the mind, and never fails to depress the principal subject by con-trast, instead of raising it by resemblance: and if the disparity be exceeding great, the simile takes on an air of burlesque; nothing being more ridiculous than to force an ob-ject out of its proper rank in nature, by qualling it with one greatly superior or greatly inferior. This will be evident from the following comparisons."

"                  Ac veluti lentis Cyclopes fulmina massis"

"the thing as delineated upon paper, and as in some sort an object of sight."
"            22. A line composed by a precise rule, is perceived and said to be regular. A straight line, a parabola, a hyperbola, the circumfe-rence of a circle, and of an ellipse, are all of them regular lines. A figure composed by a precise rule, is perceived and said to be regular. Thus a circle, a square, a hexa-gon, an equilateral triangle, are regular fi-gures, being composed by a rule that deter-mines the form of each. When the form of a line or of a figure is ascertained by a rule that leaves nothing arbitrary, the line and the figure are said to be perfectly regu-lar: this is the case of the figures now men-tioned; and it is the case of a straight line and of the circumference of a circle. A fi-gure and a line are not perfectly regular where any part or circumstance is left arbi-trary. A parallelogram and a rhomb are less regular than a square: the parallelogram is subjected to no rule as to the length of sides, other than that the opposite sides be equal: the rhomb is subjected to no rule as to its angles, other than that the opposite angles be"
"equal. For the same reason, the circumfe-rence of an ellipse, the form of which is susceptible of much variety, is less regular than that of a circle."
"            23. Regularity, properly speaking, be-longs, like beauty, to objects of sight: like beauty, it is also applyed figuratively to other objects. Thus we say, a regular govern-ment, a regular composition of music, and, re-gular discipline."
"            "
"            24. When two figures are composed of similar parts, they are said to be uniform. Perfect uniformity is where the constituent parts of two figures are precisely similar to each other. Thus two cubes of the same dimensions are perfectly uniform in all their parts. An imperfect uniformity is, where the parts mutually correspond, but without being precisely similar. The uniformity is imperfect between two squares or cubes of unequal dimensions; and still more so be-twixt a square and a parallelogram."
"            25. Uniformity is also applicable to the constituent parts of the same figure. The constituent parts of a square are perfectly uniform: its sides are equal and its angles"
"are equal. Wherein then differs regularity from uniformity? for a figure composed of similar or uniform parts must undoubtedly be regular. Regularity is predicated of a fi-gure considered as a whole composed of re-sembling or uniform parts: uniformity a-gain is predicated of these parts as related to each other by resemblance. We say, a square is a regular, not an uniform figure: but with respect to the constituent parts of a square, we say not that they are regular, but that they are uniform."
"            26. In things destined for the same use, as legs, arms, eyes, windows, spoons, we expect uniformity. Proportion ought to govern parts intended for different uses. We require a certain proportion between a leg and an arm; in the base, the shaft, the capital, of a pillar; and in the length, the breadth, the height, of a room. Some pro-portion is also required in different things intimately connected, as between a dwell house, the garden, and the stables. But we require no proportion among things slightly connected, as between the table a man writes on and the dog that follows him."
"Proportion and uniformity never coincide: things perfectly similar are uniform; but proportion is never applied to them: the four sides and angles of a square are equal and perfectly uniform; but we say not that they are proportional. Thus, proportion always implies inequality or difference; but then it implies it to a certain degree only: the most agreeable proportion resembles a ma-ximum in mathematics; a greater or less in-equality or difference is less agreeable."
"            27. Order regards various particulars. First, in tracing or surveying objects, we are directed by a sense of order: we con-ceive it to be more orderly, that we should pass from a principle to its accessories and from a whole to its parts, than in the contrary direction. Next, with respect to the position of things, a sense of order di-rects us to place together things intimately connected. Thirdly, in placing things that have no natural connection, that order appears the most perfect, where the parti-culars are made to bear the strongest relation to each other that position can give them. Thus parallelism is the strongest relation"
"that position can bestow upon straight lines. If they be so placed as by production to in-tersect each other, the relation is less per-fect. A large body in the middle and two equal bodies of less size, one on each side, is an order that produces the strongest relation the bodies are susceptible of by position. The relation between the two equal bodies would be stronger by juxtaposition; but they would not both have the same relation to the third."
"            28. The beauty or agreeableness of an object, as it enters into the original percep  enters also into the secondary percep or idea. An idea of imagination is also agreeable; though in a lower degree than an idea of memory, where the objects are of the same kind. But this defect in the ideas of imagination is abundantly supplyed by their greatness and variety. For the i-magination acting without control, can fa-bricate ideas of finer visible objects, of more noble and heroic actions, of greater wic-kedness, of more surprising events, than ever in fact existed. And by communicating these ideas in words, painting, sculpture,"
"               &amp  the influence of the imagination is not less extensive than great."
"            29. In the nature of every man, there is somewhat original, that serves to distinguish him from others, that tends to form a cha-racter, and, with the concurrence of ex-ternal accidents, to make him meek or fie-ry, candid or deceitful, resolute or timorous, chearful or morose. This original bent is termed disposition. Which must be distin-guished from a principle: no original bent obtains the latter appellation, but what be-longs to the whole species. A principle makes part of the common nature of man: a disposition makes part of the nature of this or that man. A propensity compre-hends both; for it signifies indifferently ei-ther a principle or a disposition."
"            30. Affection, signifying a settled bent of mind toward a particular being or thing, oc-cupies a middle place between propensity on the one hand, and passion on the other. A propensity being original, must exist before any opportunity be offered to exert it: af-fection can never be original; because, ha-ving a special relation to a particular object,"
"it cannot exist till the object be presented. Again, passion depends on the presence of the object, in idea at least, if not in reality: when the idea vanishes, the passion vanishes with it. Affection, on the contrary, once settled on a person, is a lasting connection; and, like other connections, subsists even when we do not think of it. A familiar example will clear the whole. There may be in the mind a propensity to gratitude, which, through want of an object, happens never to be exerted, and which therefore is never discovered even by the person who has it. Another who has the same propensity, meets with a kindly office that makes him grateful to his benefactor: an intimate con-nection is formed between them, termed affection; which, like other connections, has a permanent existence, though not always in view. The affection, for the most part, lies dormant, till an opportunity offer of ex-erting it: in this circumstance, it is convert into the passion of gratitude; and the opportunity is greedily seized for testifying gratitude in the most complete manner."
"            31. Aversion, I think, must be opposed"
"to affection, and not to desire, as it common-ly is We have an affection for one person; we have an aversion to another: the former disposes us to do good to its object, the lat-ter to do ill."
"            32. What is a sentiment? It is not a perception; for a perception signifies our consciousness of external objects. It is not consciousness of an internal action; such as thinking, suspending thought, inclining, resolving, willing, &amp  Neither is it a con-ception of relation amongst objects or of their differences: a conception of this kind, is termed opinion.

"            33. Attention is that state of mind which prepares a man to receive impressions. Ac-cording to the degree of attention, objects make a stronger or weaker impressionBacon, in his natural history, makes the following ob-servations. Sounds are meliorated by the intension of the sense, where the common sense is collected most to the par-ticular sense of hearing, and the sight suspended. Therefore sounds are sweeter, as well as greater, in the night than in the day: and I suppose they are sweeter to blind men than to others: and it is manifest that between sleeping and waking, when all the senses are bound and suspended, music is far sweeter than when one is fully waking.."
"In an indolent state, or in a reverie, objects make but a slight impression; far from what they make when they command our atten  In a train of perceptions, no single object makes such a figure as it would do single and apart: for when the attention is divided among many objects, no single ob-ject is intitled to a large share. Hence the stillness of night contributes to terror, there being nothing to divert the attention."

Had we power equally to with-hold our at-tention from matters of importance, we might be proof against any deep impression.

"            35. Genus, species, modification, are terms invented to distinguish beings from each ther. Individuals are distinguished by their qualities: a large class of individuals enjoy qualities in common, is termed a genus: a subdivision of such class is termed a spe-cies. Again, that circumstance which dis-tinguisheth one genus, one species, or ven one individual, from another, is term-ed"
"a modification: the same particular that is termed a property or quality when consi-dered as belonging to an individual or a class of individuals, is termed a modification when considered as distinguishing the individual or the class from another. A black skin and soft curled hair, are properties of a ne-gro: the same circumstances considered as marks that distinguish a negro from a man of a different species, are denominated mo-difications."
"            "
"            36. Objects of sight, being complex, are distinguishable into the several particulars that enter into the composition: these ob-jects are all of them coloured; and they all have length, breadth, and thickness. When I behold a spreading oak, I distinguish in this object, size, figure, colour, and some-times motion: viewing a flowing river, I distinguish colour, figure, and constant mo  a dye has colour, black spots, six plain surfaces, all equal and uniform. The objects of touch, have all of them extension. Some of them are felt rough, some smooth: some of them are hard, some soft. With respect to the other senses, some of their ob-jects"
"are simple, some complex: a sound, a taste, a smell, may be so simple as not to be distinguishable into any parts: others are perceived to be compounded of different sounds, different tastes, and different smells."
"            37. The eye at one look can take in a number of objects, as of trees in a field, or men in a crowd: as these objects are distinct from each other, each having a separate and independent existence, they are distin-guishable in the mind as well as in reality; and there is nothing more easy, than to abs-tract from some and to confine our con-templation to others. A large oak with its spreading branches, fixes our attention upon itself, and abstracts us from the shrubs that surround it. In the same manner, with respect to compounded sounds, tastes, or smells, we can fix our thoughts upon any one of the component parts, abstracting our attention from the rest. But the power of abstraction is not confined to objects that are separable in reality as well as mentally: it also takes place where there can be no real separation. The size, the figure, the colour, of a tree, are inseparably connected,"
"and cannot exist independent of each other: the same of length, breadth, and thickness: and yet we can mentally confine our ob-servations to one of these, neglecting or abs-tracting from the rest. Here abstraction takes place where there cannot be a real separation."
"            38. This power of abstraction is of great utility. A carpenter considers a log of wood, with regard to hardness, firmness, colour, and texture: a philosopher, neglect-ting these properties, makes the log under-go a chymical analysis; and examines its taste, its smell, and its component princi-ples: the geometrician confines his reason to the figure, the length, breadth, and thickness. In general, every artist, abstract from all other properties, confines his observations to those which have a more im-mediate connection with his profession."
"            39. Hence clearly appears the meaning of an abstract term, and abstract idea. If in viewing an object, we can abstract from some of its parts or properties, and attach ourselves to others; there must be the same facility, when we recall this object to the"
"mind in idea. This leads directly to the definition of an abstract idea, viz. "
"               A par-tial view of a complex object, limited to one or more of the component parts or properties, laying aside or abstracting from others. A word that denotes an abstract idea, is called an abstract term."
"            "
"            40. The power of abstraction is bestowed upon man, for the purposes solely of rea-soning. It tends greatly to the facility as well as clearness of any process of reasoning, that, withdrawing from every other circum-stance, we can confine our attention to the single property we desire to investigate."
"            41. Abstract ideas, may, I think, be distinguished into three different kinds, all equally subservient to the reasoning faculty. Individuals appear to have no end; and did we not possess the faculty of distributing them into classes, the mind would be lost in an endless variety, and no progress be made in knowledge. It is by the faculty of abstraction that we distribute beings into genera and species: finding a number of individuals connected by certain qualities common to all, we give a name to these"
"individuals considered as thus connected; which name, by gathering them together into one class, serves in a curt manner to express the whole of these individuals as distinct from others. Thus the word ani-mal serves to denote every being which hath self-motion; and the words man, horse, lion, &amp  answer similar purposes. This is the first and most common sort of abstrac  and it is of the most extensive use, by enabling us to comprehend in our rea-soning whole kinds and sorts, instead of in-dividuals without end. The next sort of abstract ideas and terms comprehends a number of individual objects considered as connected by some occasional relation. A great number of persons collected together in one place, without any other relation but merely that of contiguity, are deno-minated a crowd: in forming this term, we abstract from sex, from age, from condition, from dress, &amp  A number of persons connected by being subject to the same laws and to the same go-vernment, are termed a nation; and a number of men subjected to the same mili-tary"
"command, are termed an army. A third sort of abstraction is, where a single property or part, which may be common to many individuals, is selected to be the subject of our contemplation; for example, whiteness, heat, beauty, length, roundness, head, arm."
"            42. Abstract terms are a happy invention: it is by their means chiefly, that the particu-lars which we make the subject of our rea-soning, are brought into close union, and se-parated from all others however naturally connected. Without the aid of such terms, the mind could never be kept steady to its proper subject, but would perpetually be in hazard of assuming foreign circumstances or neglecting what are essential. In a word, a general term denotes in a curt man-ner certain objects occasionally combined. We can, without the aid of language, com-pare real objects by intuition, when these objects are present; and, when absent, we can compare them by means of the ideas we have of them: but when we advance farther, and attempt to make inferences, and draw conclusions, we always employ"
"abstract terms, even in thinking. It would be as difficult to reason without them, as to perform operations in al-gebra without signs: for there is scarce any reasoning without some degree of abs-traction; and we cannot abstract to pur-pose without making use of general terms. Hence it follows, that without language man would scarce be a rational being."
"            43. The same thing, in different respects, has different names. With respect to cer-tain qualities, it is termed a substance; with respect to other qualities, a body; and with respect to qualities of all sorts, a subject: it is termed a passive subject with respect to an action exerted upon it; an object with re-spect to a percipient; a cause with respect to the effect it produces; and an effect with respect to its cause."

Such phantom similes are mere witticisms, which ought to have no quarter, except where purposely introduced to provoke laughter. Lucian, in his dissertation upon history, talking of a certain author, makes the following comparison, which is verbal merely."

"             XX. FIGURES."
"            THE reader must not expect to find here a complete list of the different tropes and figures that have been carefully noted by ancient critics and gram-marians. Tropes and figures have indeed been multiplied with so little reserve, as to make it no easy matter to distinguish them from plain language. A discovery al-most accidental, made me think of giving them a place in this work: I found that the most important of them depend on principles formerly explained; and I was glad of an opportunity to show the exten-sive influence of these principles. Con-fining myself therefore to figures that an-swer this purpose, I am luckily freed from much trash; without dropping, so far as I remember, any figure that merits a proper"
"name. And I begin with Prosopopoeia or personification, which is justy intitled to the first place."
"            "
"                I. PERSONIFICATION."
"               THis figure, which gives life to things in-animate, is so bold a delusion as to re-quire, one should imagine, very peculiar cir-cumstances for operating the effect. And yet, in the language of poetry, we find variety of expressions, which, though commonly reduced to this figure, are used without ceremony or any sort of preparation. I give, for example, the following expressions. Thirsty ground, hungry church-yard, furious dart, angry ocean. The epithets here, in their proper meaning, are attributes of sen-sible beings. What is the effect of such epithets, when applyed to things inani-mate? Do they raise in the mind of the reader a perception of sensibility? Do they"
"make him conceive the ground, the church-yard, the dart, the ocean, to be endued with animal functions? This is a curious inquiry; and whether so or not, it cannot be declined in handling the present subject."
"               One thing is certain, that the mind is prone to bestow sensibility upon things ina-nimate, where that violent effect is necessary to gratify passion. This is one instance, a-mong many, of the power of passion to adjust our opinions and belief to its grati-ficationChap. 2. part 5.. I give the following examples. Antony, mourning over the body of Cae-sar, murdered in the senate-house, vents his passion in the following words."
"                     "
"                        Antony."
"                        pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,"
"                        That I am meek and gentle with these butchers."
"                        Thou art the ruins of the noblest man"
"                        That ever lived in the tide of times."
"                     "
"                     Julius Caesar, act 3. sc. 4."
"                  "
"Here Antony must have been impressed with some sort of notion, that the body of"
"Caesar was listening to him, without which the speech would be foolish and absurd. Nor will it appear strange, after what is said in the chapter above cited, that passion should have such power over the mind of man. Another example of the same kind is, where the earth, as a common mother, is animated to give refuge against a father unkindness."

"               Plaintive passions are extremely solicitous for vent. A soliloquy commonly answers"
"the purpose. But when a passion swells high, it is not satisfied with so slight a gra-tification: it must have a person to com-plain to; and if none be found, it will ani-mate things devoid of sense. Thus Philoc-tetes complains to the rocks and promonto-ries of the isle of LemnosPhiloctetes of Sophocles, act 4. sc. 2.; and Alcestes dying, invokes the sun, the light of day, the clouds, the earth, her husband palace, &amp "
"                  Alcestes of Euripides, act 2. sc. 1.. Plaintive passions carry the mind still farther. Among the many principles that connect individuals in society, one is re-markable: it is that principle which makes us earnestly wish, that others should enter into our concerns and think and feel as we doSee this principle accounted for,  25.. This social principle, when inflamed by a plaintive passion, will, for want of a more complete gratification, prompt the mind to give life even to things inanimate. Moschus, lamenting the death of Bion, conceives that the birds, the fountains, the trees, lament with him. The shepherd,"

"               I have been profuse of examples, to show what power many passions have to animate their objects. In all the foregoing exam-ples, the personification, if I mistake not, is so complete as to be derived from an ac-tual conviction, momentary indeed, of life and intelligence. But it is evident from numberless instances, that personification is not always so complete. Personification is a common figure in descriptive poetry, un-derstood to be the language of the writer, and not of any of his personages in a fit of passion. In this case, it seldom or never comes up to a conviction, even momenta-ry, of life and intelligence. I give the fol-lowing examples."

"It may, I presume, be taken for granted, that, in the foregoing instances, the perso-nification, either with the poet or his read-er, amounts not to a conviction of intelli-gence; nor that the sun, the moon, the"
"day, the morn, are here understood to be sensible beings. What then is the nature of this personification? Upon considering the matter attentively, I discover that this species of personification must be referred to the imagination. The inanimate object is imagined to be a sensible being, but without any conviction, even for a moment, that it really is so. Ideas or fictions of i-magination have power to raise emotions in the mindSee appendix, containing definitions and explanation of terms.; and when any thing inanimate is, in imagination, supposed to be a sensible being, it makes by that means a greater fi-gure than when an idea is formed of it ac-cording to truth. The elevation however in this case, is far from being so great as when the personification arises to an actual conviction; and therefore must be consi-dered as of a lower or inferior sort. Thus personification is of two kinds. The first or nobler, may be termed passionate personi-fication: the other, or more humble, scriptive personification; because seldom or"
"never is personification in a description car-ried the length of conviction."
"               The imagination is so lively and active, that its images are raised with very little ef-fort; and this justifies the frequent use of descriptive personification. This figure a-bounds in Milton Allegro and Penseroso."
"               "
"               Abstract and general terms, as well as particular objects, are often necessary in poetry. Such terms however are not well adapted to poetry, because they suggest not any image to the mind: I can readily form an image of Alexander or Achilles in wrath; but I cannot form an image of wrath in the abstract, or of wrath inde-pendent of a person. Upon that account, in works addressed to the imagination, ab-stract terms are frequently personified. But this personification never goes farther than the imagination."

"               Hitherto our progress has been upon firm ground. Whether we shall be so lucky in the remaining part of the journey, seems doubtful. For after acquiring some knowledge of the subject, when we now look back to the expressions mentioned in the beginning, thirsty ground, furious dart, and such like, it seems as difficult as at first to say what sort of personification it is. Such expressions evidently raise not the slightest conviction of sensibility. Nor do I think they amount to descriptive personifi-cation: in the expressions mentioned, we do not so much as figure the ground or the"
"dart to be animated; and if so, they cannot at all come under the present subject. And to show this more clearly, I shall endeavour to explain what effect such expressions have naturally upon the mind. In the expression angry ocean, for example, do we not ta-citly compare the ocean in a storm, to a man in wrath? It is by this tacit compa-rison, that the expression acquires a force or elevation, beyond what is found when an epithet is used proper to the object: for I have had occasion to showChap. 19., that a thing inanimate acquires a certain elevation by being compared to a sensible being. And this very comparison is itself a demonstration, that there is no personification in such expres-sions. For, by the very nature of a com-parison, the things compared are kept dis-tinct, and the native appearance of each is preserved. It will be shown afterward, that expressions of this kind belong to ano-ther figure, which I term a figure of speech, and which employs the seventh section of the present chapter."

"With respect to these and numberless other instances of the same kind, whether they be examples of personification or of a fi-gure of speech merely, seems to be an ar-bitrary question. They will be ranged un-der the former class by those only who are endued with a sprightly imagination. Nor will the judgement even of the same person be steady: it will vary with the present state of the spirits, lively or composed."
"               Having thus at large explained the pre-sent figure, its different kinds, and the prin-ciples from whence derived; what comes next in order is to ascertain its proper pro-vince, by showing in what cases it is suita-ble, in what unsuitable. I begin with observing, upon passionate personification, that this figure is not promoted by every passion indifferently. All dispiriting passions are averse to it. Remorse, in particular, is too serious and severe, to be gratified by"
"a phantom of the mind. I cannot therefore approve the following speech of Enobarbus, who had deserted his master Antony."

"               Secondly, After a passionate personifica is properly introduced, it ought to be confined strictly to its proper province, that of gratifying the passion; and no sentiment nor action ought to be exerted by the ani-mated object, but what answers that pur-pose. Personification is at any rate a bold figure, and ought to be employed with great reserve. The passion of love, for ex-ample,"
"in a plaintive tone, may give a mo-mentary life to woods and rocks, that the lover may vent his distress to them: but no passion will support a conviction so far stretched, as that these woods and rocks should be living witnesses to report the di-stress to others:"

"One must read this passage very seriously to avoid laughing. The following passage is quite extravagant: the different parts of the human body are too intimately con-nected with self, to be personified by the power of any passion; and after converting such a part into a sensible being, it is still worse to make it be conceived as rising in rebellion against self."

"               "
"               Next comes descriptive personification; upon which I must observe in general, that"
"it ought to be cautiously used. A person-age in a tragedy, agitated by a strong pas-sion, deals in strong sentiments; and the reader, catching fire by sympathy, relishes the boldest personifications. But a writer, even in the most lively description, ought to take a lower flight, and content himself with such easy personifications as agree with the tone of mind inspired by the description. In plain narrative, again, the mind, serious and sedate, rejects personification altoge-ther. Strada, in his history of the Belgic wars, has the following passage, which, by a strained elevation above the tone of the subject, deviates into burlesk. Vix scenderat a praetoria navi Caesar; cum foeda illico exorta in portu tempestas, classem impetu disjecit, praetoriam hau-sit: quasi non vecturam amplius Caesa-rem, Caesarisque fortunamDec. 1.  1.. Neither do I approve, in Shakespear, the speech of King John, gravely exhorting the citizens of Angiers to a surrender; though a tragic writer has much greater latitude than a hi-storian."
"Take the following specimen of this speech."
"                     "
"                        The cannons have their bowels full of wrath;"
"                        And ready mounted are they to spit forth"
"                        Their iron-indignation 'gainst your walls."
"                     "

"                  "
"               "
"               Secondly, If extraordinary marks of re-spect put upon a person of the lowest rank be ridiculous, not less so is the personifica of a mean object. This rule chiefly regards descriptive personification: for an object can hardly be mean that is the cause of a violent passion; in that circumstance, at least, it must be an object of importance. With respect to this point, it would be in vain to set limits to personification: taste is the only rule. A poet of superior genius hath more than others the command of this figure; because he hath more than thers the power of inflaming the mind. Homer appears not extravagant in anima-ting his darts and arrows: nor Thomson in animating the seasons, the winds, the rains, the dews. He even ventures to animate the diamond, and doth it with propriety."

"                  "

"               Fifthly, The enthusiasm of passion may have the effect to prolong passionate perso-nification: but descriptive personification cannot be dispatched in too few words. A minute description dissolves the charm, and makes the attempt to personify appear ridi-culous. Homer succeeds in animating his darts and arrows: but such personification spun out in a French translation, is mere burlesk:"

"                III. HYPERBOLE."
"               IN this figure we have another effect of the foregoing principle. An object un-common with respect to size, either very great of its kind or very little, strikes us with surprise; and this emotion, like all others, prone to gratification, forces upon the mind a momentary conviction that the object is greater or less than it is in reality. The same effect, precisely, attends figura-tive grandeur or littleness. Every object that produceth surprise by its singularity, is always seen in a false light while the emo subsists: circumstances are exaggera-ted beyond truth; and it is not till after the emotion subsides, that things appear as they are. A writer, taking advantage of this"
"natural delusion, enriches his description greatly by the hyperbole. And the read-er, even in his coolest moments, relishes this figure, being sensible that it is the ope-ration of nature upon a warm fancy."
"               It will be observed, that a writer is gene-rally more successful in magnifying by a hyperbole than in diminishing: a minute object contracts the mind, and fetters its power of conception; but the mind, dila-ted and inflamed with a grand object, moulds objects for its gratification with great facility. Longinus, with respect to the di-minishing power of a hyperbole, cites the following ludicrous thought from a comic poet. He was owner of a bit of ground not larger than a Lacedemonian let-ter  31. of his treatise on the sublime. But, for the reason now given, the hyperbole has by far the greater force in magnifying objects; of which take the fol-lowing specimen."
"                     For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a"

"               QuintilianL. 8. cap. 6. in fin. is fensible that this figure is natural. For, says he, not content with truth, we naturally incline to augment or diminish beyond it; and for that reason the hyperbole is familiar even among the vulgar and illiterate. And he adds, very justly, That the hyperbole is then proper, when the subject of itself

exceeds the common measure. From these premisses, one would not expect the following conclusion, the only reason he can find for justifying this figure of speech. Conceditur enim amplius dicere, quia dici quantum est, non potest: meliusque ultra quam citra stat oratio. (We are in-dulged to say more than enough, because we cannot say enough; and it is better to be over than under). In the name of won-der, why this slight and childish reason, when immediately before he had made it evident, that the hyperbole is founded on human nature? I could not resist this per-sonal stroke of criticism, intended not a-gainst our author, for no human creature is exempt from error; but against the blind veneration that is paid to the ancient classic writers, without distinguishing their ble-mishes from their beauties."
"               Having examined the nature of this fi-gure, and the principle on which it is rected; I proceed, as in the first section, to some rules by which it ought to be govern  And in the first place, it is a capital fault to introduce an hyperbole in the scription"
"of an ordinary object or event which creates no surprise. In such a case, the hyperbole is altogether unnatural, being destitute of surprise, the only foundation that can support it. Take the following in-stance, where the subject is extremely fa-miliar, viz. swimming to gain the shore after a shipwreck."

"               Thirdly, a writer, if he wish to succeed, ought always to have the reader in his eye. He ought in particular never to venture a bold thought or expression, till the reader be warmed and prepared for it. For this reason, an hyperbole in the beginning of a-ny work can never be in its place. Ex-ample:"

"has a bad effect. Longinus, in the above-cited chapter, with great propriety of thought, enters a caveat against an hyper-bole of this kind. He compares it to a bowstring, which relaxes by overstrain  and produceth an effect directly oppo-site to what is intended. I pretend not to ascertain any precise boundary: the attempt would be difficult, if not impracticable. I must therefore be satisfied with an humbler task, which is, to give a specimen of what I reckon overstrained hyperboles; and I shall be also extremely curt upon this subject, because examples are to be found every where. No fault is more common among writers of inferior rank; and instances are found even among those of the finest taste; witness the following hyperbole, too bold even for an Hotspur.

As it cannot be relished but in the hurry and swelling of the mind, a leisurely view dissolves the charm, and discovers the scription to be extravagant at least, and perhaps also ridiculous.

"                 A figure, which, among related objects, ex-tends properties of one to another."
"               THis figure is not dignified with a pro-per name, because it has been over-looked by all writers. It merits, however, place in this work; and must be distinguished from those formerly handled, as depend on a different principle. Giddy brink, jovial wine, daring wound, are examples of this figure. Here are expressions that cer-tainly import not the ordinary relation of an adjective to its substantive. A brink, for example, cannot be termed giddy in a proper sense: neither can it be termed giddy in any figurative sense that can import any of its qualities or attributes. When we at-tend to the expression, we discover that a brink is termed giddy from producing that effect in those who stand on it. In the same manner a wound is said to be daring,"
