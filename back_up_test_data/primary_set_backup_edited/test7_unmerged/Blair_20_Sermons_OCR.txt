"On the TRUE HONOUR of MAN."
"PROVERBS,  8."
"Exalt her, and Jh Jall promote thee; /he fJall bring thee to bonour IHE love of honour is one of the "
"'strongest passions in the human ."
"heart. It ihows itself in our earliest years; and is coeval with the first exertions of reason. It accompanies us through all the itages of subsequent life; and in private stations discovers itself no less than in the higher ranks of society. In their ideas of what conflitutes honour, men Vo.. III. greatly .("
"SEn  greatly vary, and often grossly err. But I. of somewhat which they conceive to form pre-eminence and diltinclion, all are delirous. All with, by tome means or other, to acquire refipcl fiom those among whom they live; and to contempt andl liigracc, none are inlenfible."
"Among the advantages which attend religion and virtue, the honour which they confer on man is frequently mentioned in scripture as one of the moit considerable."
"71'fitom is the principal thing, lays Solomon in the passage where the text lies, therefore get wildom; and wibt all thy getting, get under/landing. Exalt her, and Jhc ball promote thee; jhe JIall bring thee to honour, when thou dofl embrace her. Sheb Jallgive to tl ne head an ornament of grace; a crown o5 glory Jhall/he deliver to thee. It is evident that throughout all the sacred writings, and particularly in this book of Proverbs, by fdon is to be underflood a principle of religion producing virtuous conduct. The fear of the Lord is said to be the beginning of wiridom: And by this fear of the Lord men men are aiid to dc  fr::' evil; to walk ' "
"i/ ihe iwa  good imen, and It ' the path 'of ribticoIs *. Man is  regulated by tlCh wIf.i/!: ic/'i/uJ is frcmi al'.ve, when hl is formed bh picty to the duties of virtue and morality; and of the wild!om which produces this elFect, it is afelrted in the text, that it brinrcrth us to bor.: "
"On this recommendation of religion it is the more neceflarv to fix our attention, because it is often refuft to it by men of the world. Their notions of honour are apt to run in a very different channel."
"Wherever religion is mentioned, they conn. with it ideas of melancholy and dejedion, or of mean and feeble spirits. They perhaps admit that it may be ufefull to the multitude, as a principle of reitraint from disorders and crimes; and that to persons of a peculiar turn of mind, it may afford consolation under the diltrecles of life. But from the acive scenes of the world, and from those vigorous exertions which difplay to advantage the human abilities, they Prov.  20."
" incline totally to exclude it. It may tooth a_, the timid, or the fad: But they confider it as having no connection with what is pro."
"per to raise men to honour and diftintion."
"I flall now endeavour to remove this reproach from religion; and to fiow that in every situation of human life, even in the highest stations, it forms the honour, as well as the happiness of man."
"But first, let us be careful to ascertain what true religion is. I admit that there is a certain species of religion (if we can give it that name) which has no claim to such high diftinicion; when it is placed wholly in speculation and belief, in the regularity of external homage, or in fiery zeal about contested opinions. From a fuperftition inherent in the human mind, the religion of the multitude has always been tinctured with too much of this spirit."
"They serve God as they would serve a proud master, who may be flattered by their prostrations, appeased by their gifts, and gained by loud protestations of attachment to his interests, and of enmity to all whom whom they suppose to be his foes. But this is not that wisdom to which Solomon '"
"ascribes, in the text, such high prerogatives. It is not the religion which we preach, nor the religion of Chrit. That religion consists in the love of God and the love of man, grounded on faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Redeemer of the world, the Intercessor for the penitent, and the Patron of the virtuous; through whom we enjoy comfortable access to the Sovereign of the universe in the ads of worship and devotion. It consists in juftice, hutnanity, and mercy; in a fair and candid mild, a generous and affeCionate heart; accompanied with temperance, selfgovernment, and a perpetual regard in all our actions to conscience, and to the law of God. A religious, and a thoroughly virtuous characer, thercfore, I confider as the fame."
"BY the true honour of man is to be underftood, not what merely commands external refped, but what commands the reB 3 fpea  fpeca of the heart; what raises one to ac_ knowledged eminence above others of the %ltme fpecics; what always creates esteem, and in its highest degree, produces veneration. The queltion now before us is, from what caute this eminence arises ? By what means is it to be attained ?"
"I SAY, firfi, from riches it does not arise."
"These, we all know, may belong to the vilelt of mankind. Providence has fcattcrcd them among the crowd with an undiftinguilhing hand, as of purpote to show of what finall account they are in the fight of God. Experience every day proves that the possession of them is confiflent with the most general contempt. On this point therefore I conceive it not necessary to inlilt any longer."
"NEITHER does the honour of man arise from mere dignity of rank or office. Were uich dittincions alwa  or even generally, obtained in confc(luence of uncommon merit, they would indeed confer honour on tle characler. But, in the lpreient slate of ibciety, "
"On the True HoIlour of Mal. 7 society, it is too well known that this is not the ciall. They arc often the confe- ..."
"quence of birth alone. They are tometimes the fruit of mere dependence and afliduity. They may be the rccumpence of flattery, veriatility, and intrigue ; and so be conjoined with meanness and bafiness of character. To pcrfons graced with noble birth, or placed in high itations, much external honour is due. This is what the subordination of society neceilarily requires; and what every good member of it will chearfully yield. But how often has it happened that such persons, when externally respected, are, nevertheless, despised by men in their hearts; nay, sometimes execrated by the public ? Their elevation, if they have been unworthy of it, is so far from procuring them true honour, that it only renders their infignificance, perhaps their infamy, more confpicuous. By drawing attention to their conduct, it discovers in the most glaring light how little they deserved the itation which they poffcfs."
"B4 I  I MUST next observe, that the proper ho,_._ nour of man arises not from some of those lplendid actions and abilities which excite high admiration. Courage and prowess, military renown, frgnal vicories and conquefis, may render the name of a man famous, without rendering his character truly honourable. To many brave men, to many heroes renowned in dtory, we look up with wonder. Their exploits are recorded. Their praises are fiung. They fland as on an eminence above the reft of mankind. Their emirnence, nevertheless, may not be of that fort before which we bow with inward esteem and. refpeA. Something more is wanted for that purpose, than the conquering arm, ahnd the intrepid mind."
"The laurels of the warrior must at all times be dyed in blood, and bedewed' with the tears of the widow and the orphan. But if they have been stained by rapine and inhumanity; if fordid avarice has marked his charater; or low and gross sensuality has degraded his life; the great hero finks into a little man. What at a distance, or on a superficial superficial view, we admired, becomes mean, "
"perhaps odious, when we examine it more closely. It is like the Colossal statue, Whose; immense size struck the fpetator afar off with astonishment; but when nearly viewed, it appears disproportioned, unihapely, and rude."
"Observations of the fame kind may be applied to all the reputation derived from civil accomplishments; from the refined politics of the statesman; or the literary efforts of genius and erudition. These bestow, and, within certain bounds, ought to bestow, eminence and diftin&ion on men: They discover talents which in them."
"'selves are flining; and which become highly valuable, when employed in advancing the good of mankind. Hence, they frequently give rife to fame. But a diftinction is to be made between fame and true honour. The former.is a loud' and noisy applatfe: The latter, a more silent and internal homage. Fame floats on tie' breath of the multitude: Honour refts on the judgement of the thinking. Fame may give . give praise while it with-holds esteei:"
"True honour implies eftecm mingled with refped. The one regards particular diftinguifhed talents: the other looks up to the whole character. Hence the statesman, the orator, or the poet, may be famous; ile yet the man himself is far from being honoured. We envy his abilities. We with to rival them. But we would not chute to be clalfed with him who poifefled them."
"Instances of this fort arc too often found in every record of ancient or modern history."
"FROM all this it follows, that in order to discern where man true honour lies, we must look, not to any adventitious circumstance of fortune; not to any single sparkling quality; but to the whole of what forms a man; what intitles him, as such, to rank high among that class of beings to which he belongs; in a word, we must look to the mind and the foul.- A mind fuiperior to fear, to selfish interest and corruption; a mind governed by the principles of uniform reCtitude and integrity; the fame in prosperity prosperity and adversity; which no bribe "
"can seduce, nor terror overawe; neither by pleasure melted into effeminacy, nor by distress funk into dejection; such is the mind which forms the diflincion and eminence of man. One, who in no fituation of life is either ashamed or afraid of dilcharging his duty, and acting his proper part with firmnels and constancy; true to the God whom he worships, and true to the faith in which he professes to believe; full of affcction to his brethren of mankind; faithful to his friends, generous to his enemies, warm with compassion to the unfortunate; fclf-denying to little private interests and pleasures, but zealous for public interest and happiness; magnanimous, without being proud; humble, without being mean; jult, without being harsh; fimpie in his manners, but manly in his feelings; on whose word you can entirely rely; whose countenance never deceives you; whose profeifions of kindness are the effusions of his heart: one, in fine, whom independent of any views of advantage, you would *"
"ERM . Would chufe for a superior, could trust in as a friend, and could love as a brother:"
"- This is the man, whoil in your heart, above all others, you do, you must, hoflour."
"SucH a character, imperfc&ly as it has now been drawn, all must acknowledge to be formed solely by the influence of steady religion and virtue. It is the effect of principles which, operating on conscience, determine it uniformly to pursue wbatfoever things are true, wbatfoever things are bonfi, wbatfoever things are juJt, wbatfoever things are pure, whbafoever things are lovely, wbatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise *. By there means, wi/hom, as the text aflerts, bringetb us to bonour."
"IN confirmation of this doctrine it is to be observed, that the honour which man acquires by religion and virtue is more independent, and more complete, than what * Philip.  8."
"can Gan be acquired by any other means. It is sERM."
"independent of any thing foreign or exter- ._ na. It is not partial, but entire refpet, which it procures. Wherever fortune is concerned, it is the station or rank which commands our deference. Where some fhining quality attracts admiration, it is only to a part of the character that we pay homage. But when a person is diftinguiihed for eminent worth and goodness, it.is the man, the whole man, whom we refpe&"
"The honour which he pofeffes is intrinsic."
"Place him in any situation of life, even an obscure one; let room only be given for his virtues to come forth and lhow themselves, and you will revere him; as a private citizen; or as the father of a family."
"If in higher life he appear more illustrious, this is not owing merely to the refped created by rank. It is, because there a nobler sphere of action is opened to him; because his virtues are brought forth into more extended exertion; and placed in such confpicuous view, that he appears to grace and adorn the station which he fills. Even in  in the silence of retirement, or in the retreat of old age, filch a man finks not into forgotten obscurity. His remembered virtues continue to be honoured, when their active exertions arc over; and to the laif stage of life he is followed by public esteem ,and respect. Whereas, if genuine worth be wanting, the applause which may have attended a man for a while, by degrees dies away. Though, for a part of his life, he had dazzled the world, this was owing to his deficiency in the essential qualities having not been suspected. As soon as the imposture is discovered, the falling flar finks in darknefs.-There is therefore a flandard of independent, intrinsic worth, to which we must bring in the end whatever claims to be honourable among men."
"By this we muff measure it; and it will always be found, that nothing but what is essential to man has power to command the refpet of man heart."
"IT is to be farther observed, that the universal content of mankind in honouring real real virtue, is sufficient to show what the SERmu genuine sense of human nature is on this iubjed. All other claims of honour are ambulatory and changeable. The degrees of respect paid to external stations vary with forms of government, and faihions of the times. Qualities which in one country are highly honoured, in another are lightly esteemed. Nay, what in some regions of the earth distinguishes a man above others, might elsewhere expose him to contempt or ridicule. But where was ever the nation on the face of the globe, who did not honour unblemished worth, unaffeced piety, stedfast, humane, and regular virtue? To whom were altars ere in the Heathen world but to those who by their merits and heroic labours, by their invention of uffful arts, or by some signal ads of beneficence to their country, or to mankind, were found worthy, in their opinion, to be tranfferred from among men, and added to the number of the gods ? Even the counterfeited appearances of virtue, which are so often found in the world, are teflimo."
"nies AERM. nies to its praise. The hypocrite knows  that, without aftuning the garb of virtue, "
"every other advantage he can possess is insufficient to procure him esteem. Interference of intercft, or perversity of difpofi."
"tion, may occasionally lead individuals to oppose, even to hate, the upright and the good. But however the charadters of such persons may be mistaken, or misrepresented, yet, as far as they are acknowledged to be virtuous, the profligate dare not traduce them. Genuine virtue has a language that speaks to every heart throughout the world."
"It is a language which is underltod by all."
"In every region, every clime, the homage paid to it is the fame. In no one sentiment were ever mankind more generally agreed."
"FINALLY, the honour acquired by religion and virtue is honour divine and immortal. It is honour, not in the eftimation of men only, but in the fight of God; whose judgement is the standard of truth and right; whose approbation confers a Erowstn frown of glory that fadeth not away. All ."
"the honour we can gain among men is li- _ mited and confined. Its circle is narrow."
"Its duration is short and transitory. But the honour which is founded on true goodness, accompanies us through the whole progress of our existence. It enters with man into a future state; and continues to brighten throughout eternal ages. What procured him refped on earth, ilall render him estimable among the great affcmbly of angels, and firits of just men made perfect; where, we are assured, they who have been eminent in righteousness fllall ine as the brightnef of the firmament, and at the Jfars for ever and ever '.-Earthly honours are both shortlived in their continuance, and, while they last, tarnished with spots and Rfains. On some quarter or other, their brightness is obscured; their exaltation is humbled. But the honour which proceeds from God, and virtue, is unmixed and pure. It is a lustre which is * Daniel xii. 3."

Whereas the honours which the world confers resemble the feeble and twinkling flame of a taper; which is often clouded by the smoke it fends forth; is always wafting; and soon dies totally away."
"LET him, therefore, who retains any sense of human dignity; who feels within him that desire of honour which is congenial to man, aspire to the gratification of this passion by methods which are worthy of his nature. Let him not reft on any of those external diftin&ions which vanity has contrived to introduce. These can procure him no more than the semblance of refpedt. Let him not be flattered by the applause which some occasional display of abilitics may have gained him. That ap* 2 Sam. xxii. 4.; Prov.  18."

"LET no one imagine that in the reli."
"gious part of this character there is any thing which carts over it a gloomy ihade, or derogates from that esteem which men are generally disposed to yield to exemplary virtues. False ideas may be entertained of religion; as false and imperfe& conceptions of virtue have often prevailed in the world."
"But to true religion there belongs no fulC 2 len BE RM. len gloom; no melancholy austerity, tend."
"-,_ - to withdraw men from human society, "
"or to diminith the exertions of active virtue. On the contrary, the religious principle, rightly understood, not only unites with all such virtues, but supports, fortifies, and confirms them. It is so far from obscuring the lustre of a character, that it heightens and ennobles it. It adds to all the moral virtues a venerable and authoritative dignity. It renders the virtuous characer more august. To the decorations of a palace, it joins the majesty of a temple."
"He who divides religion from virtue, "
"understands neither the one, nor the other."
"It is the union of the two which confummates the human character and state. It is their union which has distinguished those great and illustrious men, who have lhone with so much honour in former ages; and whose memory lives in the remembrance of succeeding generations. It is their union which forms that wisdom which is from above; that wisdom to which the text ascribes ascribes such high effects; and to which belongs the sublime encomium given of it _ by an author of one of the apocryphal books of Scripture; with whose beautiful and emphatical expreflions I conclude this discourse. bThe memorial of virtue is immortal. It is known with God, and with men."

"# SERMON  On SENSIBILITY. ROMANS, xii. 15. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."
"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."
". HE amiable spirit of our holy reli. -, . gion appears in nothing more than in the care it hath taken to enforce on men the social duties of life. This is one of the clearef charateriftics of its being a reli."
"gion whose origin is divine: For every doctrine which proceeds from the Father of mercies will undoubtedly breathe benevolence and humanity. This is the scope of the two exhortations in the text, to rejoice with them that rejoice, and to weep with them that that weep; the one calculated to promote SER ."
"the happiness, the other, to alleviate the _ sorrows of our fellow-creatures; both concurring to form that temper which interests us in the concerns of our brethren; which disposes us to feel along with them, to take part in their joys, and in their sorrows."
"This temper is known by the name of Senfibility; a word, which in modern times we hear in the mouth of every one; a quality, which every one affects to poflefs; in itself, a most amiable and worthy difpofition of mind; but often mistaken and abused; employed as a cover, sometimes, to capricious humour; sometimes, to selfish passions. I {hall endeavour to explain the nature of true sensibility. I shall confider its effects: and after tiowing its advantages, liall point out the abuses, and miftaken forms of this virtue."
"THE original constitution of our nature with respect to the mixture of selfish and social affeiions, discovers in this, as in every other part of our frame, profound and 4 admirable  admirable wisdom. Each individual is, by ip__, his Creator, committed particularly to him."
"'self, and his own care. He has it more in his power to promote his own welfare, than any other person can possibly have to prolnote it. It was therefore fit, it was neceffary, that in each individual felf-love lhould be the strongest and most active inftint."
"This felf-love, if he had been a being who flood solitary and alone, might have proved sufficient for the purpose both of his preservation, and his welfare. But such is not the situation of man. He is mixed among multitudes of the fame nature. In these multitudes, the felf-love of one man, or attention to his particular interest, encountering the felf-love and the interests of another, could not but produce frequent opposition, and innumerable mischiefs. It was necessary, therefore, to provide a counterbalance to this part of his nature; which is accordingly done, by implanting in him those social and benevolent inftinds which lead him in some measure out of himself, to follow the interest of others. The strength of of these social inflincs is, in general, "
"portioned to their importance in human life. Hence that degree of sensibility which prompts us to weep with them that weep, is stronger than that which prompts us to rejoice with them that rejoice; for this reason, that the unhappy stand more in need of our fellow-feeling and affiltance than the prosperous. Still however it was requisite; that in each individual the quantity of self."
"love should remain in a large proportion, on account of its importance to the prefervation of his life and well-being. But as the quantity requisite for this purpose is apt both to ingrofs his attention, and to carry him into criminal excesses, the perfection of his nature is measured by the due counterpoise of those social principles which, tempering the force of the selfish affection, render man equally useful to himself, and to those with whom he is joined in society. Hence the use and the value of that sensibility of which we now treat THAT it constitutes an eflential part of a religious BERM. religious character, there can be no doubt."
"Not only are the words of the text express to this purpose, but the whole New Testament abounds with passages which enjoin the cultivation of this disposition. Being all one body, and members one of another, we are commanded to love our neighbour as ourself; to look every marn not on his own things only, but on those of others also; to be pitiful, to be courteou#, to be tender-hearted; to bear ne another burdens, and so to fkjil the law of Cbr/i *. The dispositions opposite to sensibility are, cruelty, hardness of heart, contrated attachment to worldly interests; which every one will admit to be directly opposite to the Christian charater. According to the different degrees of conftitutional warmth in men affecions, sensibility may, even among the virtuous, prevail in different proportions. For all derive not from nature the fame happy delicacy, and tenderness of feeling. With some, the heart * Lukr,  27.; Philip.  4.; 1 Peter, iii. 8.; Ephef."
"iiv. 3. Galat.  ,."
"melts, and relents, in kind emotions, much more easily than with others. But with ,_ every one who aspires to the charater of a good man, it is neceflary that the humane and compaflionate dispositions should be found. There must be that within him which shall form him to feel in some degree with the heart of a brother; and when he beholds others enjoying happiness, or fees them funk in sorrow, shall bring his asfecions to accord, and, if we -may speak so, to found a note unison to theirs. This is to rejoice with them that rejoice, and to weep with them that weep. How much this temper belongs to the perfection of our nature, we learn from one who exhibited that perfection in its highest degree."
"When our Lord Jesus, on a certain occasion, came to the grave of a beloved friend, and saw his relations mourning around it, he presently caught the impreflion of their sorrow; be groaned in ]firit, and was troubled. He knew that he was about to remove the cause of their distress, by recalling Lazarus to life: Yet, in the moment RM. ment of grief, his heart sympathised with I__ theirs; and, together with the weeping friends, Yefus wept *."
"LET us next proceed to confider the esfed of this virtuous sensibility on our charater, and our state. I shall confider it in two views; its influence on our moral conduat, and its influence on our happiness."
"FIRST, it powerfully influences the proper discharge of all the relative and social duties of life. Without some discharge of those duties there could be no comfort or security in human society. Men would become hordes of savages, perpetually haraffing one another. In one way or other, therefore, the great duties of social life must he performed. There muff be among mankind some reciprocal co-operation and aid."
"In this, all consent. But let us observe, that these duties may be performed from different principles, and in different ways."
"Sometimes they are performed merely from * John,  3."
"decency decency and regard to charadter; some- "
"times from fear, and even from felfifhnefs, ,__ which obliges men to ihow kindness, in order that they may receive returns of it. In such cafcs, the exterior of fair behaviour may be preserved. But all will admit, that when from constraint only, the offices of seeming kindness are performed, little dependance can be placed on them, and little value allowed to them."
"By others, these offices are discharged solely from a principle of duty. They are men of cold affections, and perhaps of an interested characer. But, overawed by a sense of religion, and convinced that they are bound to be beneficent, they fulfil the course of relative duties with regular tenor."
"Such men act from conscience and principle. So far they do well, and are worthy of praise. They assist their friends; they give to the poor; they do justice to all. But what a different complexion is given to the fame aftions, how much higher flavour do they acquire, when they floW from the sensibility of a feeling heart ? If one ERM. one be not moved by affection, even sup."
"-_. posing him influenced by principle, he will go no farther than ftrid principle appears to require. He will advance flowly, and reluctantly. As it is justice, not generosity, which impells him, he will often feel as a talk what he is required by conscience to perform. Whereas, to him who is prompted by virtuous sensibility, every office of beneficence and humanity is a pleasure. He gives, assists, and relieves, not merely because he is bound to do so, but because it would be painful for him to refrain. Hence, the smallest benefit he confers rifes in its value, on account of its carrying the affection of the giver impressed upon the gift. It speaks his heart; and the discovery of the heart is very frequently of greater consequence than all that liberality can beitow. How often will the affectionate smile of approbation gladden the humble, and raise the dejeted? How often will the look of tender sympathy, or the tear that involuntarily falls, impart confolaton to the unhappy ? By means of this correspondence correspondence of hearts, all the great du- SER ties which we owe to one another are both _ performed to more advantage, and endeared in the performance. From true fenfibility flow a thousand good offices, apparently small in themselves, but of high impor."
"tance to the felicity of others; offices which altogether escape the observation of the cold and unfeeling, who, by the hardness of their manner, render themselves unamiable, even when they mean to do good.-How happy then would it be for mankind, if this affeAionate disposition prevailed more go-, nerally in the world! How much would the fum of public virtue and public felicity be increased, if men were always inclined to rejoice with them that rejoice, and to weep witb them that weep !"
"BUT, besides the effeCt of such a temper on general virtue and happiness, let us confider its effect on the happiness of him who poffefles it, and the various pleasures to which it gives him access. If he be maftcr of riches or influence, it affords him the  the means of increasing his own enjoy,__,^ ment, by relieving the wants, or increasing the comforts of others. If he command not these advantages, yet all the comforts which he fees in the plofeiffion of the deserving become in some fort his, by his rejoicing in the good which they enjoy."
"Even the face of nature yields a fatisfaction to him which the insensible can never know. The profusion of goodness which he beholds poured forth on the universe, dilates his heart with the thought that innumerable multitudes around him are blest and happy. When he fees the labours of men appearing to prosper, and views a country flourilhing in wealth and industry ; when he beholds the spring coming forth in its beauty, and reviving the decayed face of nature; or in autumn beholds the fields loaded with plenty, and the year crowned with all its fruits; he lifts his affections with gratitude to the great Father of all, and rejoices in the general felicity and joy."
"It may indeed be objected, that the fame sensibility sensibility lays open the heart to be pier- "
"ced with many wounds from the distresses ,_ which abound in the world; exposes us to frequent fufering from the participation which it conmmunicates of the sorrows, as well as of the joys of friendihip. But let it be confidered, that the tender melancholy of sympathy is accompanied with a fenfation, which they who feel it would not exchange for the gratifications of the felfilhb When the heart is strongly moved by any of the kind affetions, even when it pours itself forth in virtuous sorrow, a secret attractive charm mingles with the painful emotion; there is a joy in the midst of grief. Let it be farther confidered, that the griefs which sensibility intro."
"duces are counterbalanced by pleasures which flow from the fame source. Senfibility heightens in general the human powers, and is conneced with acuteness in all our feelings. If it make us more alive to tome painful sensations, in return, it renders the pleaing ones more vivid and animated. The selfish man hanguiihes in  III. his  his narrow circle of pleasures. They are _^ confined to what affects his own interet."
"He is obliged to repeat the fame gratifications, till they become insipid. But the man of virtuous sensibility moves in a wider sphere of felicity. His powers arc much more frequently called forth into occupations of plcafing aCtivity. Numberlcfs occafions open to him of indulging his favourite taltc, by conveying fatisfation to others. Often it is in his power, in one way or other, to sooth the afflicted heart; to carry some consolation into the house of woe. In the scenes of ordinary life, in the domestic and social intercourses of men, the cordiality of his affections chears and gladdens him. Every appearance, every description of innocent happiness, is enjoyed by him. Every native expression of kindness and affection among others is felt by him, even though he be not the object of it. Among a circle of friends, enjoying one another, he is as happy as the happiest."
"In a word, he lives in a different fort of world from what the selfish man inhabits."
"He He posseses a new sense, which enables him to behold objecs which the felfifih cannot fee. At the fame time, his enjoyments are not of that kind which remain merely on the surface of the mind. They penetrate the heart. They enlarge and elevate, they refine and ennoble it. To all the pleasing emotions of affection, they add the dignified consciousness of virtue.Children of men ! Men formed by nature to live and to feel as brethren ! How long will ye continue to estrange yourselves from one another by competitions and jealoufies, when in cordial union ye might be so much more blest ? How long will ye seek your happiness in felfith gratifications alone, negleding those purer and better sources of joy, which flow from the assections and the heart ?"
"HAVING now explained the nature, and shown the value and high advantages of true sensibility, I proceed to point out some of the mistaken forms, and abuses of this virtue.-- In modern times, the chief imD 2 provement  provement of which we have to boast, is a __. _sense of humanity. This, notwithltanding the felfithnels that still prevails, is the favourite and distinguishing virtue of the age."
"On general manners, and on several departments of flciety, it has had considerable influence. It has abated the spirit of perfecution: It has even tempered the horrors of war; and man is now more ashamed than he was in some former ages, of acting as a savage to man. Hence, sensibility is become so reputable a quality, that the appearance of it is frequently assumed when the reality is wanting. Softness of manners must not be mistaken for true fenfibility. Sensibility indeed tends to produce gentlcnefs in behaviour; and when such behaviour flows from native affetion, it is valuable and amiable. Bur'the exterior manner alone may be learned in the school of the world; and often, too often, is found to cover much unfeeling hardncfs of heart."
"Professions of sensibility on every trifling occasion, joined with the appearance of exceffive softness, and a profusion of sentimental mental language, afford always much "
"ground for distrust They create the sus- _ _ picion of a studied charader. Frequently, under a negligent and seemingly rough manner, there lies a tender and feeling heart. Manlinefi and sensibility are so far from being incompatible, that the truly brave are, for the most part, generous and humane; while the soft and effeminate are hardly capable of any vigorous exertion of afferion."
"As sensibility supposes delicacy of feeling with refped to others, they who asfe& the highest fen4ibility are apt to carry this delicacy to excess. They are, perhaps, not incapable of the warmth of disinterested friendihip; but they are become so refined in all, their sensations; they entertain such high notions of what ought to correspond in the feelings of others to their own; they are so mightily hurt by every thing which comes not up to their ideal standard of reciprocal affe&ion, as to produce disquiet and uneasiness to all with 3 whom  whom they are connected. Hence, unjust suspicions of their friends; hence, groundless upbraidings, and complaints of unkindness; hence, a proneness to take violent oftence at trifles. In consequence of examining their friends with a microfcopic eye, what to an ordinary observer would not be unpleafing, to them is grating and disgusting. At the bottom of the charader of such pcrfons there always lie much pride, and attention to themselves."
"This is indeed a false species of sensibility."
"It is the fubltitution of a capricious and irritable delicacy, in the room of that plain and native tenderness of heart, which prompts men to view others with indulgent eye, and to make great allowances for the imperfections which are sometimes adherent to the most amiable qualities."
"THERE are others who affect not fenfibility to this extreme, but who found high claims to themselves upon the degree of intercft which they take in the concerns of others. Although their sensibility can produce produce no benefit to the person who is its object, they always conceive that it i."
"titles themselves to some profitable returns."
"These, often, are persons of refined and artful characer; who partly deceive themselves, and partly employ their icnfibility as a cover to interest. He who acs from genuine affection, when he is feeling along with others in their joys or sorrows, thinks not of any recompence to which this gives him a title. He follows the impulse of his heart. He obeys the dictate of his nature; just as the vine by its nature produces fruit, and the fountain pours forth its freams. Wherever views of interest, and profpeAs of return, mingle with the feelings of affection, sensibility ads an impersect part, and intitles us to small fliare of praise."
"BUT supposing it to be both complete and pure, I must caution you against refting the whole merit of your character on sensibility alone. It is indeed a happy conifitution of mind. It fits men for the proD 4 per  per discharge of many duties, and gives , them access to many virtuous pleasures."
"It is requisite for our acceptance either with God or man. At the fame time, if it remain an inftinivc feeling alone, it will form no more than an imperfec charader. Complete virtue is of a more exalted and dignified nature. It supposes sensibility, good temper, and benevolent affedions; it includes them as essential parts; but it reaches farther: It supposes them to be strengthened and confirmed by principle; it requires them to be supported by justice, temperance, fortitude, and all those other virtues which enable us to with propriety, in the trying situations of life."
"It is very pofflble for a man to poflefs the kind affedions in a high degree, while, at the fame time, he is carried away by paflion and pleasure into many criminal deeds. Almost every man values himself on possessing virtue in one or other of its forms. He wishes to lay claim to some quality which will render him estimable in in his own eye, as well as in that of the SERb!"
"IL public. Hence, it is common for many, , especially for those in the higher classes of life, to take much praise to themselves on account of their sensibility, though it be, in truth, a fcnfibility of very defective kind."
"They relent at the view of misery when it is strongly set before them. Often too, affe chiefly by the powers of description, it is at feigned and pictured distress, more than at real mifery,that they relent. The tears which they ihed upon these occasions they confider as undoubted proofs of virtue. They applaud themselves for the goodness of their hearts; and conclude, that with such feelings they cannot fail to be agreeable to Heaven. At the fame time, these transient relentings make flight impreflion on conduct They give rife to few, if any, good deeds; and soon after such persons have wept at some tragical tale, they are ready to stretch forth the hand of oppression, to grasp at the gain of injustice, or to plunge into the torrent of criminal pleasures. This fort of fenfibility affords no more than a fallacious claim BERM. claim to virtue, and gives men no ground to think highly of themselves. We must inquire not merely how they feel, but how their feelings prompt them to a&, in order to ascertain their real character."
"I SHALL conclude with observing, that sensibility, when genuine and pure, has a itrong connection with piety. That warmth of affection, and tendcrnefs of heart, which lead men to feel for their brethren, and to enter into their joys and sorrows, should naturally dispose them to melt at the remembrance of the divine goodness; to glow with admiration of the divine majefty; to fend up the voice of praise and adoration to that Supreme Being who makes his creatures happy. He who pretends to great sensibility towards men, and yet has no feeling for the high objecs of religion, no heart to admire and adore the great Father of the universe, has reason to diitruft the truth and delicacy of his fenfibility. He has reason to fufpet, that in some corner of his heart there lodges a fecret cret depravity, an unnatural hardness and callousness, which vitiates his character. _ - Let us study to join all the parts of virtue in proper union; to be consistently and uniformly good; just and upright, as well as pitiful and courteous; pious, as well as sympathising. Let us pray to him who made the heart, that he would fill it with all proper dispositions; rectify all its errors; and render it the happy abode of personal integrity and social tenderness, of purity, benevolence, and devotion."
"# SERMON III. On the IMPROVEMENT of TIME. GENESIS, xlvii. 8. And Pharoob said unto Jacob, How old art thou?"
"On the IMPROVEMENT of TIME."
"GENESIS, xlvii. 8."
".nd Pharob said unto Jaob, How old art tbou 'IME is of so great importance to man _ I. kind, that it cannot too often employ religious meditation. There is nothing in the management of which wisdom is more requisite, or where mankind display their inconsistency more. In its particular parcels, they appear entirely careless of it; and throw it away with thoughtless profusion."
"But, when colleted into some of its great portions, and viewed as the measure of their continuance in life, they become fenfible sibe of its value, and begin to regard it with a serious eye. While day after day is I wafted in a course of idleness or vicious pleasures, if some incident shall occur which leads the moit inconsiderate man to think of his age, or time of life; how much of it is gone; at what period of it he is now arrived; and to what proportion of it he can with any probability look forward, as yet to come; he can hardly avoid feeling some secret compunction, and reflieing seriously upon his state. Happy, if that virtuous imprefllon were not of momenary continuance, but retained its influence amidst the succeeding cares and pleasures of the world To the good old Patriarch mentioned in the text, we have reason to believe that such impreflions were habitual. The question put to him by the Egyptian monarch produced, in his answer, such refletions as were naturally suited to his time of life. And Vacob said unto Pharaoh, tbe days of the years of my pilXrimage are an hundred and thirty years:"
"few and evil have the dayo of the years of my Ife  life been, and have not attained unto the days a__, of the years of the life of my fathers, in the days of their pilgrimage. But the peculiar circumstances of the Patriarch, or the number of his years, are not to be the subjec of our present consideration. My purpose is, to show how we should be affected in every period of human life, by reflection upon our age, whether we be young, or advanced in years; in order that the question, How old art thou ? may never be put to any of us without some good effe&."
"There are three different portions of our life which such a quetion naturally calls to view; that part of it which is pall; that which is now present; and that to which we fondly look forward, as future. Let us confider in what manner we ought to be affected by attending to each of theft."
"1. LET us review that part of our time which is past. According to the progress which we have made in the journey of life, the, field which past years present to our review will be more or less extensive. But to to every one they will be found to afford hi sufficient matter of humiliation and regret."
"For where is the perbon, who having ated for any time in the world, remembers not many errors, and many follies, in his pas behaviour ? Who dares to fay, that he has improved, as he might have done, the various advantages which were afforded him; and that he recalls nothing for which he has reason either to grieve, or to bluih ?"
"When we recolled the several stages of life through which we have passed; the fucceflive occupations in which we have been engaged, the designs we have formed, and the hopes and fears which alternately have filled our breast; how barren for most part is the remembrance; and how few traces of any thing valuable or important remain? Like characters drawn on the sand, which the next wave washes totally away, so one trivial fuccefflon of events has effaced the memory of the preceding; and though we have seemed all along to be bufy, yet for much of what we have ated, we are neither wiser nor better than if such actions ER  actions had never been. Hence, let the re_it. trofpect of what is past produce, as its first effea, humiliation in our own eyes, and abasement before God. Much do human pride and felf-complacency require some correcion; and that correction is never more effecually administered, than by an impartial and serious review of former life."
"But though past time be gone, we are not to confider it as irredeemably loft To a very profitable purpose it may yet be applied, if we lay hold of it while it remains in remembrance, and oblige it to contribute to future improvement. If you have gained nothing more by the years that are past, you have at least gained experience; and experience is the mother of wisdom. You have seen the weak parts of your character; and may have discovered the chief sources of your mifcondud. To these let your attention be directed; on these, let the proper guards be set. If you have trifled long, resolve to trifle no more. If your paslions have often betrayed and degraded you, study how they may be kept, in future, "
"under under better discipline. Learn, at the fame sE time, never to truit presumptuously in your , own wisdom. Humbly apply to the Author of your being, and beseech his grace to guide you safely through those slippery and dangerous paths, in which experience has shown that you are so ready to err, and to fall."
"In reviewing past life, it cannot but occur, that many things now appear of inconsiderable importance, which once occupied and attached uss in the highest degree. Where ate those keen competitions, those mortifying disappointments, those violent enmities, those eager purfiits, which we once thought were to last for ever, and on which we confideted our whole happinefa or misery as ffpended ? We look back upon them now, as upon a dream which has pafied away. None of those mighty consequences have followed which we had predited. The airy fabric has vanilhed, and left no trace behind it. We fmine at our former violence; and wonder how such- things could have ever appeared  III. so  significant and great. We may reft ali a_. fured, that what hath been, shall again be."
"When Time fiall once have laid his lenient hand on the paflions and pursuits of the present moment, they too shall lore that imaginary value which heated fancy now bestows upon them. Hence, let them already begin to subside to their proper level Let wisdom infuse a tinture of moderation into the eagerness of contest, by anticipating that period of coolness, which the lapse of time will, of itself, certainly bring.When we look back on years that are past, how swiftly do they appear to have fleeted away ? How insensibly has one period of life stolen upon us after another, like the successive incidents in a tale that is told ?"
"Before we were aware, childhood had grown up into youth; youth had pafred into manhood; and manhood now, perhaps, begins to assume the gray hair, and to decline into old age. When we are carrying our views forward, months and years to come seem to stretch through a long and extenfive space. But when the time flall arrive of of our looking back, they fliall appear contraded within narrow bounds. Time, when _, yet before us, seems to advance with flow and tardy steps; no sooner is it past, than we discern its wings."
"It is a remarkable peculiarity in the retrofped of former life, that it is commonly attended with some measure of heaviness of heart. Even to the most prosperous, the memory of joys that are past is accompanied with secret sorrow. In the days of former years, many objeds arise to view, which make the most unthinking, grave; and render the serious, fad. The pleafurable scenes of youth, the objects on which our affetions had been early placed, the companions and friends with whom we had spent many happy days, even the places and the occupations to which we had been long accustomed, but to which we have now bid farewell, can hardly ever be recalled, without softening, nor sometimes, without piercing, the heart. Such sensations, to which few, if any, of my hearers, are wholly strangers, I now mention, as 2 affording  affording a strong proof of that vanity of III."
"__- -. the human slate, which is so often represented in the sacred writings: And vain indeed mhft that state be, where shades of grief tinge the recollection of its brightest scenes. But, at the fame time, though it be very proper that such meditations should sometimes enter the mind, yet on them I advise not the gentle and tender heart to dwell too long. They are apt to produce a fruitless melancholy; to deje  without bringing much improvement; to thicken the gloom which already hangs over human life, without furnishing proportionable affifance to virtue."
"Let me advise you, rather to recall to vitw such parts of former condud, if any such there be, as afford in the remembrance a rational fatisfadion. And what parts of conduc are these ? Are they the purfiits of sensual pleasure, the riots of jollity, or the displays of show and vanity ? No; I appeal to your hearts, my friends, if what you recolled with most pleasure be not the innocent, the virtuous, the honourable pars of of your past life; when you were employ- "
"ed in cultivating your minds, and impro-  ving them with useful knowledge; when, by regular application and persevering labour, you were laying the foundation of future reputation and advancement; when you were occupied in discharging with sidelity the duties of your station, and acquiring the'efteem of the worthy and the good; when in some trying situation you were enabled to your part with firmness and honour; or had seized the happy opportunity of assisting the deserving, of relieving the distressed, and bringing down upon your heads the blefngs of tbo that were ready to perijh.-Thefe, these are the parts of former life which are recalled with most fatisfacdion On them alone, no heaviness of heart attends. You enjoy them as a treasure which is now stored up, and put beyond all danger of being loft. These chear the hours of sadness, lighten the burden of old age, and, through the mortifying remembrance of much of the past, dart a ray of light and joy.-From the review E3 of  of thele, and the comparison of them with _I_ the deceitful pleasures of fin, let us learn how to form our estimate of happiness. Let us learn what is true, what is false, in human pleasures; and from experience of the past, judge of the quarter to which we mufl in future turn, if we would lay a foundation for permanent fatisfaaion. Aster having thus reviewed the former years of our life, let us confider, "
"II. WHAT attention is due to that period of age in which we are at present placed."
"Here lies the immediate and principal objet of our concern. For the recollection of the pals is only as far of moment, as it ats upon the present. The pald, to us now, is little; the future, as yet, is nothing. Between there two great gulphs of time subsists the present, as an isthmus or bridge, along which we are all palsing."
"With hasty and inconsiderate steps let us not pass along it; but remember well, how much depends upon our holding a steady, and properly conducted course. Whbatocver ever thine hand findeth to do, do it pow with "
"all thy miight; for now is the accepted time; now is the day of falvatien. Many directions might be given for the wife and religious improvement of the present; a few of which only I shall hint."
"Let us begin with excluding those superfluous avocations which unprofitably confume it. Life is fiort; much that is of real importance remains to be done. If we susser the present time to be wafted either in absolute idleness, or in frivolous employments, it will hereafter call for vengeance againif us. Removing therefore what is merely fupcrfluous, let us bethink ourselves of what is most material to be attended to at present: As, first and chief, the great work of our salvation; the difcharge of the religious duties which we owe to God our Creator, and to Christ our Redeemer. God waitetb as yet to be gracious; whether he will wait longer, none of us can tell. Now, therefore, feck the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while be is near. Our spiritual interests will be 4 belt BERM. best promoted by regular performance of ,__, all the duties of ordinary lfe. Let there, "
"therefore, occupy a great share of the present hour. Whatever our age, our character, our profeflion, or station in the world, requires us to do, in that let each revolving day find us busy. Never delay till to-morrow what reason and conscience tell you ought to be performed to-day. To-morrow is not yours; and though you should live to enjoy it, you must not overload it with a burden not its own. Suficient for the day will prove the duty thereof."
"The observance of order and method, is of high consequence for the improvement of present time. He who performs every employment in its due place and season, suffers no part of time to escape without profit. He multiplies his days; for he lives much in little space. Whereas he who neglefts order in the arrangement of his occupations, is always losing the present in returning upon the palt, and trying, in vain, to recover it when gone.-Let me advise you frequently to make the present employment employment of time an object of thought. ."
"Ask yourselves, about what are you now busied? What is the ultimate scope of your present pursuits and cares ?' Can you justify them to yourselves ? Are they likely to produce any thing that will survive the moment, and bring forth some fruit for futurity? He who can give no sati factory answer to such questions as these, has reason to fufpec that his employment of the present is not tending either to hit advantage, or his honour.- Finally let me admonish you, that while you study to improve, you should endeavour also to enjoy, the present hour. Let it not be difturbed with groundless discontents, or poiboned with foolifli anxieties about what is to come: But look up to Heaven, and acknowledge, with a grateful heart, the actual blessings you enjoy. If you muff admit, that you are now in health, peace, and safety; without any particular or uncommon evils to afflict your condition; what more can you reasonably look for in this vain and uncertain world ? How little can the  the greatest prosperity add to such a Rfate?"
"Will any future situation ever make you happy, if now, with so few causes of grief, you imagine yourselves miserable? The evil lies in the (tate of your mind, not in your condition of fortune; and by no alteration of circumstances is likely to be remedied. Let us now, "
"III. CONSIDER with what dispositions we ought to look forward to those years of our life that may yet be to come. Merely to look forward to them, is what requires no admonition. Futurity is the great objet on which the imaginations of men are employed; for the fake of which the past is forgotten, and the present too often negleded. All time is in a manner swallowed up by it. On futurity, men build their designs; on futurity, they reft their hopes; and though not happy at the present, they always reckon on becoming so, at some subsequent period of their lives. This propenfity to look forward, was for wife purpofcs implanted in the human breast. It serves serves to give proper occupation to the active ."
"powers of the mind, and to quicken all its itl exertions. But it is too often immoderately indulged, and grossly abused. The curiofity which sometimes prompts persons to inquire, by unlawful methods, into what is to come, is equally foolifi and sinful."
"Let us restrain all desire of penetrating farther than is allowed us, into that dark and unknown region. Futurity belongs to God:"
"and happy for us is that mysterious veil with which wisdom has covered it."
"Were it in our power to lift up the veil, and to behold what it conceals, many and many a thorn we would plant in our breasts. The proper and rational conduc of men with regard to futurity, is regulated by two considerations: First, that much of what it contains, must remain to us absolutely unknown; next, that there are also some events in it which may be certainly known and foreseen."
"First, much of futurity is, and mutt be, entirely unknown to us. When we fpeculate  late about the continuance of our life, and _._.~ the events which are to fill it, we behold a river which is always flowing; but which soon escapes out of our fight, and is covered with mists and darkness. Some of its windings we may endeavour to trace; but it is only for a very short way that we are able to pursue them. In endless conjectures we quickly find ourselves bewildered; and, often, the next event that happens baffles all the reasonings we had formed concerning the succession of events The consequence which follows from this is, that all the anxiety about futurity, which passes the bounds of reasonable precaution, is unprofitable and vain. Certain measures are indeed necessary to be taken for our safety. We are not to rulh forward inconsiderate and headlong. We must make, as far as we are able, provision for future welfare; and guard against dangers which apparently threaten. But having done this, we must stop; and leave the reft to Him who difpofeth of futurity at his will. He who fittetb in the heavens lalgbs at at the wifiom and the plans of worldly SER men. Wherefore, boafi not tbyfif of to-mor- row; for thobu kowe nrot what a day may kring forth. For the fame reason, despair not of to-morrow; for it may bring forth good as well as evil Vex not yourselves with imaginary fears. The impending black cloud, to which you look up with so much dread, may pass by harmless; or though it should discharge the storm, yet, before it breaks, you may be lodged in that lowly mansion which no storms ever touch."
"In the next place, there are in futurity some events which may be certainly foreseen by us, through all its darkness. Sirs, it may be confidently predited, that no situation into which it will bring us, mall ever answer fully to our hopes, or confer perfet happiness. This is as certain as if we already saw it, that life, in its future periods, will continue to be what it has heretofore been; that it will be a mixed and varied state; a checquered scene of pleafuros and pains, of fugitive joys and transient  transient griefs, succeeding in a round to one another. Whether we look forward to the years of youth, or to those of man."
"hood and advanced life, it is all the fame."
"The world will be to us, what it has been to generations pall. Set out, therefore, on what remains of your journey under this persuasion. According to this measure, eftitnate your future pleasures; and calculate your future gains. Carry always along with you a modest and a temperate mind."
"Let not your expectations from the years that are to come rife too high; and your disappointments will be fewer, and more easily supported."
"Farther; this may be reckoned upon as certain, that in every future situation of life, a good conscience, a well ordered mind, and a humble trust in the favour of Heaven, will prove the essential ingredients of your happiness. In reflecting upon the past, you have found this to hold. Assure yourselves that in future, the cafe will be the fame. The principal correfives of human vanity and distress, must be fought for in religion religion and virtue. Entering on paths SS "
"which to you are new and unknown, place _ yourselves under the conduct of a divine guide. Follow the great Shepherd of lirael, who, amidst the turmoil of this world, leads his flock into green pafltures, and by the Jlill waters. As you advance in life, study to improve both in good principles, and in good practice. You will be enabled to look to futurity without fear, if, whatever it brings, it flall find you regularly employed in doing jflly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with the Lord youzr God."
"Lastly, Whatever other things may be dubious in futurity, two great events are undoubtedly certain, death and judgement."
"These, we all know, are to terminate the whole course of time; and we know them to be not only certain, but to be approaching nearer to us, in consequence of every day that passes over our heads. To these, therefore, let us look foward, not with the dread of children, but with that manly ferioufnefs which belongs to men and Chritians. Let us not avert our view from them, "
" them, as if we could place them at some   greater distance by excluding them from our thoughts. This indeed is the refuge of too many; but it is the refuge of fools, ';ho aggravate thereby the terrors they mnut encounter. For be that cometb, all come, and will not tarry. To his coming, let us look with a steady eye; and as life advances through its progressive stages, prepare for its close, and for appearing before him who made us."
"THUS I have endeavoured to point out the reflections proper to be made, when the question is put to any of us, How old art thou? I have shown with what eye we should review the past years of our life; in what light we {hould confider the present; and with what dispositions look forward to the future: In order that such a question may always leave some serious impression behind it; and may dispose usfo to number the years of our life, that we tay apply our hearts inta witfdom."

is a season; and a time to every purpose _ under heaven *.

a__rJ Piety to God, and charity to men, are incumbent upon persons of every age, as soon as they can think and  Yet these virtues, in different stages of life, assume different forms; and when they appear in that form which is most suited to our age, they appear with peculiar gracefulpefs; they give propriety to conduct, and add dignity to character. In former discourses I have treated of the virtues which adorn youth, and of the duties which specially belong to old age  The circle of those duties which refpec middle age is indeed much larger. As that is the busy period in the life of man, it includes in effect the whole compass of religion, and therefore cannot have its peculiar characer so definitely marked and ascertained. At the fame time, during those years wherein one is sensible that he has advanced beyond the confines of youth, but has not yet passed into the region of old age, there are fe* Ecclcf. li. xi. See  I. Sermons I . and 12.

veral veral things which reflection on that por-  of human life suggests, or at least _ ought to suggest, to the mind. Inconfiderate must he be, who, in his gradual progress throughout middle age, pauses not, at times, to think, how far he is now receding from youth; how near he draws to the borders of declining age; what part it is now incumbent on him to act; what duties both God and the world have a title to expect from him. To these, I am at present to call your attention; as what materially concern the greatest part of those who are now my hearers.

1. I BEGIN with observing, that the sirs duty of those who are become men is, as the text expresses it, to put away cbildi tbingr. The season of youthful levities, follies, and pamilons, is now over. These have had their reign; a reign perhaps too long; and to which a termination is certainly proper at last Much indulgence is due to youth. Many things admit of excufe then, which afterwards become unpardonable. Some things may even be   graceful in youth, which, if not criminal, 
are at Icaft ridiculous, in persons of maturer years. It is a great trial of wisdom, to make our retreat from youth with propriety; to assume the character of manhood, without cxpofing ourselves to reproach, by an unflafonablc remainder of juvenility, on the one hand, or by precise and difgufling formality, on the other.
Nature has placed certain boundaries, by which she discriminates the pleasures, actions, and employments, that are suited to the different stages of human life. It becomes us, neither to overleap those boundaries by a transition too hafly and violent; nor to hover too long on one of the limit, when nature calls us to pass over to the other.

There are particularly two things in which middle age should preserve its diftinction and efparation from youth; these are, levities of behaviour, and intemperate indulgence of pleasure. The gay spirits of the young often prompt an inconsiderate degree degree of levity, Sometimes amusing, some- sE 
times offensive; but for which, though  traying them occasionally into serious dangers, their want of experience may plead excuse. A more composed, and manly behaviour is expected in riper years. The affecation of youthful vanities, degrades the dignity of manhood; even renders its manners less agreeable; and by aukward attempts to please, produces contempt.
Chearfulnefs is becoming in every age.
But the proper chearfulnefs of a man is as different from the levity of the boy, as the flight of the eagle is from the fluttering of a sparrow in the air.

As all unseasonable returns to the levity of youth ought to be laid afide,-an admonition whith equally belongs to both the fexes,-itill more are we to guard against those intemperate indulgences of pleasure, to which the young are unhappily prone.
From these we cannot too soon retreat.
They open the path to ruin, in every period of our days. As long, however, as these excesses are confined to the first stage 3 of  of life, hope is left, that when this fever of  the spirits shall abate, sobriety may gain the ascendant, and wiser counsels have power to influence conduct. But after the season of youth is palt, if its intemperate fpirit remain; if, inflead of listening to the calls of honour, and bending attention to the cares, and the business of men, the fame course of idleness and sensuality continue to be pursued, the cafe becomes more desperate. A fad presumption arifes, that long immaturity is to prevail; and that the pleasures and passions of the youth are to fink and overwhelm the man.
Difficult, I confess, it may prove to overcome the attachments which youthful habits had for a long while been forming. Hard, at the beginning, is the talk, to impose on our conduct restraints which are altogether unaccufRomed and new. But this is a trial which every one mull undergo, in entering on new fcencs of ation, and new periods of life. Let those who are in this situation bethink themfelvcs, that all is now at flake. Their character and honour, their future future fortune and success in the world, 
depend in a great measure on the fleps they 
take, when first they appear on the stage of adcive life. The world then looks to them with observing eye. It studies their behaviour; and interprets all their motions, as presages of the line of future conduc which they mean to hold. Now, therefore, put away cbildib Ibings; dismiss your former trifling anufements, and youthful pleasures; blast not the hopes which your friends are willing to conceive of you.
Higher occupations, more serious cares, await you. Turn your mind to the steady and vigorous discharge of the part you are called to a&. This leads me,   To point out the particular duties which open on those who are in the middle period of life. They are now come forward to that field of ation where they are to mix in all the stir and bustle of the world; where all the human powers are brought forth into full exercise; where all all that is conceived to be important in huF 4 man  man affairs is incessantly going on around ,.__ them. The time of youth was the prepation for future ation. In old age our active part is supposed to be finiihed, and reft is permitted. Middle age is the season when we are expected to display the fruits which education had prepared and ripened. In this world, all of us were formed to be asfiltants to one another. The wants of society call for every man labour, and require various departments to be filled up.
They require that some be appointed to rule, and others to obey; some, to defend the society from danger, others to maintain its internal order and peace; some, to provide the conveniencies of life, others to promote the improvement of the mind; many, to work; others to contrive and direA. In short, within the sphere of society there is employment for every one; and in the course of these employments, many a moral duty is to be performed; many a religious grace to be exercised. No one is permitted to be a mere blank in the world.
No rank, nor station, no dignity of birth, 
nor nor extent of possessions, exempt any man from contributing his mharc to public uti- _.
lity and good. This is the precept of God.
This is the voice of nature. This is the just demand of the human race upon one another.

One of the first questions, therefore, 
which every man who is in the vigour of his age should put to himself is,  What am I doing in this world ? What have I yet done, whereby I may glorify God,  and be useful to my fellows ? Do I pro perly fill up the place which belongs to ' my rank and station ? Will any memo' rial remain of my having existed on the  earth ? or are my days pafling fruitless away, now when I might be of some importance in the system of human affairs ?"
"-Let not any man imagine that he is of no importance, and has, upon that account, a privilege to trifle with his days at pleasure. Talents have been give to all; to some, ten; to others, five; to others, two. Occupy with tbefe * till I come, is the Luke, xix. 13."
"command MI. command of the great Master to all. Where  , fiuperior abilities are poffeflfd, or diftinguiflhed advantages of fortune are enjoyed, a wider range is afforded for useful exertion, and the world is intitled to expec it."
"But among those who fill up the inferior departments of society, though the sphere of usefulness be more contraced, no one is left entirely insignificant. Let us remember, that in all stations and conditions, the important relations take place, of mafiers or fcrvants, husbands and wives, parents and children, brothers and friends, citizens and fubjeAs. The discharge of the duties ariiing from those various relations, forms a great portion of the work assigned to the middle age of man. Though the part we have to aa may be confined within a humble line, yet if it be honourably a  it will be always found to carry its own reward."
"In fine, industry, in all its virtuous forms, ought to inspirit and invigorate manhood. This will add to it both satisfaction facion and dignity; will make the current ER "
"of our years, as they roll, flow along in a clear and equable fiream, without the putrid stagnation of sloth and idleness. Idleness is the great corrupter of youth; and the bane and dishonour of middle age. He who, in the prime of life, finds time to hang heavy on his hands, may with much reason suspect, that he has not consulted the duties which the consideration of his age imposed upon him; assuredly he has not consulted his own halpinefs. But amidst all the bustle of the world, let us not forget, "
"III. To guard with vigilance againrt the peculiar dangers which attend the period of middle life. It is much to be regretted, that in the present state of things there is no period of man age in which his virtue is not exposed to perils. Pleasure lays its snares for youth: and after the season of youthful follies is past, other temptations, no less formidable to virtue, presently arise."
"The  The love of pleasure is succeeded by the ,_. palion for interest. In this passion the whole mind is too often absorbed; and the change thereby induced on the character is of no amiable kind. Amidst the excesses of youth, virtuous affections often remain."
"The attachments of friendihip, the love of honour, and the warmth of sensibility, give a degree of lustre to the character, and cover many a failing. But interest, when it is become the ruling principle, both debases the mind, and hardens the heart. It deadens the feeling of every thing that is sublime or refined. It contracts the affections within a narrow circle; and extinguishes all those sparks of generosity and tenderness which once glowed in the breast."
"In proportion as worldly pursuits multiply, and competitions rife, ambition, jealoufy, and envy, combine with interest to excite bad passions, and to increase the corruption of the heart. At first, perhaps, it was a man intention to advance himself in the world by none but fair and laudable methods. He retained for some time an aver- "
"'sion to whatever appeared dithonourable.  "
"But here, he is encountered by the violence of an enemy. There, he is supplanted by the address of a rival. The pride of a fuperior insults him. The ingratitude of a friend provokes him. Animofities ruffle his temper. Suspicions poison his mind."
"He finds, or imagines that he finds, the artful and designing surrounding him on every hand. He views corruption and iniquity prevailing; the modest neglected; the forward and the crafty rising to diftinction. Too easily, from the example of others, he learns that mystery of vice, called the way of the world. What he has learned he fancies necessary to pracfife for his own defence; and of course assumes that fipple and versatile charader, which he observes to be frequent, and which often has appeared to him successful."
"To ihefe, and many more dangers of the fame kind, is the man exposed who is deeply engaged in ative life. No finall degree of  of firmness in religious principle, and of ,__ constancy in virtue, is requisite, in order to prevent his being aflimilated to the spirit of the world, and carried away by the multi."
"tude of evil doers. Let him therefore call to mind those principles which ought to fortify him against such temptations to vice."
"Let him often recollec that, whatever his station in life may be, he is a man; he is a Christian. These are the chief characters which he has to support; characters fuperior far, if they be supported with dignity, to any of the titles with which courts can decorate him; superior to all that can be acquired in the strife of a busy world. Let him think, that though it may be desireable to increase his opulence, or to advance his rank, yet what he ought to hold much more sacred is, to maintain his integrity and honour. If these be forfeited, wealth or station will have few charms left. They will not be able to protect him long from finking into contempt in the eye of an observing world. Even to his own eye he will will at last appear base and wretched.-  Let not the affairs of the world entirely 1V."
"gross his time and thoughts. From that contagious air which he breaths in the midit of it, let him sometimes retreat into the salutary shade consecrated to devotion and to wisdom. There, converting seriously with his own foul, and looking up to the Father of spirits, let him study to calm those unquiet passions, and to redify those internal disorders, which intercourse with the world had excited and increaied. In order to render this medicine of the mind more effectual, it will be highly proper, "
"IV. THAT as we advance in the course of years, we often attend to the lapse of time and life, and to the revolutions which these are ever effecting. In this meditation, one of the first reflections which should occur is, how much we owe to that God who hath hitherto helped us; who hath brought us on so far in life; hath guided BERM. guided us through the slippery paths of 1V. youth, and now enables us to flourifi in the strength of manhood. Look back, my friends, to those who started along with yourselves in the race of life. Think how many of them have fallen around you."
"Observe how many blank spaces you can number in the catalogue of those who were once your companions. If, in the midst of so much devastation, you have been preserved and blessed; confider seriously what returns you owe to the goodness of Heaven. Inquire whether your condua has corresponded to these obligations; whether, in public and in private, you have honoured, as became you, the God of your fathers; and whether, amidfl the unknown occurrences that are yet before you, you have ground to hopl for the continued protection of the Almighty."
"Bring to mind the various revolutions which you have beheld in human affairs, since you became acors on this busy theatre. Refle& on the changes which have taken place in men and manners, in.opinions nions and customs, in private fortunes, and  "
"in public conduct. By the observations _ you have made on these, and the experience you have gained, have you improved proportionably in wisdom ? Have the changes of the world which you have witneffed, loosened all unreasonable attachment to it? Have they taught you this great lesson, that, while the fahion of the world is ever pasing away, only in God and in virtue, stability is to be found ? Of great use, amidst the whirl of the world, are such pauses as these in life; such refting places of thought and reflection; whence we can calmly and deliberately look back on the past, and anticipate the future."
"To the future, we are often casting an eager eye, and fondly storing it, in our imagination, with nany a pleasing scene."
"But if we would look to it, like wife men, let it be under the persuasion that it is nearly to resemble the past, in bringing forward a mixture of alternate hopes and fears, of griefs and joys. In order to be Prepared for whatever it may bring, let us  III. cultivate GE RM. cultivate that manly fortitude of mind, ,_2^ which, supported by a pious trust in God, "
"will enable us to encounter properly the vicissitudes of our tlate. No quality is more necessary than this, to them who are pasing through that stormy season of life of which we now treat. Softness and esfeminacy, let them leave to the young and unexperienced, who are amusing themselves with florid profpeas of bli  But to those who are now engaged in the middle of their course, who are supposed to be well acquainted with the world, and to know that they have to struggle in it with va."
"rious hardIhips, firmness, vigour, and resolution, are dispositions more fuitabie."
"They must buckle on well this armour of the mind, if they would issue forth into the contest with any profpe of success.While we thus study to correC the errors, and to provide againit the dangers, which are peculiar to this stage of life, "
"V, LAY foundation for comfort in old age."
"age. That is a period which all expect and hope to fee; and to which, amidil the toils I_ of the world, men sometimes look forward, not without satisfaction, as to the period of retreat and reft. But let them not deceive themselves. A joyless and dreary season it will prove, if they arrive at it with an unimproved, or corrupted mind. For old age, as for every other thing, a certain preparation is requisite; and that preparation conifts chiefly in three particulars; in the acquisition of knowledge, of friends, of virtue. There is an acquisition of another kind, of which it is altogether needless for me to give any recommendation, that of riches. But though this, by many, will be esteemed a more material acquisition than all the three I have named, it be confidently pronounced, that, without these other requisites, all the wealth we can lay up in store will prove insufficient for making our latter days pais smoothly away."
"First, He who wishes to render his old age comfortable, should iudy betimes to 2 enlarge *"
" enlarge and improve his mind; and by Â»  thought and inquiry, by reading and reflecing, to acquire a taste for useful knowledge. This will provide for him a great and noble entertainment, when other entertainments leave him. If he bring into the solitary retreat of age a vacant, uninformed mind, where no knowledge dawns, where no ideas rile, which has nothing to feed upon within itself, many a heavy and comfortless day he must necessarily pass.Next, When a man declines into the vale of years, he depends more on the aid of his friends, than in any other period of his life. Then is the time, when he would especially with to find himself surrounded by some who love and respect him; who will bear with his infirmities, relieve him of his labours, and chear him with their society. Let him, therefore, now, in the 'Tummer of his days, while :yet active and fouriihing, by aCs of feafofable kindness and beneficence cnfure that love, and by -upright and honourable conduc lay fountlation for that reflecd, which in old age he 4 he would wiih to enjoy.-In the last place, "
"Let him confider a good conscience, peace ,__ with God, and the hope of heaven, as the molt effectual consolations he can possess, when the eil days thall come, wherein, otherwise, he is likely to find little pleasure. It is not merely by transient ats of devotion that such consolations are to be provided. The regular tenor of a virtuous and pious life, spent in the faithful discharge of all the duties of our ftation, will prove the best preparation for old age, for death, and for immortality."
"AMONG the measures thus taken for the latter scenes of lifei let me admonish every one not to forget to put his worldly affairs in order, in due time. This is a duty which he owes to his characer, to his family, or to those, whoever they be, that are to succeed him; but a duty too often unwisely delayed, from a childilh aversion to entertain any thoughts of quitting the world. Let him not trufi much to what he will do in his old age. Sufficient for  3 that  that day, if he shall live to fee it, will be _,_, the burden thereof. It has been remarked, that as men advance in years, they care less to think of death. Perhaps it occurs oftener to the thoughts of the young, than of the old. Feebleness of' spirit renders melancholy ideas more oppreflive; and after having been so long accustomed and inured to the world, men bear worse with any thing which reminds them that they must soon part with it.-However, as to part with it is the doom of all, let us take measures betimes for going off the flage, when it mhall be our turn to withdraw, with decency and propriety; leaving nothing unfulfilled which it is expedient to have done before we die. To live long, ought not to be our favourite wish, so much as to live well. By continuing too long on earth, we might only live to witness a greater number of melancholy scenes, and to expose ourfclves to a wider compass of human woe. He who has served his generation faithfully in the world, has duly honoured God, and been beneficent and useful useful to mankind; he who in his life has "
"been refpeted and beloved; whose death _ is accompanied with the sincere regret of all who knew him, and whose memory is honoured; that man has sufficiently fulfilled his course, whether it was appointed by Providence to be long or short. For honourable age is not that which flandetb in length of time, nor that which is measured by number of years; but wJfdom is the gray hair to man; and an unspotted life is old age *."

"# SERMON  On DEATH. ECCLESIASTES, xii. 5. Â— Man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets."
"ECCLESTASTES, Xii. 5."
"- Man goetb to bis long home, and the mourners go about the Jrceets."
"SEVRM. HIS is a fight which incessantly preI ents itself. Our eyes are so much accustomed to it, that it hardly makes any impression. Throughout every season of the year, and during the course of almost every day, the funerals which pals along the streets show us man going to bis long bone. Were death a rare and uncommon objeCt; were it only once in the course of a man life, that he beheld one of his fellow-creatures carried to the grave, a solemn awe awe would fill him; he would flop flort in SERM the midst of luis plcafures; he would even aV be chilled with fecrct horror. Such impref."
"'sions, however, would prove unsuitable to the nature of our preient flare. When they became so strong as to render men unfit for the ordinary business of life, they would in a great measure defeat the intention of our being placed in this world. It is better ordered by thc wisdom of Providence, that they lhould be weakened by the frequency of their recurrence; and so tempered by the mixture of other passions, as to allow us to go on freely in acting our parts on earth."
"Yet, familiar as death is now become, it is undoubtedly fit, that by an event of so important a nature, some imprelion should be made upon our minds. It ought not to pass over, as one of those common incidents which are beheld without concern, and a."
"waken no reflecion. There are many things which the funerals of our fellow-creatures are calculated to teach; and happy it were for the gay and dissipated, if they would liften rE RM. liften mote frequently to the inftrudions of so awful a monitor. In the context, the wife man had described, under a variety of images suited to the eastern style, the growing infirmities of old age, until they arrive it that period which concludes them all; when, as he beautifully expresses it, the filver cord being loosened, and the golden bowl broken, the pitcher being broken at the fountain, and the wheel at the cistern, man goeth to bis long home, and the mourners go about tbeJreett. In discoursing from these words, it is not my purpose to treat, at present, of the infiruaiona to be drawn from the prosped of our own death. I am to confine myself to the death of others; to confider death as one of the molt frequent and confiderable events that happen in the course of human: affairs; and to show in what manner.we ought to be affected, first, by the death of firangers, or indifferent persons; secondly, by the death of friends; and thirdly, by the death of enemies."
"I. BY the death of indifferent persons; "
"if if any can be called indifferent, to whom ."
"we are so nearly allied as brethren by nature, and brethren in mortality. When we observe the funerals that pars along the streets, or when we walk among the monuments of death, the first thing that naturally strikes us is the undiftinguifhing blow, with which that common enemy levels all. We behold a great promiscuous multitude all carried to the fame abode; all lodged in the fame dark and silent mansions. There, mingle persons of every age and character, of every rank and condition in life; the young and the old, the poor and the rich, the gay and the grave, the renowned and the ignoble. A few weeks ago, most of those whom we have seen carried to the grave, walked about as we do now on the earth; enjoyed their friends, beheld the light of the fun, and were forming designs for future days. Perhaps, it is not long since they were engaged in scenes of high festivity. For them, perhaps, the cheerful company assembled; and in the midst of the circle they shone with gay and pleasing  pleasing vivacity. But now-to them, all is ' finally closed. To them, no more flall the seasons return, or the fun arise. No more ihall thcy hear the voice of mirth, or behold the face of man. They are swept from the univcrfe, as though they had never been."
"They are carried away as with a flood: The wind has paged over them, and they are gone."
"When we contemplate this desolation of the human race; this final termination of fb many hopes; this silence that now reigns among those who, a little while ago, were to busy, or so gay; who can avoid being xouched with sensations at once awful and tender i What heart but then warms with the glow of humanity ? In whose eye does not the tear gather, on revolving the fate of passing and ihortlived man ? Such sensations are so congenial to human nature, that they are attended with a certain kind of sorrowful pleasure. Even voluptuaries themselves, sometimes indulge a taste for funereal melancholy. After the festive assembly is difmifTld, they chufe to walk retired in the shady grove, and to contemplate the venerable fcpulchrcs of their ancestors. This melancholy melancholy pleasure arises from two differ- "
"ent sentiments meeting at the fame time in  the breast; a sympathetic sense of the shortness and vanity of life, and a persuasion that something exists after death; sentiments, which unite at the view of the honfe appointed for all living. A tomb, it has been justly said, is a monument situated on the confines of both worlds. It, at once, presents to us the termination of the inquietudes of life, and sets before us the image of eternal reft bere, in the elegant expressions of Job, the wicked ce.fe from troubling; and there the weary be at ref. There the prisoners ref together; they hear not the voice ofthe opprefor. Thefmall and the great are there; and the servant is free from his mafler. It is very remarkable, that in all languages, and among all nations, death has been described in a style of this kind; expressed by figures of speech, which convey every where the fame idea of reft, or sleep, or retreat from the evils of life. Such a style perfestly agrees with the general belief of the foul inSmortality; but assuredly . conveys  conveys no high idea of the boasted pleaV. fures of the world. It. hows how much all mankind have felt this life to be a fccne of trouble and care; and have agreed in opinion, that perfect reft is to be expected only in the grave."
"There, fays Job, are the finall and the great. There, the poor man lays down at lat the burden of hiswearifome life. No more shall he groan under the load of poverty and toil. No more fall he hear the insolent calls of the master, from whom he received his scanty wages. No more shall he be raised from needful number on his bed of straw, nor be hurried away from his homely meal, to undergo the repeated labours of the day. While his humble grave is preparing, and a few poor and decayed neighbours are carrying him thither, it is good for us to think, that this man too was our brother; that for him the aged and deftitute wife, and the needy children now weep; that, neglected as he was by the world, he possessed perhaps both a found understanding, and a worthy heart; and is now now carried by angels to reft in Abraham "
"bofom.-At no great distance from him, the . grave is opened to receive the rich and proud man. For, as it is said with emphasis in the parable, the rich man al died, and war buried*. He a died. His riches prevented not his sharing the fame fate with the poor man; perhaps, through luxury, they accelerated his doom. Then, indeed, the mourners go about the Jreets; and while, in all the pomp and magnificence of woe, his funeral is prepared, his heirs, in the mean time, impatient to examine his will, are looking on one another with jealous eyes, and already beginning to quarrel about the division of his fubftance.-One day, we fee carried along the coffin of the frniling infant; the flower just nipped as it began to blossom in the parents view: and the next day, we behold the young man, or young woman, of blooming form and promising hopes, laid in an untimely grave. While the funeral is attended by a numerous, unconcerned  concerned company, who are discoursing  to one another about the news of the day, "
"or the ordinary affairs of life, let our thoughts rather follow to the house of mourning, and represent to themselves what is going on there. There, we would fee a disconsolate family, fitting in silent grief, thinking of the fad breach that is made in their little society; and, with tears in their eyes, looking to the chamber that is now left vacant, and to every memorial that presents itself of their departed friend. By such attention to the woes of others, the selfish hardness of our hearts will be gradually softened, and melted down into humanity."
"Another day, we follow to the grave one who, in old age, and after a long career of life, has in full maturity funk at last into reft. As we are going along to the mansion of the dead, it is natural for us to think, and to discourse, of all the changes which such a person has seen during the course of his life. He has pafled, it is likely, through varieties of fortune. He has has experienced prosperity, and adversity. "
"He has seen families and kindreds rife and fall. He has seen peace and war succeeding in their turns; the face of his country undergoing many alterations; and the very city in which he dwelt riling, in a manner, new around him. After all he has beheld, his eyes are now closed for ever."
"He was becoming a stranger in the midst of a new fucceflion of men. A race who knew him not, had arisen to fill the earth."
"Thus passes the world away. Throughout all ranks and conditions, one generation passeth, and another generation cometh; and this great inn is by turns evacuated, and replenished, by troops of succeeding pilgrims."
"--0 vain and inconflant world! 0 fleeting and transient life ! When will die sons of men learn to think of thee, as they ought? When will they learn humanity from the aflictions of their brethren; or moderation and wisdom, from the sense of their own fugitive state ?-But, now to come nearer to ourselves, let us, "
"VOL. III.  CON  CONSIDER the death of our friends."
"V. Want of reflection, or the long habits, either of a very busy, or a very dissipated life, may have rendered men insensible to all such objects as I have now described. The firanger, and the unknown, fall utterly unnoticed at their  Life proceeds with them in its usual train, without being asfe by events in which they take no personal concern. But the dissolution of those ties which had long bound men together, in intimate and familiar union, gives a painful thock to every heart. When a family, who, for years, had been living in comfort and peace, are suddenly flattered by some of their most beloved or refpe members being torn from them; when the hutband or the spouse are separated for ever from the companion who, amidst every viciflitude of fortune, solaced their life; ho had ihared all their joys, and participated in all their lorrows; when the weeping parent is folding in his arms the dying !:lid whom he tenderly loved; when he is giving his laht blessing, receiving the last lat fond adieu, looking for the last time SE "
"on that countenance, now wafting and fa- .ded, which he had once beheld with much delight; then is the time, when the heart is made to drink all the bitterness of human woe.-But I seek not to wound your feelings by dwelling on there fad defcrip."
"rions. Let us rather turn our thoughts to the manner in which such events ought to be received and improved, since happen they mult in the life of man."
"Then, indeed, is the time to weep. Let not a false idea of fortitude, or mistaken conceptions of religious duty, be employed to restrain the bursting emotion. Let the heart seek its relief, in the free effusion of just and natural sorrow. It is becoming in every one to show, on such occasions, that he feels, as a man ought to feel. At the fame time, let moderation temper the grief of a good man and a Christian. He mull not sorrow like tbofe who have no bhpe. As high elation of spirits befits not the joys, so continued and overwhelming dejection suits not the griefs of this tranitory world."
"E RM. Grief, when it goes beyond certain bounds, , becomes unmanly; when it lasts beyond a certain time, becomes unseasonable. Let him not reject the alleviation which time brings to all the wounds of the heart, but susser excessive grief to subside, by degrees, into a tender and affectionate remembrance. Let him confider, that it is in the power of Providence to raise him up other comforts in the place of those he has loft."
"Or, if his mind, at present, rejed the thoughts of fuicY consolation, let it turn for relief to the profpet of a future meeting in a happier world. This is indeed the chief soother of affliction; the most powerful balm of the bleeding heart. It affilts us to view death, as no more than a temporary separation of friends. They whom we have loved still live, though not present to us. They are only removed into a different mansion in the house of the common Father. The toils of their pilgrimage are finished; and they are gone to the land of reft and peace. They are gone from this dark and troubled world, "
"to to join the great aflcmbly of the just; and to dwell in the midst of everlasting light. _, In due time we hope to be associated with them in these blissful habitations. Until this season of re-union arrive, no principle of religion discourages our holding corre1pondence of affecion with them by means of faith and hope."
"Meanwhile, let us refpec the virtues, "
"and cherifl the memory, of the deceased."
"Let their little failings be now forgotten."
"Let us dwell on what waiamiable in their charater, imitate their worth, and trace their steps. By this means, the remembrance of those whom we loved shall become useful and improving to us, as well as sacred and dear; if we accustom ourselves to confider them as Rill speaking, and exhorting us to all that is good; if, in situations where our virtue is tried, we call up their refpe'ted idea to view, and, as placed in their presence, think of the part which we could ac before them without a blush."
"Moreover, let the remembrance of the 3 friends  friends whom we have loft, strengthen our  affection to those that remain. The narrower the circle becomes of those we love, let us draw the closer together. Let the heart that has been softened by sorrow, mellow into gentleness and kindness; make liberal allowance for the weaknesses of others; and divest itself of the little prejudices that may have formerly prepossessed it against them. The greater havock that death has made among our friends on earth, let us cultivate connecion more with God, and heaven, and virtue. Let those noble views which man immortal charaCter affords, fill and exalt our minds."
"Passengers only through this sublunary region, let our thoughts often ascend to that divine country, which we are taught to confider as the native feat of the foul."
"Thcre, we form conneCtions that are never broken. There, we meet with friends who never die. Among celestial things there is firm and lasting constancy, while all that is on earth changes and passes away.- Such are some of the fruits we should {hould reap from the tender feelings ex- "
"cited by the death of friends. But they  are not only our friends who die. Our enemies also must go to their long home."
"Let us, therefore, "
"III. CONSIDER how we ought to be asfe  when they from whom fulpicions have alienated, or rivalry has divided us; they with whom we have long contended, or by whom we imagine ourselves to have suffered wrong, are laid, or about to be laid, in the grave. How inconsiderable then appear those broils in which we had been long involved, those contefis and feuds which we thought were to last for ever ? The awful moment that now terminates them, makes us feel their vanity."
"If there be a spark of humanity left in the breast, the remembrance of our common fate then awakens it. Is there a man, who, if he were admitted to stand by the deathbed of his bitterest enemy, and beheld him enduring that conflic which human nature muf fuiffer at the last, would not be 4 inclini '"
"M. inclined to stretch forth the hand of friend."
"V  ship, to utter the voice of forgiveness, and to wish for perfet reconciliation with him before he left the world? Who is there that, when he beholds the remains of his adversary deposited in the dutl, feels not, in that moment, some relentings at the remembrance of those par animofities which mutually embittered their life ?- There  lies the man with whom I contended so  long, silent and mute for ever. He is  fallen; and I am about to follow him."
" How poor is the advantage which I now enjoy ? Where are the fruits of all our  contels ? In a short time we shall be laid together; and no remembrance remain of either of us, under the fun."
"How many mistakes may there have  been between us ? Had not he his virtues and good qualities, as well as I ?

When we fliall both appear before the  judgement-feat of God, flall I be found innocent, and free of blame, for all the enmnity I have borne to him ?- My friends, let the anticipation of fich sentiments, serve now to correc the inveteracy ."
"of prejudice, to cool the heat of anger, to "
"allay the fierceness of resentment. How unnatural is it for animofities so lasting to possess the hearts of mortal men, that nothing can extinguish them, but the cold hand of death ? Is there not a sufficient proportion of evils in the flort span of human life, that we seek to increase their number, by ruffling into unneccffary contefls with one another ? When a few funs more have rolled over our heads, friends and foes shall have retreated together; and their love and their hatred be equally buried. Let our few days, then, be spent in peace. While we are all journeying onwards to death, let us rather bear one another burdens, than harass one another by the way. Let us smooth and chear the road as much as we can, rather than fill the valley of our pilgrimage with the hateful monuments of our contention and strife."
"Tnus I have set before you some of those . those meditations which are naturally fug _ gested by the prevalence of death around us; by the death of firangers, of friends, and of enemies. Because topics of this nature are obvious, let it not be thought that they are without use. They require to be recalled, repeated, and enforced. Moral and religious inftrusion derives its efficacy, not so much from what men are taught to know, as from what they are brought to feel. It is not the dormant knowledge of any truths,. but the vivid impreflion of them, which has influence on practice."
"Neither let it be thought, that such meditations are unseasonable intrusions upon those who are living in health, in affluence, and ease. There is no hazard of their making too deep or painful an impression. The gloom which they occasion is transient; and will soon, too soon, it is probable, be difpelled by the succeeding affairs and pleafurcs of the world. To wisdom it certainly belongs, that men should be impresscd with just views of their nature, and their state: and the pleasures of life will always be be enjoyed to most advantage when they are tempered with serious thought.

"SERFR. HOUGH human nature be now fallen lT_ .
1 from its original honour, several good principles still remain in the hearts of men.
There are few, if any, on whose minds the reverence for a Supreme Being continues not, in some degree, impressed. In every breast, some benevolent affetions are found; and confciencc still retains a sense of the liftindion between moral good and evil.
These principles of virtue are always susceptible of improvement; and, in favourable able situations, might have a happy 
fluence on praceice. But filch is the frail- __ ty of our nature, and so numerous are the temptations to evil, that they are in perpetual hazard of being either totally effaced, or so far weakened as to produce no effect on conducd. They are good feeds originally sown in the heart; but which require culture, in order to make them rife to any maturity. If left without afliftance, they are likely to be stifled by that profusion of noxious weeds which the foil fends forth around them.

Among the numerous causes which introduce corruption into the heart, and accelerate its growth, none is more unhappily powerful than that which is pointed out in the text, under the description of evil communications; that is, the contagion which is diffused by bad examples, and heightened by particular connections with persons of loose principles, or dissolute morals. This, in a licentious slate of society, is the most common source of those vices and disorders which so much abound in great cities; 
and aE  and often proves, in particular manner, fa_ tal to the young; even to them whose beginnings were once auspicious and promising. It may therefore be an useful employment of attention, to trace the progreif of this principle of corruption; to examine the means by which evil communications gradually undermine, and at last destroy good manners, or (which here is the proper fignification of the original word) goad morals.
It is indeed disagreeable to contemplate human nature, in this downward course of its progress. But it is always profitable to know our own infirmities and dangers.
The consideration of them will lead me to suggest some of the means proper to be ufed, for preventing the mischiefs arising from evil communications.

AGREEABLY to what I observed of certain virtuous principles being inherent in human nature, there are few but who set out at first on the world with good difpofitions. The warmth which belongs to youth naturally exerts itself in generous feelings, 
and and sentiments of honour; in firong at- 


tachment to friends, and the other emo- _, tions of a kind and tender heart. Almost all the plans with which persons who have been liberally educated begin the world, are connected with honourable views. At that period, they repudiate whatever is mean or base. It is pleasing to them to think, of commanding the esteem of those among whom they live, and of acquiring a name among men. But alas! how soon does this flattering prafp begin to be overcast!
Desires of pleafire usher in temptation, and forward the growth of disorderly paflions.
Nlinifters of vice are seldom wanting to encourage, and flatter, the palfions of the young. Inferiors study to creep into favour, by servile obfequioufnefi to all their desires and humours. Glad to find any apology for the indulgences of which they are fond, the young too readily liften to the voice of those who suggest to them, that ftricl notions of religion, order, and virtue, are old faihioned and illiberal; that the restraints which they impose are only fit  fit to be prescribed to those who are in the  first stage of pupillage; or to be preached to the vulgar, who ought to be kept within the closest bounds of regularity and subjection. But the goodness of their hearts, it is insinuated to them, and the liberality of their views, will fully justify their emancipating themselves, in some degree, from the rigid discipline of parents and teachers.

Soothing as such infmuations are to the youthful, and inconsiderate, their first steps, however, in vice, are cautious and timid, and occasionally checked by remorse. As they begin to mingle more in the world, and emerge into the circles of gaiety and pleasure, finding these loose ideas countenanced by too general pratice, they gradually become bolder in the liberties they take. If they have been bred to business, they begin to tire of industry, and look with contempt on the plodding race of citizens. If they be of superior rank, they think it becomes them to resemble their equals; to assume that freedom of behaviour, that air of forwardness, that tone of dissipation, 
dissipation, that easy negligence of those with whom they converse, which appear ,1.
faihionable in high life. If affluence of fortune unhappily concur to favour their inclinations, amusements and diversions succeed in a perpetual round; night and day are confounded; gaming fills up their vacant intervals; they live wholly in public places; they run into many degrees of excess, disagreeable even to themselves, merely from weak complaisance, and the fear of being ridiculed by their loose associates.
Among these associates, the most hardened and determined always take the lead. The reft follow them with implicit submission; and make proficiency in this school of iniquity, in exa& proportion to the weakness of their understandings, and the strength of their passions.

How many pais away, after this manner, 
some of the most valuable years of their life, toft in a whirlpool of what cannot be called pleasure, so much as mere giddinefi and folly ? In the habits of perpetual connection with idle or licentious company,   III. I all  all reflection is loft; while, circulated fromt Vl.
 one empty head, and one thoughtlefit heart, 
to another, folly shoots up into all its molt ridiculous forms; prompts the extravagant, unmeaning frolic in private; or sallies forth in public into mad riot; impelled sometimes by intoxication, sometimes by mere levity of spirits..

All the while, amidst this whole course of juvenile infatuation, I readily admit, that much good nature may fill remain. Generofity and attachments may be found; nay, some awe of religion may lill subsist, and fime remains of those good imprefflons which were made upon the mind in early days. It might yet be very poflible to rcclaim such persons, and to form them for useful and refpecable flations in the world, if virtuous and improving focicty lhould happily 'ucceed to the place of that idle crew with whom they now associate; if important bufmefs should occur, to bring them into a different sphere of acion; or, if some fealbnable stroke of afflition should in mercy be sent, to recall them to themcelves, and to awaken fcrioui annl manly seReM.
thought. But, if youth and vigour, and _.
flowing fortune continue; if a similar sicceflion of companions go on to ainmfe them, to ingrofs their time, and to Flir up their passions; the day of ruin,-lct them take heed, and beware !-the day of irrecoverable ruin, begins to draw nigh. Fortune is squandered; health is broken; friends are offended, affronted, ellranged; aged parents, perhaps, sent afflicted and mourning, to the dust.

There are certain degrees of vice which arc chiefly stamped with the characer of the ridiculous, and the contemptible: and there are also certain limits, beyond which if it pass, it becomes odious and execrable. If, to other corruptions which the heart has already received, be added the infusion of sceptical principles, that worst of all the evil communicationm of finners, the whole of morals is then on the point of being overthrown. For, every crime can then be palliated to conscience; every'check and restraint which had hitherto remained, 
1 2 is  is taken away. He who, in the beginning _1 _ of his courte, soothed himself with the thought, that while he indulged his defires, he did hurt to no man; now, pressed by the neceflity of supplying those wants into which his expensive pleasures have brought him, goes on without remorse to defraud, and to oppress. The lover of pleasure, now becomes hardened and cruel; violates his trust, or betrays his friend; becomes a man of treachery, or a man of blood; satisfying, or at least endeavouring all the while to satisfy himfeif, that circumstances form his excuse; that by necessity he is impelled; and that, in gratifying the passions which nature had implanted within him, he does no more than follow nature.

Miserable and deluded man! to wi. art thou come at the last? Dost thou pretend to follow nature, when thou art contemning the laws of the God of nature?
when thou art Itifling his voice within thee, which remonltrates against thy crimes?
when thou art violating the belt part of thy nature, by counteracing the dicates of of justice and humanity? Dost thou fol- 
low nature, when thou rendereft thyself an _1 useless animal on the earth; and not useless only, but noxious to the society to which thou belongeft, and to which thou art a disgrace; noxious, by the bad example thou haft set; noxious, by the crimes thou haft committed; sacrificing innocence to thy guilty pleasures, and introducing flame and ruin into the habitations of peace; defrauding of their due the unfufpicious who have trusted thee; involving in the ruins of thy fortune many a worthy family; reducing the industrious and the aged to misery and want; by all which, if thou haft escaped the deserved sword ofjuftice, thou halt at least brought on thylelf the resentment, and the reproach of all the respectable and the worthy.-Tremble then at the view of the gulph which is opening before thee. Look with horror at the precipice, on the brink of which thou standeft: and if yet a moment be left for rctreat, think how thou mayst escape, and be saved.

I 3 Tils  Tins brings me to what I proposed 

- as the next head of discourse; to suggest some means that may be used for stopping in time the progress of such mischiefs; to point out some remedies against the fatal infection of evil communications.

THE first and most obvious is, to withdraw from all associations with bad men, with persons either of licentious principles, or of disorderly condut. I have shown to what ifue such dangerous connections are apt to bring men at lat. Nothing, therefore, is of more importance for the young, to whom I now chiefly address myself, than to be careful in the choice of their friends and companions. This choice is too frequently made without much thought, or is determined by some casual connection; and yet, very often, the whole fate of their future life depends upon it. The circumstances which chiefly attract the liking and the friendship of youth, are vivacity, good humour, engaging manners, and a cheerful or easy temper; qualities, I confess, ariabible miable in themselves, and useful and va- 


luable in their place. But I intreat you to , remember, that there are not all the qualities requisite to form an intimate companion or friend. Something more is still to he looked for; a found understanding, a steady mind, a firm attachment to principle, to virtue, and honour. As only solid bodies polish well, it is only on the subftantial ground of these manly endowments, that the other amiable qualities can receive their proper lustre. Destitute of these esfential requisites, they ihine with no more than a tinsel brilliancy. It may sparkle for a little, amidst a few circles of the frivolous, and superficial; but it imposes not on the discernment of the public. The world in general seldom, after a short trial, judges amiss of the characers of men. You may be assured, that its charater of you will be formed by the company you frequent; and how agreeable soever they may ieem to be, if nothing is to be found among them but hollow qualities, and external accomplifmments, they soon fall down into the class, 
I 4 at  at best, of the insignificant, perhaps of the .' worthless; and you fink of course, in the opinion of the public, into the fame defpicable rank.

Allow me to warn you, that the most gay and pleasing, are sometimes the most insidious and dangerous companions; an admonition which refpeds both the sexes.
Often they attach themselves to you from interested motives; and if any taint or fufpicion lie on their characer, under the cover of your rank, your fortune, or your good reputation, they seek protection for themselves. Look round you, then, with attentive eye, and weigh characters well before you conned yourselves too closely with any who court your society. He that walketb with wife men a/ll be wis ; but a companion of fools Jball be deflrored. Wherefore, enter not thou into the counsel of the scorner. Walk not in the way with evil men; avoid it; pafi not by it, turn from it, and pass away *.

*Prov. xiii. 20.; Prov . . 14.

IN IN order to prevent the influence of evil 
communications, it is farther needful, that aj_ you fix to yourselves certain principles of conduct, and be resolvcd and determined on no occasion to swerve from them. Setting the consideration of religion and virtue aside, and attending merely to interest and reputation, it will be found, that he who enters on active life without having ascertained some regular plan, according to which he is to guide himself, will be unprosperous in the whole of his subsequent progress. But when conduct is viewed in a moral and religious light, the effeft of having fixed no principles of action; of having formed no laudable standard of character, becomes more obviously fatal'
For hence it is, that the young and thoughtless imbibe so readily the poison of evil communications, and fall a prey to every feducer. They have no internal guide whom they are accustomed to follow and obey; nothing within themselves, that can give firmness to their condu They are of course the vicims of momentary inclination or caprice;    caprice ; religious and good by flarts, 
., when, during the absence of temptation and tempters, the virtuous principle stirs within them ; but never long the fame; changing and fluctuating according to the passion that chances to rife, or the inftigation of thole with whom they have connected themfclves. They are failing on a dangerous sea, which abounds with rocks; without compass, by which to direct their course, or helm, by which to guide the veffel. Whereas, if they acted on a system, if their behaviour made it appear that they were determined to conduct themselves by certain rules and principles, not only would they escape innumerable dangers, but they would command reljied from the licentious themfelvcs. Evil doers would cease to lay their fiares for one whom they saw moving above them, in a higher iphere, and with a more steady course.

As a farther corrective of evil communications, and as a foundation to those principles which you lay down for conduct, 
let let me advise you sometimes to think fe- 


rioufly, of what contlitutes real enjoyment _ and happiness. Your days cannot be entirely spent in company and pleasure.
How closely soever you are surrounded and besieged by evil companions, there must be some intervals, in which you are left by yourselves; when, after all the turbulence of amusement is over, your mind will naturally assume a graver and more pensive cast These are precious intervals to you, if you knew their value. Seize that fober hour of retirement and silence. Indulge the meditations which then begin to rife.
Cast your eye backwards on what is past of your life; look forward to what is probably to come. Think of the part you are now acting; and of what remains to be ated, perhaps to be suffered, before you die. Then is the time to form your plans of happiness, not merely for the next day, but for the general course of your life.
Remember, that what is pleasing to you at twenty, will not be equally so at forty or fifty years of age; and that what continues longef  longest pleasing, is always most valuable. a Recolled your own feelings in different fcenep of life. Inquire on what occasions you have felt the truest fatisfalion; whether days of sobriety, and rational employment, have not left behind them a more agreeable remembrance, than nights of licentioueiefs and riot. Look round you on the world; reflec on the different focieties which have fallen under your obfervation; and think who among them appear to enjoy life to most advantage; whether they who, encircled by gay companions, are constantly fatiguing themselves in quest of pleasure; or they to whom pleasure comes unsought, in the course of an ative, virtuous, and manly life. Compare together these two claffcs of mankind, and aik your own hearts, to which of them you would chufe to belong. If, in a happy moment, the light of truth begin to break in upon you, refuse not admittance to the ray. If your hearts lecretly reproach you for the wrong choice you have made, bethink yourselves that the evil is not not irreparable Srill llerc is time for 
pentance and retreat; and a return to wis- dom, is always honourable.

Were such meditations often indulged, 
the evil comalnications of finners would die away before the i; the force of their poison would evaporate; the world would begin to assume in your eyes a new form and shape. Disdain not, in these solitary hours, to recolled what the wisest have lsid, and have written, concerning human happincfs, and humarn vanity. Treat not theit opinions, as effusions merely of peeviihnefs or disappointment: but believe theni to be, What they truly are, the result of long experience, and thorough acquaintmace with the world. Confider that the leafon of youth is passing fait away. It is time for you to be taking measures for an establishment in life; nay, it were wife to be looking forward to a placid enjoyment of old age. That is a period you wish to fee; but how miserable when it arrives, if it yield you nothing but the dregs of life; and present no retrdfped, 
except  except that of a thoughtless, and difioVL__ noured youth!

LET me once more advise you, to look forward sometimes beyond old age; to look to a future world. Amidst evil communications, let your belief, and your character as Christians, arise to your view. Think of the sacred name in which you were baptized. Think of the God whom your fathers honoured and worihipped; of the religion in which they trained you up; of the venerable rites in which they brought you to partake. Their paternal cares have now ceased. They have finished their earthly course: and the time is coming when you must follow them. You know that you are not to live always here; and you surely do not believe that your existence is to end with this life. Into what world then are you next to go ? Whom will you meet with there ? Before whose tribunal are you to appear ? What account will you be able to give of your present trifling and irregular conduCt to him who made made you ?-Such thoughts may be treat-  as unseasonable intrusions. But intrude 
they sometimes will, whether you make them welcome or not. Better then, to allow them free reception when they come, and to confider fairly to what they lead.
You have seen persons die; at least, you have heard of your friends dying near you.
Did it never enter into your minds, to think what their last reflections probably were in their concluding moments; or what your own, in such a situation, would be ? What would be then your hopes and fears; what part you would then wish to have acted; in what light your closing eyes would then view this life, and this world ?

These are thoughts, my friends, too important to be always excluded. These are things too solemn and awful to be trifled with. They are superior to all the ridicule of fools. They come home to every man bosom; and are intitled to every man highest attention. Let us regard them as becomes reasonable and mortal creatures; 
and . and they will prove effectual antidotes to ^ the evil communications of petulant scoffers."
"When vice or folly arise to tempt us under flattering forms, let the serious character which we bear as men come also forward to view; and let the solemn admonitions, with which I conclude, found full in our ears: My Jon, if inners entice thee, consent tbou not. Come out from amongj)"

"Such is the real situation of man in this world; and he who flatters himself with an opposite view of his slate, only lives in the paradise of fools."
"In this situation, no quality is more requifite than constancy, or fortitude of mind; a quality which the Psalmist appears, from the sentiment in the text, to have pofirfcfe in an eminent degree. Fortitude was justly classed by the ancient philosophers, among the cardinal virtues."
"It is indeed essential to the support of them all; and is molt necessary to be acquired by every one who wifles to discharge with fidelity the duties of his tation. It is the armour of the mind, which will fit hin for encountering the trials, and surmounting the dangers, that are likely to occur in the course of his life. It may be thought, "

Though, partly, it is io, vet experience ihows that it may also be acquired by principle, and be fortified by realbn ; and it is only when thuls acquired, and thus fortitied, at it can be accounted to carry the characer of virtue. Fortitude is opposcd, as all know, to timidity, ilrcliolution, a feeble and a wavering spirit. It is placed, like other virtues, in the middle between two cxtrcmes ; tanding at an equal diltance from rallnelc on the one hand, and from puiillanimity on the other. In difiourfing on this fuljeict, I purlpolc, firl, to flow the importance of fortitude or conflancv; next, to afccrtain the grounds on which it mult reft; and, latl  to fuiggif ioime confidera tions for affiffing the exercile of it."
"I. THIE high importance of fortitude will cafily appear, if we coniider it as refpeting either the happinels of human life, or the proper :!ifch:rge of its dutics."
"K 2 Without  Without some degree of fortitude there ,VL. can be no happincs  bccanfe, amridft the thousand uncertainties of life, there can be no enjoyment of tranquillity. The man of feeble and timorous spirit, lives under perpetual alarms. He foresees every distant danger, and trembles. He explores the regions of pofTibility, to discover the dangers that may arilc. Often lie creates imaginary ones; always magnifies those that are real."
"Hence, like a person haunted by speares, he loies the free enjoyment even of a fife and 1rofpcrous tate. On the firflt hock of adversity, he dcifonds. Inltead of exerting himself to lay hold on the resources that remain, he gives up all for loft; and resigns himfclf to abject and broken spirits."
"-On the other hand, firmness of mind is the parent of tranquillity. It enables one to enjoy the prelent without dilturbance; and to look calmly on dangers that approach, or evils that threaten in future. It fuggeits good hopes. It supplies resources."
"It allows a man to retain the full poffefiion of himself, in every situation of fortune."
"Look into the heart of this man, and you will will find compofiure, cheerfulness, and mag- SS. RM."
"nanimity. Look into the heart of the other, "
"and you will fee nothing but confusion, anxiety, and trepidation. The one is the cattle built on a rock, which defies the attacks of surrounding waters. The other is a hut placed on the shore, which every wind lhakes, and every wave overflows."
"IF fortitude be thus essential to the enjoyment of life, it is equally so, to the proper diTcharge of all its most important duties."
"He who is of a cowardly mind is, and must be, a slave to the world. He fashions his whole conduc according to its hopes and fears. He smiles, and fawns, and betrays, from abjec considerations of personal safety. He is incapable of either conceiving, or executing, any great design. He can neither fland the clamour of the multitude, nor the frowns of the mighty. The wind of popular favour, or the threats of power, are sufficient to {hake his molt determined purpose. The world always knows where to find him. He may pretend 3 to  to have prinlciplcs; blit on every trying ocL^^_ claionl, it will he lCeen, that his pretended principles Iendl to convenience and fafcty."
"-hTc man of virtuous fortitude, again, follows the dictatcs of his heart, uncmbarrafled by those restraints which lie upon the timorous. I laving once detcrmined what is fit for him to do, no threatenings can flake, nor dangcrs appall him. He rclts upon himself, fipported by a conIcioulcfis of inward dignity.

After having long aaed as the apostle of the Gentiles, his miflion called him to go to Jerusalem, where he knew that he was to encounter the utmost violence of his enemies. Just before he set fail, he called together the elders of his favourite church at Ephesus, and in a pathetic speech, which does great honour to his characer, gave them his last farewel."

"A corrupted and guilty man, can poflefs no true firmness of heart. He who by crooked paths, purfucs dishonourable ends, has many things to dismay him. He not only dreads the difappointlrent of his designs, by some of those accidents to which all are exposed; but lie has alol to dread the treachery of his confederates, the difcovery and reproach of the world, and the ' Job xxvii. 5. 6."
"just  just difpleafire of Heaven. His fears he is obliged to conceal; but while he assumes the appearance of intrepidity before the world, he trembles within himnfelf; and the bold and steady eye of integrity, frequently darts terror into his heart. There is, it is true, a fort of conltitutional courage, which sometimes has rendered men daring in the molt flagitious attempts."
"But this fool-hardiness of the ralh, this bol(lnefs of the ruffian, is altogether different from real fortitude. It arises merely from warmth of blood, from want of thought, and blindness to danger. As it forms no character of value, so it appears only in occasional sallies; and never can be nniformily maintained. It requires adventitious props to lipport it; and in some hour of trial, always fails. There can be no true courage, no regular persevering conltancy, but what is connected with principle, and founded on a consciousness of rectitude of intention. This, and this only, erects that brazen wall which we can oppose to every hostile attack. It cloaths us us with an armour, on which fortune will "

A good conscience, thus supported, bestows on the heart a much greater degree of intrepidity, than it could otherwise inspire. One who reils on an Almighty, though invisible, Protector, exerts his powers with double force; ads with vigour not his own. Accordingly, it was from this principle of trust in God, that the Psalmist derived that courage and boldness, which he expresses in the text. He had said immediately before, The Lord is my light and my salvation; the Lord it the Jretigth of my life. The consequence which diredly follows is, of whom jhall I be afraid ? Though an hoJt Jhould encamp againt me, my heart Jhall not frar. It remains, "
"III. THAT I fuggedt a few considerations which may prove auxiliary to the exercise of of virtuous fortitude, in the midst of dan- "
"gers. From what was just now said, it appears, "
"first, that it is of high importance to every one who wifles to aa his part with "
"coming resolution, to cultivate a religious principle, and to be inspired with trust in God. The imperfections of the best are indeed so numerous, as to give them no title to claim, on their own account, the protection of Heaven. But we are taught to believe, that the merciful God, who made us, and who knows our frame, favours the sincere and upright; that the supreme administration of the universe is always on the of truth and virtue; and, that, therefore, every worthy character, and every just and good cause, though for a while it mhould be depressed, is likely to receive countenance and proteCtion in the end."
"The more firmly this belief is rooted in the heart, its influence will be more powerful, in surmounting the fears which arise from a sense of our own weakness or danger. The records of all nations afford a thousand  thousand remarkable initances of the es. fed of this principle, both on individuals, "
"and on bodies of men. Animated by the strong belief of a just cause, and a protcding God, the feeble have waxed Jlrong, and have despised dangers, sufferings, and death. Handfuls of men have defied bojis that were encamped agaitql them ; and have gone forth, conquering and to conquer. The fuword of the Lord, and of Gideon, have called forth a valour which afionifhed the world; and which could have been exerted by none, but those who fought under a divine banner."
"IN the next place, let him who would preserve fortitude in difficult situations, fill his mind with a sense, of what constitutes the true honour of man. It consists not in the multitude of riches, or the elevation of rank; for experience Ihows, that these may be possessed by the worthless, as well as by the deserving. It consists, in being deterred by no danger when duty calls us forth; in fulfilling our allotted part, whatever it may be, "
"be, with faithfulness, bravery, and "
"ftancy of mind. These qualities never fail ."
"to stamp diftilnction on the character. They confer on him who discovers them, an honourable fuperlority, which all, even enemies, feel and revere. Let every man, therefore, when the hour of danger comes, bethink himself, that now is arrived the hour of trial; the hour which must determine whether he is to rife, or to fink for ever, in the eftcem of all around him. If, when put to the test, he discover no firmness to maintain his ground, no fortitude to stand a flock, he has forfeited every pretension to a manly mind. He mull reckon on being exposed to general contempt; and what is worse, he will feel that he deserves it. In his own eves he will be contemptible; than which, lurely, no mifery can be more severe."
"BUT in order to acquire habits of fortitude, what is of the highest consequence is, to have formed a just estimate of the goods and evils of life, and of the value of life BERM. life itself. For here lies the chief Iburce of Â»^_^ our weakness and pusillanimity. We overvalue the advantages of fortune; rank and riches, cafe and iifety. Deluded by vain opinions, we look to theye as our ultimate goods. We hang upon them with fond attachment; and to forfeit any hope of ancement, to incur the least discredit with the world, or to be brought down but one ftep from the fiation we possess, is regarded with consternation and dismay. Hence, a thousand weights hang upon the mind, which depress its courage, and bend it to mean and diflionourable compliances. What fortitude can he poffels, what worthy or generous purpose can he form, who conceives diminution of rank, or loss of fortune, to be the chief evils which man can susser? Put these into the balance with true honour, with conscious integrity, with the esteem of the virtuous and the wife, with the favour of Almighty God, with peace of mind, and hope of heaven; and then think, whether those dreaded evils are sufficient to intimidate you from doing your your duty. Look beyond external appear- "
"ances to the inside of things. Suffer not _ yourselves to be impoied by that glittering varnish, with which the surface of the world dazzles the vulgar. Confider how many are contented and happy without those advantages of fortune, on which you put so extravagant a value. Confider whether it is poifible for you to be happy with them, if, for their fake, you forfeit all that is effimabe in man. The favour of the great, perhaps, you think, is at flake; or that popularity with the multitude, on which you build plans of advancement."
"Alas! how precarious are the means which you employ in order to attain the end you have in view; and the end itself, how little is it worthy of your ambition ? That fa~"
"your which you pursue, of dubious advantage when gained, is frequently loft by servile compliance. The timid and abjeA are deteted, and despised even by those whom they court; while the firm and resolute rife in the end to those honours%"
"which the other pursued in vain."
" PUT the cafe at the wori. Suppose not _.~.2. your fortune only, but your safety, to be in hazard; your life itself to be endangered, by adhering to conscience and virtue. Think, what a creeping and ignominious state you would render life, if, when your duty calls, you would expose it to no danger; if by a dastardly behaviour, you would, at any expence, preserve it."
"That life, which you are so anxious to preserve, can at any rate be prolonged only for a few years more; and those years may be full of woe. He who will not rilk death when conscience requires him to face it, ought to be aihamed to live.- Confider, as a man and a Christian, for what purpose life was given thee by Heaven. Was it, that thou mighteft pass a few years in low pleasures, and ignoble sloth; flying into every corner to hide thyself, when the least danger rifes to view ? No: Life was given, that thou mighteft come forth to some useful and honourable part, on that theatre where thou haft been placed by Providence; mighteft glorify him that made thee; "
"thee; and by steady perseverance in virtue, "
"rife in the end to an immortal state. ,_ Son of man! Remember thine original honours. Aflert the dignity of thy nature."
"Shake off this pusillanimous dread of death; and seek to fulfil the ends for which thou wert sent forth by thy Creator.--The sentiment of a noble mind is, Icount not my life dear unto miyef, Jo that I may fini#"
"my courfi with joy. To the fini/bing of bi course, let every one direc his eye; and let him now appretiate life according to the value it will be found to have, when fummed up at the close. That is the period which brings every thing to the tet. Illusions may formerly have imposed on the world; may have imposed on the man himself. But all illusion then vanishes. The real characer comes forth. The estimate of happiness is fairly formed. Hence it has been justly said, that no man can be pronounced either great or happy, until his last hour come. To that last hour, what will bring such fatisfadion, or add so much dignity, as the refletion, on having furL 2 mounted mounted with firmness all the discourageVII."
"ments of the world, and having persevered to the end in one uniform course of fidelity and honour? We remarked before, the magnanimous behaviour of the Apostle Paul, when he had persecution and distress full in view. Hear now the sentiments of the fame great man, when the time of his last suffering approached; and remark the majesty, and the ease, with which he looked on death. I am now ready to be oered, and the time  my departure is at hand. I have fougbt the good jfgt. I have finihed my courie. I have kept the faith. Hencefortb tbher is laid up for me a crown of rightovfitJf *. How many years of life does such a dying moment overbalance ? Who would not chute, in this manner, to go off the stage, with such a song of triumph in his mouth, rather than prolong his existence through a wretched old age, stained with fin and hame ?"
"* Timothy,  6. 7."
"ANIMATED ANIMATED by these considerations, let SEP:."
"us nourish that fortitude of mind, which is  so essential to a man, and a Christian. Let no discouragement, nor danger, deter us from doing what is right. Through honour and dijonour, through good report and bad report, let us preserve fidelity to our God and our Saviour. hbough an hofiboutid encamp againfi us, let us not fear to difcharge our duty. God assists us in the virtuous conflid; and will crown the conqueror with eternal rewards. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. To kim that overcometb, faith our bless."

"# SERMON  On ENVY. 1 CORINTHIANS, xiii. 4. Charity envieth not. Â—"
"I CORINTHIANS, xiu. 4, "
"Charity enviet not."
"BERM. NVY is a sensation of uneasiness  Jj and disquiet, arising from the advantages which others are supposed to possess above us, accompanied with malignity towards those who possess them."
"This is universally admitted to be one of the blackest paflions in the human heart."
"In this world, we depend much on on2 another; and were therefore formed by Cod to be mutually iufeful and afifting."
"The inftinds of kindness and compafion which belong to our frame, Ihow how much much it was the intention of our Creator, ."
"that we should be united in friendfliip. If vilI."
"any infringe this great law of nature, by ads of causeless hostility, resentment may justly arise. No one is to be condemned for defending his rights, and ihowing difpleasure against a malicious enemy. But to conceive ill-will at one who has attacked none of our rights, nor done us any injury, solely because he is more prosperous than we are, is a disposition altogether unnatural; it suits not the human conftitution, and partakes more of the rancour of an evil spirit. Hence, the charader of an envious man is universally odious. All difclaim it; and they who feel themselves under the influence of this paflion, carefully conceal it."
"But it is proper to confider, that among all our paflions, both good and bad, there are many different gradations. Sometimes they swim on the surface of the mind, without producing any internal agitation."
"They proceed no farther than the beginnings of passion. Allayed by our conftiE  tution, or tempered by the mixture of other  dispositions, they exert no considerable influence on the temper. Though the charater in which envy forms the ruling passion, and reigns in all its force, be one too odious, I hope, to be common; yet some shade, some tincture, of this evil difpofition, mixes with molf characters in the world. It is, perhaps, one of the mot prevailing infirmities to which we are subjeCt."
"There are few but who, at one time or other, have found somewhat of this nature stirring within them; some lurking uneafinest in their mind, when they looked up to others, who enjoyed a greater share than had fallen to their lot, of some advantages which they wilhed, and thought themselves intitled, to possess. Though this should not embitter their disposition; though it should create the uncafinefs only, without the malignity, of envy; yet still it is a difturbcd Itate of mind; and always borders upon, if it actually include not, some vicious affections. In order, as far as poffible, to remedy this evil, I hall now con."
"fider fider what are the most general grounds of SERM VIIL the envy which men are apt to bear to others; and shall examine what foundation they afford, for any degree of this troublesome and dangerous paffion.-The chief grounds of envy may be reduced to three:"
"Accomplihmnents of mind; advantages of birth, rank, and fortune; superior fuccefi in worldly pursuits."
"I. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, or endowments of the mind. The chief endowment for which man deserves to be valued, is virtue."
"This, unquestionably, forms the most effimable distinction among mankind. Yet this, which may appear surprising, never forms any ground of envy. No man is envied for being more just, more generous, more patient, or forgiving, than others."
"This may, in part, be owing to virtue producing in every one who beholds it, that high degree of refped and love, which extingnifhes envy. But probably, it is more owing to the good opinion which every one entertains of his own moral qualities."
"Some SE tM. Some virtues, or, at least, the feeds of them, "
"he finds within his breait. Others, he vainly attributes to himself. Those in which he is plainly deficient, he undervalues; as either not real virtues, or virtues of very inferior rank; and relts satisfied, that, on the whole, he is as worthy and refpedtable as his neighbour."
"The cafe is different, with regard to those mental abilities and powers which are afcribed to others. As long as these are exerted in a sphere of action remote from ours, and not brought into competition with talents of the fame kind, to which we have pretensions, they create no jealousy."
"They are viewed as distant objects, in which we have not any concern. It is not until they touch our own line, and appear to rival us in what we wish to excel, that they awaken envy. Even then, envy is, properly speaking, not grounded on the talents of others. For here, too, our selfcomplacency brings us relief; from the persuasion, that were we thoroughly known, and full justice done to us, our abilities would would be found not inferior to those of our rivals. What properly occasions envy, "
"is the fruit of the accomplishments of others; the pre-eminence which the opinion of the world bestows, or which we dread it will bestow, on their talents above ours. Hence, distinguished superiority in genius, learning, eloquence, or any other of those various arts that attract the notice of the world, often become painful grounds of envy; not indeed to all indifferently, but to those who follow the fame line of pursuit. Mere rivality, inspired by emulation, would carry no reproach; were not that rivality joined with obliquity, and a malignant spirit; did it not lead to fecret detraction, and unfair methods of diminifhing the reputation of others. Too frequently has such a spirit tarnished the charater of those who fought to shine in the elegant arts; and who, otherwise, had a just title to fame.-Let such as are addided to this infirmity confider, how much they degrade themselves. Superior merit, of any kind, always refts on itself. Confcious sERM. fciou of what it deserves, it disdains low  _, competitions and jealousies. They who are itung with envy, especially when they allow its malignity to appear, confess a sense of their own inferiority; and, in effec, pay homage to that merit from which they endeavour to detract But in order to eradicate the pafion, "
"and to cure the disquiet which it creates, let such persons farther confider, how inconsiderable the advantage is which their rivals have gained, by any superiority over them. They whom you envy, are themselves inferior to others who. follow the fame pursuits. For how few, how very few, have reached the summit of excellence, in the art or study which they cultivate? Even that degree of excellence which they have attained, how eldom is it allowed to them by the world, till after they die ? Public applause is the mot fluctuating, and uncertain, of all rewards. Admired, as they may be, by a circle of their friends, they have to look up to others, who (land above them in public opinion; "
"and and undergo the fame mortifications which ER "
"you susser in looking up to them. ."
"fider what labour it has cost them to arrive at that degree of eminence they have gained; and after all their labour, how imp perfect their recompence is at lait. Within what narrow bounds is their fame confined? With what a number of humiliations is it mixed ? To how many are they absolutely unknown? Among those who know them, how many cenfire and decry them ?- Attending fairly to these confi."
"derations, the envious might come in the end to discern, that the fame acquired by anv accompliihment of the mind, by all that {kill can contrive, or genius can execute, amounts to no more than a small elevation; raises the polfeffor to such an inconsiderable height above the crowd, that others may, without disquiet, fit down contented with their own mediocrity."
"II. ADVANTAGES of fortune, superiority in birth; rank and riches, even qualificaions of body and form, become grounds of  of envy. Among external advantages, "
"-vm. those which relate to the body ought certainly, in the comparative estimation of ourselves and others, to hold the lowest place; as in the acquisition of them we can claim no merit, but must ascribe them entirely to the gift of nature. Yet envy has often Ihowed itself here in full malignity; though a small measure of reflection might have discovered, that there was little or no ground for this paflion to arise. It would have proved a blessing to multitudes, to have wanted those advantages for which they are envied. How frequently, for instance, has Beauty betrayed the poffeffors of it into many a snare, and brought upon them many a disaster ? Beheld with spiteful eyes by those who are their rivals, they, in the mean time, glow with no less envy against others by whom they are furpassed; while, in the midst of their competitions, jealousies, and concealed enmities, the fading flower is easily blasted; Ihortlived at the best; and trifling, at any rate, "
"rate, in comparison with the higher, and  more lasting beauties of the mind. VIn."
"But of all the grounds of envy among men, superiority in rank and fortune is the most general. Hence, the malignity which the poor commonly bear to the rich, as ingroffing to themselves all the comforts of life. Hence, the evil eye with which pcrfons of inferior station scrutinise those who are above them in rank; and if they approach to that rank, their envy is generally strongest against such as are just one ftep higher than themfelves.-Alas ! my friends, all this envious disquietude, which agitates the world, arises from a deceitful figure which imposes on the public view."
"False colours are hung out: the real state of men is not, what it seems to be. The order of society requires a diftintion of ranks to take place; but in point of happiness, all men come much nearer to equality than is commonly imagined; and the circumstances, which form any material difference of happiness among them, are not of that nature which renders them grounds of BERM. of envy. The poor man polfetles not, it is true, some of the conveniencies and pleasures of the rich; but, in return, he is free of many embarrassments to which they are fubjeft. By the simplicity and uniformity of his life, he is delivered from that variety of cares, which perplex those who have great affairs to manage, intricate plans to pursue, many enemies, perhaps, to encounter in the pursuit. In the tranquillity of his small habitation, and private family, he enjoys a peace which is often unknown at courts. The gratifications of nature, which are always the most satisfafory, are possessed by him to their full extent; and if he be a firanger to the refined pleasures of the wealthy, he is unacquainted also with the desire of them, and by consequence, feels no want. His plain meal satisfies his appetite, with a relifh, probably, higher than that of the rich man, who fits down to his luxurious banquet. His sleep is more found; his health more firm; he knows not what spleen, languor, or liitleffnefs are, His accustomed employments or labours are not more oppressive to him, than the labour of at- __ tendance on courts and the great, the labours of dress, the fatigue of amusements, the very weight of idleness, frequently are to the rich. In the mean time, all the beauty of the face of nature, all the enjoyments of domestic society, all the gaiety and chearfulnefs of an easy mind, are as open to him as to those of the highest rank. The splendour of retinue, the found of titles, the appearances of high refpeA, are indeed soothing, for a short time, to the great. But become familiar, they are soon forgotten. Custom effaces their impreflion. They fink into the rank of those ordinary things, which daily recur, without raising any sensation of joy.-Ceafe, therefore, from looking up with discontent and envy to those whom birth or fortune have placed above you. Adjust the balance of happiness fairly. When you think of tie enjoyments you want, think also of the troubles from which you are free. Allow their just value to the comforts you pofVOL. III. fess; "

"III. SUPERIOR success in the course of worldly pursuits, is a frequent ground of envy. Among all ranks of men, competitions arise. Wherever any favourite objed is pursued in common, jealousies feldom fail to take place among those who are equally desirous of attaining it; as in that ancient instance of envy recorded of Jgfeph brethren, who bated their brather, because tbeir father loved him more than all te ref *. .

 titled by his birth or his rank. But  when I, and another, have flarted in the  race of life, upon equal terms, and in the fame rank; that he, without any pretension to uncommon merit, should  have suddenly so far outfiripped me; "
"Ihould have ingroffed all that public faÂ· vour to which I am no less intitled than  he; this is, what I cannot bear; my  blood boils, my spirit swells with indignation, at this undeserved treatment I  have suffered from the world. Complaints of this nature are often made, by them who seek to juffify the envy which they bear to their more prosperous neighbours. But if such persons with not to be thought unjust, let me desire them to inquire, whether they have been altogether fair in the comparison they have made of their own merit with that of their rivals; and whether they have not themselves to blame, more than the world, for being left behind in the career of fortune. The world M2 is . is not always blind or unjust, in conferring V1_.
' its favours. InRances indeed, sometimes, 
occur, of deserving persons prevented, by a fuccellion of crois incidents, from rising into public acceptance. But, in the ordinary course of things, merit, sooner or later, receives a reward; while the greater part of men misfortunes and disappointments can, generally, be traced to some mifcondua of their own. Wldlom bringeth to honour:
The band of the diligent makctb rich; and, it has been said, not altogether without rcason, that, of his own fortune in life, every man is the chief artificer. If Joseph was preferred by the father to all his brethren, his subsequent condut ihowed how well he merited the preference.

Supposing, however, the world to have.

been unjust, in an uncommon degree, with regard to you, this will not vindicate malignity and envy towards a more profperous competitor. You may accuse the world; but what reason have you to bear ill-will to him, who has only improved the favour which the world lhowed him ? If, 
by by means that are unfair, he has risen; 
and, to advance himself, has ated inju-  
rioufly by you, resentment is justifiable; but if you cannot accuse him of any fucl improper conduct, his success alone gives no fandion to your envy. You, perhaps, preferred the enjoyment of your cafe, to the stir of a busy, or to the cares of a thoughtful life. Retired from the world, and following your favourite inclinations, you were not always attentive to seize the opportunities which offered, for doing justice to your character, and improving your fituation. Ought you then to complain, if the more active and laborious have acquired what you were negligent to gain ? Confider, that if you have obtained less preferment, you have possessed more indulgence and ease. Confider, moreover, that the rival to whom you look up with repining eyes, though more fortunate in the world, may perhaps, on the whole, not be more happy than you. He has all the viciffi.
tudes of the world before him. He may have much to encounter, much to susser,  3 fiuil RM. from which you are protected by the great . er obscurity of your station. Every fituation in life, has both a bright and a dark  Let not your attention dwell only on what is bright on the of those you envy, and dark on your own. But bringing into view both fides of your refpeftive conditions, estimate fairly the fum of felicity.

THUS I have suggested several confiderations, for evincing the unreasonableness of that disquietude which envy raises in our breasts; considerations, which tend at least to mitigate and allay the workings of this malignant passion, and which, in a fober mind, ought totally to extinguish it. The scope of the whole has been, to promote, in every one, contentment with his own irate. Many arguments of a different nature may be employed against envy; some taken from its sinful and criminal nature; some, from the mischiefs to which it gives rife in the world; others, from the misery which it produces to him who nouri/hes this this viper in his bosom. But, undoubted- 



ly, the most efficacious arguments, are such  as .how, that the circumstances of others, compared with our own, afford no ground for envy. The mistaken ideas which are entertained, of the high importance of certain worldly advantages and diffindtions, form the principal cause of our repining at our own lot, and envying that of others.
To things light in themselves, our imagination has added undue weight. Did we 1llow reflection and wisdom to correct the prejudices which we have imbibed, and to disperse those phantoms of our own creating, the gloom which overcasts us would gradually vanish. Together with returning contentment, the Iky would clear up, and every objec brighten around us. It is in ehp fullen and dark fiade of discontent, 
that noxious passions, like venomous animals, breed, and prey upon the heart.

ENVY is a paflion of so odious a nature, 
that not only it is concealed as much as possible from the world, but every man is 4 glad  glad to dissemble the appearances of it to  _- his own heart. Hence, it is apt to grow upon him unperceived. Let him who is desirous to keep his heart chaste and pure from its influence, examine himself ttriCtly on those dispositions which he bears towards his prosperous neighbours. Does he ever view, with secret uneasiness, the merit of others rising into notice and diftintion?
Does he hear their praises with unwilling ear ? Does he feel an inclination to depreciate, what he dares not openly blame ?
When obliged to commend, does his cold and aukward approbation, insinuate his belief of some unknown defects in the applauded character? From such symptoms as these, he may infer that the disease of envy is forming; that the poison is beginning to spread its infection over his heart.

THE causes that nourish envy are principally two; and two which, very frequently, operate in conjunction; these are, pride and indolence. The connecion of pride with with envy, is obvious and direct. The high 


value which the proud set on their own ,_ merit, the unreaibnable claims which they form on the world, and the injustice which they suppose to be done to them by any preserence given to others, are perpetual sources, ; it of discontent, and next of envy. When indolence is joined to pride, the disease of Â¥  mind becomes more inveterate and incurable. Pride leads men to claim more than they deserve. Indolence prevents them from obtaining what they might justly claim. Disappointments follow; and spleen, malignity, and envy, rage within them.
The proud and indolent, are always envious. Wrapt up in their own importance, they fit ffill, and repine, because others are more prosperous than they; while, with all their high opinion of themselves, they have done nothing either to deserve, or to acquire, prosperity. As, therefore, we value our virtue, or our peace, let us guard against these two evil dispositions of mind.
Let us be modest in our own esteem, and, by diligence and indufiry, tfudy to acquire the  the esteem of others. So shall we shut up _. the avenues that lead to many a bad passion; and {hall learn, in whbateverflate we are, bterewitb to be content.

FINALLY, in order to subdue envy,  

us bring often into view those relig1ol, considerations which regard us particularly as Christians. Let us remember how ul; worthy we all are in the fight of God; and how much the bleflings which each of us enjoy, are beyond what we deserve. Let us nourifli reverence and submission to that Divine government, which has appointed to every one such a condition in the world as is fittest for him to poflfs. Let us recolled how opposite the Christian spirit is to envy; and what sacred obligations it lays upon us, to walk in love and charity towards one another. Indeed, when we reflect on the many miseries which abound in human life; on the scanty proportion of happiness which any man is here allowed to enjoy; on the small difference which the diversity of fortune makes on that scanty proportion; 
proportion; it is surprising, that envy should 
ever have been a prevalent passion among 
men, much more that it should have prevailed among Christians. Where so much is suffered in common, little room is left for envy. There is more occasion for pity and sympathy, and inclination to aflift each other. To our own good endeavours for rectifying our dispositions, let us not forget toadd serious prayers to the Author of our being, that he who made the heart of man, and knows all its infirmities, would thoroughly purify our hearts from a pailion so base, and so criminal, as envy. Create in me, 0 God, a clean beart; and renew a right pirit within me. Search me, and know heart. Try me, and ow my thoughts. See if there be any ticked way in me, and lead me in the way everlaflig *.

# SERMON IX. On IDLENESS. MATTHEW, xx. 6. Â— Why stand ye here all the day idle?

[ 72 3 SERMON IX.





- Why IJand ye here all the day idle ?

 IT is an observation which naturally ocIX . curs, and has been often made, that all the representations of the Chriflian life in scripture are taken from active scenes; from carrying on a warfare, running a race, striving to enter in at a strait gate, and, as in this context, labouring in a vineyard. Hence the conclusion plainly follows, that various active duties are required of the Christian; and that sloth and indolence are inconsistent with his hope of heaven.

But But it has been sometimes supposed, that industry, as far as it is matter of duty, iL gards our spiritual concerns and employments only; and that one might be very busy as a Christian, who was very idle as a man. Hence, among some denominations of Christians, an opinion has prevailed, that the perfection of religion was to be found in those monastic retreats, where every active function of civil life was totally excluded, and the whole time of men filled up with exercises of devotion. They who hold such opinions proceed on the supposition, that religion has little or no concern with the ordinary affairs of the world; that its duties stand apart by themselves; and mingle not in the intcrcourfe which men have with one another. The perfet Christian was imagined to live a fort of angelic life, fequestered from the business or pleasures of this contemptible state. The gospel, on the contrary, represents the religion of Christ as intended for the benefit of human society. It assumes men as engaged in the business of a&ive life; and direcs its ex hortations, accordingly, to all ranks ind ,_,_, stations; to the magistrate and the subjet, 
to the mafler and the servant; to the rich and the poor, to them that buy and them that fell, them that uif and them that abut the world. Some duties, indeed, require privacy and retreat. But the moR important must be performed in the midst of the world, where we are commanded to Jbhit at lights, and by our good works to glorif our Father which is in heaven. This world, as the context represents it, is God vineyard, where each of us has a talk assigned him to perform. In every fRation, and at every period of life, labour is required.

# SERMON IX. On IDLENESS. MATTHEW, xx. 6. Â— Why stand ye here all the day idle?

[ 372 3 SERMON IX.





- Why land ye bere all tbe day idle ?

 IT is an observation which naturally ocI. 1 curs, and has been often made, that all the representations of the Christian life in scripture are taken from aaive scenes; from carrying on a warfare, running a race, striving to enter in at a strait gate, and, as in this context, labouring in a vineyard. Hence the conclusion plainly follows, that various acive duties are required of the Christian; and that sloth and indolence are inconfiltent with his hope of heaven.

But But it has been sometimes supposed, that .

industry, as far as it is matter of duty, regards our spiritual concerns and employments only; and that one might be very busy as a Christian, who was very idle as a man. Hence, among some denominations of Christians, an opinion has prevailed, that the perfection of religion was to be found in those mohaftic retreats, where every active function of civil life was totally excluded, and the whole time of men filled up with exercises of devotion. They who hold such opinions proceed on the supposition, that religion has little or no concern with the ordinary affairs of the world; that its duties stand apart by themselves; and mingle not in the intcrcourfe which men have with one another. The perfec 'Christian was imagined to live a fort of angelic life, fequestered from the business or pleasures of this contemptible state. The gospel, on the contrary, represents the religion of Christ as intended for the benefit of human society. It assumes men as engaged in the business of a.tive life; and directs its exBERM. hortations, accordingly, to all ranks _  fiations; to the magistrate and the fubje&, 
to the matter and the servant, to the rich and the poor, to them that buy and them that fell, them that use and them that abuse the world. Some duties, indeed, require privacy and retreat. But the mot important must be performed in the midst of the world, where we are commanded to jbih as lights, and by our good works to glorif our Father which is in heaven. This world, as the context represents it, is God vineyard, where each of us has a talk assigned him to perform. In every tfation, and at every period of life, labour is required. At the third, the sixth, or the eleventh hour, we are commanded to work, if we would not incur, from the great Lord of the vineyard, this reproof, Why .Jand ye here all the day idle --We may, I confess, be 'busy about many things, and yet be found negligent of the One thing needful. We may be very active, and, withal, very ill employed. But though a person may be induftrious without being religious, I must at the the fame time admonish you, that no man .
can be idle without being sinful. This I I"
"Shall endeavour to show in the sequel of the discourse; wherein I purpose to reprove a vice which is too common among all ranks of men. Superiors admonilh their inferiors, and parents tell their children, that idleness is the mother of every fin; while, in their own pracice, they often set the example of what they reprobate severely in others. I shall study to ihow, that the idle man is, in every view, both foolish, and criminal; that he neither lives to God; nor lives to the world; nor lives to him.elf."
"1. HE lives not to God. The great and wife Creator certainly does nothing in vain."
"A finall measure of refledtion might convince every one, that for some useful purpose he was sent into the world. The nature of man bears no mark of infignificancy, or negle& He is placed at the head of all things here below. He is furniihed with a great preparation of faculties and powers."
"ZERM. powers. He is enlightened by reason with _ many important difloveries; even taught by revelation to confider himself as ranfomed, by the death of Christ, from misery; and intended to rife, by gradual advances, to a still higher rank in the universe of God. In such a situation, thus diffinguiihed, thus favoured and assisted by his Creator, can he hope to be forgiven, if he aim at no improvement, if he pursue no useful design, live for no other purpose but to indulge in sloth, to consume the fruits of the earth, and to spend his days in a dream of vanity? Existence is a sacred trult; and he who thus misemploys, and squanders it away, is treacherous to its Author.- Look around you, and you will behold the whole universe full of active powers. Action is, to speak so, the genius of nature. By motion and exertion, the fyftem of being is preserved in vigour. By its different parts always acting in fubordination one to another, the perfection of the whole is carried on. The heavenly bodies perpetually revolve. Day and night incefiintly fantly repeat their appointed course. Â£ "
"tinual operations are going on in the earth, ,_ and in the waters. Nothing stands still."
"All is alive, and stirring, throughout the univerfe.-In the midst of this animated and busy scene, is man alone to remain idle in his place ? Belongs it to him, to be the sole inactive and slothful being in the creation, when he has so much allotted him to do; when in so many various ways he might improve his own nature; might advance the glory of the God who made him; and contribute his part to the genes ral good ?"
"Hardly is there any feeling of the human heart more natural, or more univerfal, than that of our being accountable to God. It is, what the most profligate car never totally erase. Almost all nations have agreed in the belief, that there is to come some period, when the Almighty will at as the judge of his creatures. Prefentiments of this, work in every breat. Conscience has already erected a tribunal, on which it anticipates the sentence which at  III. that Sr  that period shall be palsed. Before this tri_ bunal let us sometimes place ourselves in serious thought, and confider what account we are prepared to give of our conduc to Him who made us.  I placed you, the great Judge may then be supposed to fay,  in a station where you had many occa' sions for acion, and many opportunities  of improvement. You were taught, and  you knew, your duty. Throughout a  course of years I continued your life. I surrounded you with friends, to whom you might be useful. I gave you health, "
" ease, leisure, and various advantages of  situation.- Where are the fruits of  those talents which you possessed ? What ' good have you done with them to your selves? what good, to others? How  have you filled up your place, or answer your deitination, in the world ? Produce some evidence, of your not having existed altogether in vain ?- Let such as are now mere blanks in the world, and a burden to the earth, think what answer they will give to those awful questions."
"II. Tli  THE idle live not to the world, and SET "
"their fellow-creatures around them, any _ more than they do to God. Had any man a title to stand alone, and to be independ.ent of his fellows, he might then confider himself as at liberty to indulge in solitary ease and sloth, without being responsible to others for the manner in which he chore to live. But, on the face of the earth, there is no such person, from the King on his throne, to the beggar in his cottage. We are all conneced with one another, by various relations; which create a chain of mutual dependence, reaching from the highest, to the lowest flation in society. The order and happiness of the world cannot be maintained, without a perpetual circulation of ative duties and ofsices, which all are called upon to perform in their turn. Superiors are no more independent of their inferiors, than these inferiors are of them. Each have demands and claims upon the other; and he, who in any situation of life, refuses to his part, and to contribute his flare to the geN 2 neral . neral flock of felicity, deserves to be proar-__ Icribed from society, as an unworthy member. Ifany man will not work, fays the Apoftle Paul, neither Jhould he eat *. If he will do nothing to advance the purposes of focicty, he has no title to enjoy the advantages of it."
"It is sometimes supposed, that industry and diligence are duties required of the poor alone, and that riches confer the privilege of being idle. This is so far from being justified by reason, how often soever it may obtain in fad, that the higher one is raised in the world, his obligation to be useful is proportionably increased. The claims upon him, from various quarters, multiply. The sphere of his acive duties widens on every hand. Even fuppofmg him exempted from exerting himself in behalf of his inferiors, supposing the relation between fuiperiors and inferiors abolished, the relation among equals must still subsist."
"If there be no man, however high in rank, who stands not frequently in need of the * 2 ef iii. Ic."
"good good offices of his friends, does he think "
"that le owes nothing to them in return ? __ Can he fold his arms in fdlfilh indolence, and expet to be servcd by others, if he will not exert himself, in doing service to any ?- Were there no other call to induftry, but the relation in which every one stands to his own family, the remembrance of this alone, mhould make the man of idleness blush. Pretends he to love those with whom he is connected by the dearest ties, and yet will he not bestir himself for their guidance, their support, or their advancement in the world? How immoral, and cruel, is the part he acs, who slumbers in sensual ease, while the wants and demands of a helpless family cry aloud, but cry in vain, for his vigorous exertions ? Is this a husband, is 'this a father, that deserves to be honoured with those sacred names ?"
"How many voices will be lifted up against him, at the last day ? Let such pcrfons remember the awful words of scripture, and tremble. It is written in the FIirif Epistle to Timothy, the fifth chapter, and eighth 3 verse, "
"8 RM. verse, if any proviae not for his own, and I. specially for thoSe of his own house, ht bath denied the faith, and is worfc than an infidel."
"III. THE idle man lives not to himself, "
"with any more advantage than he lives to the world. It is indeed on a supposition entirely opposite, that persons of this charafter proceed. They imagine that, how deficient soever they may be in point of duty, they at least consult their own satisfadion. They leave to others the drudgery of life; and betake themselves, as they think, to the quarter of enjoyment and ease. Now, in contradition to this, I asfert, and hope to prove, that the idle man, first, shuts the door against all improvement; next, that he opens it wide to every deftruCive folly; and, lastly, that he excludes himself from the true enjoyment of pleasure."
"FIRST, He shuts the door against improvement of every kind, whether of mind, "
"body, or fortune. The law of our nature, "
"the condition under which we were placed ,_ from our birth, is, that nothing good or great is to be acquired, without toil and in."
"duftry. A price is appointed by Providence to be paid for every thing; and the price of improvement, is labour. Induftry may, indeed, be Sometimes disappointed."
"The race may not be always to the fwifi, nor the battle to the flrong. But, at the fame time, it is certain that, in the ordinary course of things, without strength, the battle cannot be gained; without swiftness, the race cannot be run with success."
"In all labour, fays the wife man, there is prfit; but the foul of the Jluggard defireth, and bath nothing *. If we consult either the improvement of the mind, or the health of the body, it is well known that exercise is the great instrument of promoting both."
"Sloth enfeebles equally the bodily, and the mental powers. As in the animal system it engenders disease, so on the faculties of * Prov. xiv. 3.; xiii. 4."
"N 4 the  the foul it brings a fatal rust, which corIx."
"_ rodes and waftes them; which, in a ihort time, reduces the brightest genius to the fame level with the meanest underitanding."
"The great differences which take place among men, are not owing to a diflinftion that nature has made in their original powers, so much as to the superior diligence with which some have improved these powers beyond others. To no purpose do we possess the feeds of many. great abilities, if they are suffered to lie dormant within us. It is not the latent possession, but the active exertion of them, which gives them merit. Thousands whom indolence has funk into contemptible obfcurity, might have come forward to the highell diftinclion, if idleness had not fruftrated the effect of all their powers."
"Instead of going on to improvement, all things go to decline, with the idle man."
"His character falls into contempt. His fortune is consumed. Disorder, confusion, and embarraffmcnt, mark his whole fituation, Obfcrve in what lively colours the gtatc state of his affairs is described by Solomon. sE RMI I went by the field of the Jlothfil, and by the vineyard of the man void of nnderJlanding."
"And lo ! it was all grown over with thorns; and nettles bad covered the face thereof; and the flone wall thereof was broken down."
"Then I saw and confidered it well. I looked upon it, and received irnrtrution *. In the midst, too, of those distresses which idleness brings on its votaries, they must submit to innumerable mortifications, which never fail to attend their mhameful conduct They must reckon, on feeing themselves contemned by the virtuous and wife, and flighted by the thriving part of mankind."
"They mutt expeEt to be left behind by every competitor for rank or fortune. They will be obliged to humble themselves before persons, now far their superiors in the world, whom, once, they would have difdained to acknowledge as their equals.Is it in this manner, that a man lives to himself? Are these the advantages, which * Prov.  30. 31. 32."
"were  were expeced to be found in the lap of uL ease ? The down may at firif have appeared soft: But it will soon be found to cover thorns innumerable. How long wilt thou sleep, 0 Juggard ? When wilt tbou arif out es thyr jeep ? et a little Je+); yet a little Jlmdber, a little folding of the bands to jlep."
"S Jball thy poverty come as one that travelbtb; thy want ai an armed 7man *."
"But this is only a small part of the evils rhich persons of this description bring on themfelvea: For, "
". IN the second place, while in this manner they shut the door against every improvement4 they open it wide to the most deftrutive vices and follies. The human mind cannot remain always unemployed. Its paflions must have some exercife. If we supply them not with proper employment, they are sure to run loose into riot and disorder. While we are unoccupied by what is good, evil is coninu*Prov. xxiv. 33. 34."
"ally ally at hand; and hence it is said in Scrip- RM."
"ture, that as soon as Satan found the bouse IX."
"empty, he took pofreffion, and filled it witb evil. firits *. Every man who recollecs his conduA, may be satisfied, that his hours of idleness have always proved the hours most dangerous to virtue. It was then, that criminal desires arose; guilty pursuits were suggested; and deligns were formed, which, in their iflue, have difquitted and embittercd his whole life. If seasons of idleness be dangerous, what must a continued habit of it prove ? Habitual indolence, by a silent and secret progress, undermines every virtue in the foul. More violent passions run their course, and terminate. They are like rapid torrents, which foam, and swell, and bear down every thing before them. But after having overflowed their banks, their impetuosity subfdes. They return, by degrees, into their natural channel; and the damage which they have done, can be repaired. Sloth is Mtth. xii. 44."
"like SERI. like the flowly-flowing, putrid itream, %_A, which stagnates in the marsh, breeds venomous animals, and poisonous plants; and infects with pestilential vapours the whole country round it. Having once tainted the foul, it leaves no part of it found; and, at the fame time, gives not those alarms to conscience, which the eruptions of bolder and fiercer emotions often occasion. The disease which it brings on, is creeping and iniidious; and is, on that account, more certainly mortal."
"One constant effeca of idleness, is to nourifh the passions, and, of course, to heighten our demands for gratification; while it unhappily withdraws from us the proper means of gratifying these demands. If the desires of the industrious man be set upon opulence or rank, upon the conveniencies, or the splendour of life, he can accomplifi his desires, by methods which are fair and allowable. The idle man has the fame defires with the industrious, but not the fame resources for compafling his ends by honourable means. He must therefore turn himself himself to seek by fraud, or by violence, "
"what he cannot submit to acquire by _ dultry. Hence, the origin of those multiplied crimes to which idleness is daily giving birth in the world; and which contribute so much to violate the order, and to disturb the peace, of society.- In general, the children of idleness may be ranked under two denominations or classes of men; both of whom may, too justly, be termed, The children of the devil. Either, incapable of any effort, they are such as fink into absolute meanness of character, and contentedly wallow with the drunkard and debauchee, among the herd of the fcnfual; until poverty overtake them, or disease cut them off: Or, they are such as, retaining some remains of vigour, are impelled, by their passions, to venture on a desperate attempt for retrieving their ruined fortunes."
"In this cafe, they employ the art of the fraudulent gamester to ensnare the unwary. They issue forth with the highwayman to plunder on the road; or with the thief and the robber, they infest the city BERM. city by night. From this class, our prif_, sons are peopled; and by them the scaffold is furnished with those melancholy admonitions, which are so often delivered from it to the crowd. Such are frequently the tragical, but well known, consequences of the vice against which I now warn you."
"IN the third, and last place, how dangerous soever idleness may be to virtue, are there not pleasures, it may be said, which attend it ? Is there not ground to plead, that it brings a release from the op."
"preflive cares of the world; 4nd sooths the mind with a gentle fatisfa&ion, which is not to be found amidst the toils of a busy and active life --This is. an advantage which, least of all others, we admit it to possess. In behalf of incessant labour, no man contends. Occasional release from toil, and indulgence of ease, is what nature demands, and virtue allows. But what we assert is, that nothing is so great an enemy to the lively and spirited enjoyment of life, as a relaxed and indolent habit of mind."
"He He who knows not what it is to labour,  knows not what it is to enjoy. The feli- _ city of human life, depends on the regular prosecution of some laudable purpose or object, which keeps awake and enlivens all our powers. Our happiness consists in the pursuit, much more than in the attainment, of any temporal good. Reft is agreeable; but it is only from preceding labours, that reft acquires its true relish. When the mind is suffered to remain in continued inaction, all its powers decay. It soon languifhes and sickens; and the pleasures which it proposed to obtain from refit, end in tediousness and insipidity. To this, let that mifcrable set' of men bear witness, who, after spending great part of their life in active indutfry, have retired to what they fancied was to be a pleasing enjoyment of thtmfelves, in wealthy inactivity, and profound repose. Where they expeted to find an elysium, they have found nothing but a dreary and comfortlefs waste. Their days have dragged on, in uniform languor; with the melancholy  choly remembrance often returning, of the chearful hours they passed, when they were engaged in the honelt business, and labours of the world."
"We appeal to every one who has the least knowledge or observation of life, whether the busy, or the idle, have the mos agreeable enjoyment of themselves ? Compare them in their families. Compare them in the societies with which they mingle; and remark, which of them discover most chearfulnefs and gaiety; which possess the most regular flow of spirits; whose temper is most equal; whose good humour, most unclouded. While the active and diligent both enliven, and enjoy, society, the idle are not only a burden to themselves, but a burden to those with whom they are conneaed; a nuisance to all whom they oppress with their company. On whom does time hang so heavy, as on the slothful and lazy ? To whom are the hours so lingering? Who are so often devoured with spleen, and obliged to fly to every expedient which can help them to get rid of themselves ?"
"themselves ? Instead of producing tran- "
"quillity, indolence produces a fretful reft- _ leffnefs of mind; gives rife to cravings which are never satisfied; nourilhes a sickly effeminate delicacy, which fours and corrupts every pleasure."
"ENOUGH has now been said to convince every thinking person, of the folly, the guilt, and the misery, of an idle state. Let these admonitions stir us up, to exert ourfeyves in our different occupations, with that virtuous ativity which becomes men and Christians. Let us arise from the bed of sloth; distribute our time with attention and care; and improve to advantage the opportunities which Providence has bestowed. The material business in which our several stations engage us, may often prove not sufficient to occupy the whole of our time and attention. In the life even of busy men, there are frequent intervals of leisure. Let them take care, that into these, none of the vices of idleness creep."
"Let some secondary, some subsidiary emVOL. III. ployment, "
" ployment, of fair and laudable kind, be _ always at hand to fill up those vacant spaces of life, which too many aflign, either to corrupting amusements, or to mere inaction. We ought never to forget, that entire idleness always borders, either on mifery, or on guilt AT the fame time, let the course of our employments be ordered in such a manner, that in carrying them on, we may be also promoting our eternal interest. With the business of the world, let us properly intermix the exercises of devotion. By religious duties, and virtuous actions, let us fludy to prepare ourselves for a better world."
"In the midst of our labours for this life, it is jnver to be forgotten, that we must first seek the kingdom of God, and bis rigbteoufnefS; and give diligence to make our calling and eleclion sure. Otherwise, how ative soever we may seem to be, our whole activity will prove only a laborious idleness: We shall appear in the end, to have been busy to no purpose, or to a purpose worse than none."
"Then Then only we fulfil the proper character of RM."
"Christians, when we join that pious zeal which becomes us as the servants of God, with that industry which is required of tn, as good members of society; when, according to the exhortation of the Apostle, we are found not Jlothful in buftnefs, and, at the fame time, fervent in spirit, fJrving the '"

"On the SENSE of the DIVINE PRESENCI."
"PSALM Ixxiii. 23."
"_ I am continually with thbe -."
"tSRM. ive in a world which is full of the divine presence and power. We behold every where around us the traces of that supreme goodness, which enlivens and fipports the univerie. Day utteretb fpeccb of it to day; and night Jhowetb knowledge of it to night. Yet, surrounded as we are with the perfections of God, meeting him whereever we go, and called upon by a thousand objecs, to confess his presence, it is both the misfortune and the crime of a great part of of mankind, that they are strangers to Him in whose world they dwell. Occipied with  nothing but their purfuiits of inteteft and pleasure, they pass through this world, as though God were not theie. The virtuous and reflecting, are particularly diftinguifhed from the giddy and dissolute, by that habitual sense of the divine presence which charaderifes the formner. To them, nothing appears void of God. They contemplate his perfetions in the works of nature; and they trace his Providence in the incidents of life. When retired from the world, he often employs their meditation. When engaged in ation, he always influences their conducd Wherever a pious man is, or whatever he does, in ile style of the text, he is continually with Cad."
"The happy effedt of this sentiment on the heart, is fully displayed in the context."
"We fee it allaying all the disquiet which the Psalmist, in the preceding verses, describes himself to have suffered on account of the prosperity of the wicked. The sirs reflection *hich leftored tranquillity to his 0 3 mind, "
"SERK. mind, was the remembrance of the pre. _ fence of God. Neverthelefi, I am continually with thee; thou bast bolden me by my right hand. He became sensible, that whatever distresses the righteous might susser for a time, they could not fail of being compensated in the end, by that Almighty Protector, whose propitious presence ever continued to surround them. Whereupon follow those memorable expressions of his trult and joy in God. Thou faltguide me witb thy counsel; and afterwards receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth I defre chfbdes thee."
"THERE are principally two effects, which the.fenfe of the divine pretence is fitted to produce upon men. One is, to restrain them from vice; the other, to encourage their virtue. Its operation, as a check upon the finner, is obvious. The perpetual presence of so powerful and venerable a witness, is one of the most awful confideratio4 which can be addressed to the dif."
"'solute. It removes all the security which secrecy can be supposed to give to crimes..,_ ~"
"It aggravates the guilt of them, from being committed in face of the Almighty; and has power to strike terror into the heart of the greatest criminal, in the midst'"
"of his misdeeds. While this principle of religion thus checks and terrifies the fin ner, it produces also another effect, that oft flengthening and comforting the good man, in the pratice of his duty. It is the influence of the divine presence on good men, which, in consequence of the Psalmist sentiment, I purpose to confider. To their character, it belongs to be continually with God. I shall endeavour to show the high benefit and comfort which they derive from such a habit of mind; and shall, for this end, first confider their internal moral state; and next, view them as they are asfeted by several of the external accidents and situations of life."
"LET us begin with confidering them in their internal state. The belief of divine 0 4 presence  prefnce ads upon them here, firfl, as an ,, incitement to virtue. The presence of one whom we highly esteem and revere, of a sovereign, for initance, a father, or a friends whose approbation we are solicitous to gain, is always found to exalt the powers of men+"
"to refine, and improve their behaviour."
"Hence, .it has been given as a rule by ancient moralists, that, in order to excel in virtue, we should propound to ourselves some person of eminent and diftinguilhed worth; and should accustom ourselves to ac, as if he were standing by, and beholding us. To the esteem and approbation of their fellow creatures, none are insenfible. There are few who, in the confpicuous parts of their life, when they know the eyes of the public to be fixed on them,  not their part with propriety and decorum. But what is the observation of the public, what is the presence of the greatest or wifcft man on earth, to that pretence of the Divinity which conltantly surrounds us? The man who realises to his mind this august presence, feels a constant incentive tire for acquitting himself with dignity. "
"He views himself as placed on an illuftri- _ ous theatre. To have the Almighty for the fpeator and witness of his condut, is more to him than if the whole world were assembled to observe him. Men judge often falsely, always imperfectly, of what ptfics before them. They are imposed on by specious appearances; and the artful carry away the praise which is due to the deserving. Even fuppofmg them to judge fairly, we may want the opportunity of doing justice to our charaAer, by any proper display of it in the fight of the world."
"Our situation may bury in obscurity, those talents and virtues which were intitled to mminand the highest efteemn. But he, in whose preenrce the good man a  is both an impartial, and an unerring judge of worth. No fallacious appearances impose on him. No secret virtue is hidden from him. He is attentive equally to the meaneft and the greatest; and his approbation confers eternal rewards. The man, therefore, who sets the Lord always before him, "
"is sS  is prompted to excel in virtue by motives, "
"which are peculiar to himself, and which engage, on the of duty, both honour and interest. I have kept tby precepts, and thy teflimonies; for all my ways are before thee *."
"SUPPOSING, however, his virtubus endeavours to be faithful, many imperfections will attend them. A faultless tenor of unblemished life, is beyond the reach of man. Paflions will sometimes overcome him; and ambition or interest, in an unguarded hour, will turn him aside into evil. Hence, he will be aihamed of himself, and disquieted by a sense of guilt and folly. In this fRate, to which we are often reduced by the weakness of human nature, the belief of God continual pretence brings relief to the heart. It aced before as an animating principle. It now ats as a principle of comfort. In the midst of many imperfections, a virtuous man appeals to his divine witness, for the sincerity of his intentions."
"He can appeal to him who knows bis frame, that in the general train of his conduct, it is his study to keep the law of God."
"Mere law, among men, is rigid and inflexible. As no human lawgiver can look into the hearts of his fubjeets, he cannot, even though he were ever present with them, estimate their character exactly. He can make no allowance for particular situations. He mutt prescribe the fame terms to all whom he rules; and treat all alike, according to their outward actions. But every minute diversity of character, temper, and situation, is known to God. It is not only from what his servants do, but from what they seek to do, that he forms his judgement of them. He attends to all those circumstances which render the trial of their virtue, at any time, peculiarly hard. He hears the whisper of devotion as it rifes in the foul He beholds the tear of contrition which falls in secret."
"He fees the good intention struggling in its birth; and pursues it, in its progress, "
"through ft  thrdugh those various obstacles whtich ta  prevent it from ripehing into adion. Good mnn, therefore, Ih theit noll humbled and dejeded state, draw some consolation from his klowledge of their eattrt Though they iay sometimes hive erred from the right path, they can look up to hiih who is ever with them, and fay, as at apostle, wiho hli grievously offnded, oie said to his great Malfet; Lord, tboa itMstvOt all things; bou Inowefl that I ove thee *."
"Appealing thte to therr ofnnifcient withess, they are naturilly soothed and encouraged by the hope of his' clemency. At the fame time, it is the peculiar advantage of this fentimnent of the divine presence, that it prevents such hope from flattering them too much, or rising into undue pteflmtption. For while it encourages, it tends also fdt humble, a Fious man. If it encourage him, by the refedion on all his good dispositions being known and attended to by God, it humbles him, by the remembrance, that bis seret fins also are ever in the light of the divine countenance. So that, by ., dwelling under the sense of God being continually with us, we keep alive the proper temper of a Christian in the foul; humility, without dejection; fear, mingled with hope."
"We are cheared, without being lifted up."
"We feel ourselves obnoxious to the all-obferving eye ofjullice ; but are comforted with the thoughts qs that mercy which, through Jesus Christ, the Discerner of all hearts holds forth to the fncere and penitent."
"Such are the blessed effects which this principle of religion produces upon the inward moral itate of a good man. Let us now, "
"IN the second place, confider his external circumstances; and examine the influence which the fame principle has upon his happiness, in several different situations of life."
"LET us first view him in what the world calls prosperity; when his circumstances are easy or affluent, and his life flows in a smooth  smooth untroubled stream. Here, it might  be thought, that a sense of the divine prefence could operate upon him only, or chiefly, for promoting temperance, and re."
"ftraixiing the disorders incident to a profperous fate. Valuable effects, indeed, these are; and molt conducive to the true enjoyment of all that is agreeable in life. But though it, doubtless, does exert this falutary influence, yet it (tops not there. It not only preserves the virtue of a good man amidit the temptations of pleasure, but it gives to his prosperity a security, and a peculiar relish, which to others is unknown."
"He who is without a sense of God upon his mind, beholds in human affairs nothing but a perpetual fluctuation, and viciflitude of events. He is surrounded with unknown causes, which may be working his deftruction in secret. He cannot avoid perceiving, that there hangs over him the irresistible arm of that Providence, whose displeasure he has done nothing to flay or avert. But he who, in the day of prosperity, dwells with God, is delivered from those disquieting alarms. He dwells as with a friend and protetor, from whom he conceives his _ blessings to proceed. He can appeal to him for the thankfulness with which he receives them; and for his endeavours to employ them well. He trusts, that the God whom he serves will not forsake him; that the goodness which he has already experienced, will continue to bless him; and though he believes himself not exempted from the changes of the world, yet, in the midst of these, he has ground to hope, that sources of comfort and happiness ihall always be left open to him."
"Moreover, the pleasures of life, while they last, are unspeakably heightened by the presence of that Benefactor who bestows them. The pleasing emotion of gratitude to the giver, mingles with the enjoyment of the gift. While to the mere worldly man, the whole frame of nature is only a vast irregular fabric; and the course of human affairs no more than a confused fuc."
"cefllon of fortuitous events; all nature is beautified, and every agreeable incident is enlivened, "
" enlivened, to him who beholds God in all   things. Hence arise a variety of pleasing sensations, to fill up those solitary hours, in which external prosperity supplies him with no entertainment. In the smiling scenes of nature, he contemplates the benignity of its author. In its sublime objecs, he admires his majesty. In its awful and terrible ones, he adores his power. He dwells in this world as in a magnificent temple, which is full of the glory of its founder; and every where views nature offering up its incense to him, from a thousand altars."
"Such ideas exalt and ennoble the human mind; and refle an additional lustre on the brightness of prosperity."
"FROM the prosperous, let us next turn to the afflicted condition of a good man. For, as prosperity may, afflition certainly will, at one time or other, be his lot. It enters into the appointed trial of his virtue; and, in one degree or other, is the doom of all."
"Here we ihall find various situations occur, in which no relief is equal to what a virtuous ruous and holy man derives from a fcnfe of "
"the perpetual presence of God. Is he, for instance, thrown into an obfcure condition in the world, without friends to assist him, or any to regard and confider his itate? He enjoys the fatisfacion of thinking, that though he may be neglected by men, he is not forgotten by God. Inconsiderable as he is in himself, he knows, that he will not be overlooked by the Almighty, amidit the infinite variety of being, or loft in the immensity of his works."
"The poor man can, with as much encouragement as the rich or great, lift up his eyes to heaven, and fay, NAvertbeles, 0 Lord, lam continually with thee: Thou bold."
"efi me by my right hand. The gracious prefence of that Supreme Being is affected by no diversity of rank or fortune. It imparts itself alike to all the virtuous and upright; like its glorious image, the fun in the firmament, which iheds its rays equally upon the humble cottage, and upon the palace of Kings. In the presence of the great Lord of heaven and earth, all the diftindions  III. which GE RM. which vanity has contrived to make among . ' men, totally disappear. All ranks are on one level. The rich and the poor here indeed meet together; without any other diftindtion than what arises from the heart and the fouL The sense of this, lifts the poor man above contempt; supports his spirits when apt to be dejeced; and beitows dignity on the part which he ads. How inconsiderable soever that part may appear in the eftimation of an injudicious world, it is ennobled, when virtuously performed, by the approbation of his divine witness. He can bear with indifference the scorn of the proud, as long as he knows, that there is one higher than the highest to regard hin."
"He can enjoy himself with pleasure in his mean habitation, because he believes that God dwells with him there. The Divine presence chears to him the moit lonely retreat. It accompanies his steps to the most distant regions of the earth. If he should be driven into exile from all his friends, and obliged to dwell in the uttermol? parts of the sea, even there God band would would bold him, and his right band would ER "
"guide him. Though left without compa- _ nion or friend, he never thinks himself desolate, as long as he can fay, Iam Jfill with God."
"BUT though raised above obscurity or poverty, yet, in any situation of fortune, calumny and reproach may be the lot of the servant of God. His good intentions may be mifconftruced; his character unjustly traduced; and, to the open reviling of enemies, the more bitter unkindness of friends may Sometimes be joined. In this fituation, when wounded in spirit, and, perhaps, unable to make his innocence appear, to whom ihall he have recourse for defence, to whom make his last appeal, but to that God who is ever present with him, and who knoweth his heart How frequently, amidst the injustice and oppression of the world, has diftrefled innocence had no other relief but this ?  God is my witness. God is my avenger. He hath seen it; and he will repay. A good con8 ER  science, it is true, is, of itself, a powerful "
",__ support. But God is Lord of the conscience; and it is only when connected with a sense of divine pretence and approbation, that a good conscience becomes a steady principle of fortitude in the mind, under all discouragements. Hence, a virtuous man possesses a high degree of independence, both on the praise, and on the censure of the world. It is enough to him, if, when undergoing the fame reproaches which Job suffered from his mistaken friends, he can fay with him, Behold my witntefs is in heaven, and my record is on bigb *. He affecs not to divulge his good deeds to the world. He is without concern whether the world be acquainted with them, or not. He knoweth, that his Father which is in heaven Jeetb in secret; and that his prayers and his alms come up in grateful memorial before him. With me, it is a small thing to be judged of you, or of man judgement; be that judgetb me is the Lord  JIt * Job ri. 39. I Cor.  I. 4."
"Jhall Jball bring forth my rigbteoufnefs, at last, as SERtM the light, and my judgement as the noon day. In this consciousness of integrity, he looks down with indifference, as from a superior station, upon the harsh censures of a giddy and ignorant world. The sense of being continually with God diffuses over his foul a holy calm, which unjust reproach cannot disturb. In the presence of that august and venerable witness, all the noise and clamours of men, like the murmurings of a distant storm, die away."
"LASTLY, Supposing the character of a good man to be untainted by reproach, supposing also his external situation to be opulent or diftinguiihed, many, notWithstanding, and revere, are the diftreefes to which he may be exposed. Secret griefs may be preying upon him; and his heart left to feed in silence on its own bitterness."
"He may labour under fore disease, and difcern his earthly frame gradually mouldering into dust. He may be deprived of those friends and relatives who had been the 3 chief  chief comforts of his tfate; or may be obX."
"e* _ liged to prepare himself for taking farewel of them for ever. In the midst of these various afflicting scenes of human life, no consolation can be more powerful than what arises from the pretence of a divine protector and guardian, to whom our cafe, with all its sorrows, is perfectly known."
"To him, fays the Pfalnift, I poured out my complaint. IJb/hwed before him my trouble."
"I looked Gn my right band and viewed; but behold there was no man who caredfor my foul. I aid unto thee, 0 Lord, thou art my refuge. When my spirit wal overwhelmed within me, then thou knewejl my path *."
"We all know, that to communicate our gricf to a faithful friend, often gives ease and relief to the burdened heart Such communication we are encouraged to make, and such relief we may expecA to find, in pouring out our heart before that God in whom compaffons flow. We may have no earthly friend to whom we can with full confi."
"Psalm clii. 2. 3. 4."
"dence dence disclose all our sorrows; or we may "
"want words in which to express them. But __ God is the fearchcr of all hearts; and the hearer of all prayers. To the secret anguifh of the foul, he is no inattentive witness. Every groan which is heaved from the labouring bosom, though heard by no hnman car, reaches his throne. As he knows our frame, so he remembhers are duJf; and thence light arise to the upright in darknefi. For the hope naturally springs, that this beneficent being will pity them, as a father pitieth his children; and in the midst of those diftrefles which the present circumftances of man reider unavoidable, willfend them help from his fanfltary. Surrounded with this compassionate pretence of the Almighty, good men never view themselves as left in this vale of tears, to bear, solitary and alone, the whole weight of human woe. In their dark, as well as in their brighter hours, God is with them."
"Even in that valley of the shadow of death, where no friiend, no comforter, can go along to aid them, he is with them still. In 4 the 8ERM. the last extremity of nature, the rod and flaf of the Shepherd of Ifratd support them."
"THUS I have ihown, though in an imperfec manner, what benefits holy men derive from a habitual sense of the divine presence. It animates and strengthens their virtue. It enlivens and brightens their profperity. Under various forms of adversity, it affords them consolation and relief.Such considerations, undoubtedly, form a strong argument in favour of a devout fpirit, and a virtuous life. But they are confiderations which may, probably, be regarded by some, as ideal and visionary; requiring aid from a heated, or an enthusiastic fancy, in order to give them force. I readily admit, that amidst the hurry and turbulence of the world, it may be difficult to bring these religious sentiments as fully into view, as is necessary for their making a just impreflion on the foul. This requires the effort of an intelligent and feeling mind; and therefore cannot be expected to be commonly found. To the unreflecting crowd, nothing appears real, but what pR."
"is exposed to sense. What is invisible, is the fame to them, as if it had no existence."
"But by the grossness of their own conceptions, they have no title to measure those of others. While they asseE to treat all confiderations taken from the sense of the divine pretence, as visionary and enthufiaftic, it can, on the contrary, be clearly ihown, that they are founded on the most certain and unquestionable principles of reason. They essentially belong not to revealed only, but to natural, religion. Their reality can be denied by none, but those who deny that God exists, or that he governs the world. For, if he exist, he must undoubtedly pervade and infpet the world which he governs. He muit know what is going on throughout his own universe; and especially must know what passes within the hearts which he has made, and of which he is to judge. To be every where present, is the attribute of his nature, which, of all others, is the mods necessary to his admiiiftration of the universe. This, "
" accordingly, is an attribute which all _ ligions have ascribed to him. All nations have believed in it. All societies appeal to it, in the folemnities of an oath, by which they determine controversies. This attribute being once admitted to belong to the Deity, the consequences which I have deduced from it, plainly and naturally follow: And every good man has ground to fay, 0 Lord, Iam continually with thee."
"# SERMON XI. ON PATIENCE. LUKE, xxi. 19. In your Patience possess ye your souls."
"E 219 3 SERMON XI."
"In your Patience poefl  your fouls."
"rHE pfffoni of our ulh is a very em- "
"phatical expression. It describes that XI."
"fate in which a man has both the ful command, and the undisturbed enjoyment of himself; in opposition to his undergoing some inward agitation which difcomposes his powers. Upon the leat reflection, it mft appear, how essential such a slate of mind. is to happiness. He only who thns pei bi foul is capable of poffefling any other thing with advantage; and in order to attain and preserve this self felf-pofleffion, the most important requiiwt is, the habitual exercise of patience."
"I know that patience is apt to be ranked by many, among the more humble and obscure virtues; belonging chiefly to those who groan on a sick-bed, or who languish in a prison. If their situation be, happily, of a different kind, they imagine that there is no occasion for the dilcipline of patience being preached to them. But I hope to make it appear, that, in every circumstance of life, no virtue is more important, both to duty and to happiness; or more requisite for forming a manly and worthy cha."
"racer. It is not confined to a situation of continued adversity. It principally, indeed, regards the disagreeable circumstances which are apt to occur. But, in our present state, the occurrence of these is so frequent, that, in every condition of life, patience is incessantly called forth."
"Prosperity cannot be enjoyed, any more than adversity supported, without it. It must enter into the temper, and form the habit of the foul, if we would pafi through the the world with tranquillity and honour. "
"What I purpose is, to point out some of the chief occasions on which patience is required; and to recommend and enforce the exercise of it, in order to our pojing eur fouls."
"I. PATIENCE under provocations. The wide circle of human society is diversified by an endless variety of characters, difpofitions, and paflions. Uniformity is, in no refpea, the genius of the world. Every man is marked by some peculiarity which distinguishes him from another: and no where can two individuals be found who are exactly, and in all refpets, alike."
"Where so much diversity obtains, it cannot but happen, that, in the intercourse which men are obliged to maintain, their tempers {hall often be ill adjusted to that intercourse; {hall jar, and interfere with each other. Hence, in every fation, the highest as well as the lowest, and in every condition of life, public, private, and domeftic, occafions-of irritation frequently arise."
"We  We are provoked, sometimes, by the folly ,Xl. and levity of those with whom we are conneted; sometimes, by their indifference or neglec; by the incivility of a friend, the haughtiness of a superior, or the insolent behaviour of one in lower station. Hardly a day passes, without somewhat or other occurring,whichferves to ruffle the man of impatient spirit. Of course, such a man lives in a continual form. He knows not what it is to enjoy a train of good humour."
"Servants, neighbours, friends, spouse, and children, all, through the unrestrained violence of his temper, become sources of difturbance and vexation to him. In vain is affluence; in vain are health and profperity. The lealt trifle is sufficient to difcompose his mind, ana poitbn his pleafures. His very amusements are mixed with turbulence and passion."
"I would beseech this man to confider, of what small moment the provocations which he receives, or at least imagines himself to receive, are really in themselves; but of what great moment he makes them, by fullering faffering them to deprive him of the pof- "
"'session of himself. I would befcech him, I to confider, how many hours of happineis he throws away, which a little more patience would allow him to enjoy; and how much he puts it in the powcr of the moit insignificant persons to render lim miserable.  But who can expect, we hear him exclaim,  that he is to possess the infenfibility of a itone ? How is it possible for human nature to endure so many re peated provocations? or to bear calmly with such unreasonable behaviour?My brother ! if you can bear with no in."
"'stances of unreasonable behaviour, withdraw yourself from the world. You are no longer fit to live in it. Leave the intercourfe of men. Retreat to the mountain, and the desert; or fliut yourself up in a cell. For here, in the midst of society, of'nces mtl conic. You might as well expec, when you beheld a calm atmoi)here, and a clear Iky, that no clouds were ever to rife, and no winds to blow, as that your life was long to proceed, without receiving sr  ceiving provocations from human frailty."
"__, The careless and the imprudent, the giddy and the fickle, the ungrateful and the interested, every where meet us. They are the briars and the thorns, with which the paths of human life are beset. He only who can hold his course among them with patience and equanimity, he who is prepared to bear what he must expet to happen, is worthy of the name of a man."
"Did you only preserve yourself compofed for a moment, you would perceive the insignificancy of molt of those provocations which you magnify so highly. When a few funs more have rolled over your head, the storm will have, of itself, subsided; the cause of your present impatience and diturbance will be utterly forgotten. Can you not, then, anticipate this hour of calmness to yourself; and begin to enjoy the peace which it will certainly bring ? If others have behaved improperly, leave them to their own folly, without becoming the victim of their caprice, and punishing yourself on their account. Patience, in this exercise of it, "
"cannot cannot be too much studied by all who wish their life to flow in a smooth stream. "
"It is the reason of a man, in opposition to the passion of a child. It is the enjoyment of peace, in opposition to uproar and confusion. He that bath no rule over his own spirit, i like a city that is broken down, and withost walk *.-The next important exercife of patience is, "
"II. PATIENCE under disappointments."
"These will often happen to the best and wisest men; sometimes, to the wisest and best concerted plans. They may happen, too, not through any imprudence of thoe who have devised the plan, not even through the malice or ill design of others but merely in cenfequence of some of those croft incidents of life which could not be foreseen. On such occations, persons of a warm and sanguine temper are presently in a ferment. They had formed their hopes, as they think, upon the jufteft grounds."
"* Prr', lxv. 0t."
"Voi.. III. Q They aERM. They had waited long for success; and xl. xsL( borne with many delays. But when their designs are brought to so unexpected an issue; when, without any fault of their own, they find their hopes finally blasted, all patience forsakes them; they no longer possess their fouls; the molt passionate exclamations break forth.  To whom, ex cept to them, could such a disappoint ment have happened? Since the creation of the world, was such a combination of  disastrous incidents ever beheld? Why i are they doomed to be so unfortunate  beyond all others ?- Alas ! how unflilfully have you calculated the course of human events ? How raihly and prefumptuoufly had you trusted to success? To whom was it ever given, to guard against all the vicissitudes, which the fluctuating fajbion of the world is incessantly bringing about ? If one friend, to whom you looked up has died, or another has loft his influence and power; if the opinion of the public is changed, and its favour has been withdrawn; if some mistakes have occurred red to lessen the good will of a patron on ER "
"whom you depended; if, through the concurrence of these, or such like circumstances, a more fortunate rival has prevailed against you ; what is there in all this, that differs from the ordinary lot of man ?"
"Are we not, each in his turn, doomed to experience the uncertainty of worldly pursuits ? Why, then, aggravate our misfortunes by the unreasonable violence of an impatient spirit ? If our designs have failed through rashness or mifcondud, let us blame ourselves. If they have failed through circumstances which we could not prevent, let us submit to the fate of man; and wait, with patience, till a more favourable opportunity Ihall occur of regaining success."
"Meanwhile, let us turn to the other oT the profpecd; and calmly confider how dubious it was, whether the success which we longed for, would have proved a blefsing. Who knoweth what is good for man in this life ? Perhaps, the accomplishment of our designs might have been pregnant Q 2 with 8ERM. with misery. Perhaps, from our present tJ-_ isappointment, future prosperity may rife."
"Of such unlooked for iffucs, we all know there have been many examples. Who can tell, whether our cafe may not add one to the number ?-At any rate, let us recollet, that there is a Supreme Ruler, who disposes of the affairs of men; under whom, all fecond causes work only as subordinate agents. Looking up to that irresistible arm which is stretched over our heads, let us be calm; let us submit and adore. Either to despair, or to rage, under disappointments, is sinful. By the former, we injure outfelves. By the latter, we insult Providence, and provoke its displeasure to continue. To posess our foufi in patience is, at once, our wisdom as men, and our duty as Chriflians. The benefits of this virtue are so often reaped in this world, that good policy alone would recommend it to every thinking man. Disappointments derange, and overcome, vulgar minds. The patient and the wife, by a proper improvement, frequently make them contribute to their their high advantage.-Let me next recommend, "
"III. PATIENCE under relfraints. Numerous are the restraints imposed on us, by the nature of the human condition. To the restraints of authority and law, all must submit. The reitraints of education and discipline lie on the young. Conliderations of health reitrain the indulgence of pleasure. Attentions to fortune reitrain expence. Regard to friends, whom we are bound to please; refped to eftablifled cultoms, and to the opinions of society, impose restraints on our general behaviour."
"There is no man, in any rank of life, who is always at liberty to aft according as he would incline. In some quarter or other, he is limited by circumstances, that either actually confine, or that ought at least to confine and restrain him."
"These restraints, the impatient are apt to fcor. They will needs burst the barriers which reason had ereced, or their fituajion had formed; and without regard to Q 3 consequences, "
". conlleqlences, give free scope to their preX'i_. ent wish. Hence, many dangerous excedfes flow; much confusion and misery are produced in human life. Had men the patience to submit to their condition, and to wait till it thould allow them a freer indulgence of their desires, they might, in a short time, obtain the power of gratifying them with lafety. If the young, for instance, would undergo, with patience, the labours of education, they would rife, at a proper period, to honours, riches, or ease. If the infirm would, with patience, bear the regulations which their constitution demands, they might regain the comforts of health. If persons of firaitened fortune had patience to conform themselves to their circumstances, and to abridge their pleasures, they might, by degrees, improve and advance their tlate. Whereas, by eagerness of temper, and precipitancy of indulgence, they forfeit all the advantages which patience would have procured ; and incur the opposite evils to their full extent, "
"IN IN the present state of human affairs, "
"no leflbn is more necessary to be learned __."
"by all, to be inculcated on the young, and to be practised by the old, than that of patient fubmiflion to necessity. For under the law of necessity, we are all inevitably placed. No man is, or can be, always his own matter. We are obliged, in a thousand cafes, to submit and obey. The difcipline of patience preserves our minds eafy, by conforming them to our state. By the impetuosity of an impatient and unsubmitting temper, we fight against an unconquerable power; and aggravate the evil we muit endure.-Another important exerci of the virtue concerning which we discourse, is, "
"IV. PATIENCE under injuries and wrongs. To these, amidst the present confusion of the world, all are exposed. No itation is so high, no power so great, no charater so unblemiihed, as to exempt men from being attacked by ralhnefs, malice, or envy. To behave under such atQ 4 tacks ERM. tacks with due patience and moderation, _, is, it mutt be confcllcd, one of the molt trying exercises of virtue.-But, in order to prevent nlitakes on this fubjecc, it is necessary to observe, that a tame uibmifsion to wrongs is not required by religion.
We are, by no rmeang, to imagine, that religion tends. to extinguilh the sense of honour, or to fiuppirc the exertion of a manly pirit. It is under a falle apprehension of this kind, that Christian patience is sometimes ftigmatilfd in discourse, as no other than a different name for cowardice.
On the contrary, every man of virtue 6ught to feel what is due to his characer, and to support properly his own rights.
Resentment of wrong, is an useful principle in human nature; and for the wileft purposes, was implanted in our frame. It is the necessary guard of private rights; and the great restraint on the insolence of the violent, who, if no resistance were made, would trample on the gentle and peaceable.

Resentment, however, if not kept within in due bounds, is in hazard of rising into SERIB.
fierce and cruel revenge. It is the office of XL patience, to temper relfntment by reason.
In this view, it is moll properly described in the text, by a man pofierJig his Joul; acting the part which felf-defence, which juffice, or honour, require him to act, without being transported out of himself by the vehemence of anger; or insisting on such degrees of reparation as bear no proportion to the wrong that he has suffered. What proportion, for instance, is there between the life of a man, and an affront received by some rash expression in conversation, which the wife would have flighted; and which, in the course of a few weeks, would have been forgotten by every one ? How fantastic, then, how unjustifiable, are those supposed laws of modern honour, which for such an affront, require no less reparation than the death of a fellow-creature; and which, to obtain this reparation, require a man to endanger his own life?
Laws, which as they have no foundation in reason, never received the least fanAion from BERM. from any of the wife and polished nations XjI_ of antiquity; but were deviled in the darkcft ages of the world, and are derived to us from the ferocious barbarity of Gothic manners.

Nothing is so inconsistent with felf-pofsession as violent anger. It overpowers reason; confounds our ideas; distorts the appearance, and blackens the colour, of every object. By the storm which it raifcs within, and by the mischiefs which it occafions without, it generally brings on the pallionate and revengeful man, greater mifery than he can bring on his enemy. Patience allays this deftrufive tempest, by making room for the return of calm and fober thought. It suspends the blow which sudden resentment was ready to inflict. It disposes us to attend to the alleviating circumftances, which may be discovered in the midst of the wrongs we suppose ourselves to have suffered. Hence, it naturally inclines us to the moderate and gentle  and while it allows all proper meafures to be taken, both for safety, and for just just redress, it makes way for returning 

peace. Without some degree of patience exercised under injuries, human life would be rendered a state of perpetual hofility; offences and retaliations would succeed to one another in endless train; and the world would become a field of blood.-It now remains to recommend,   PATIENCE under adversity and asflition. This is the moil common sense in which this virtue is understood; as it refpeds difeaie, poverty, old age, loss of friends, and the other calamities which are incident to human life. Tbozgh a man live many years, and rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the days of darkncfs, for they shall be many *. The various duties to which patience, under this view, gives rife, afford a larger subjeC to discourse than I am at present to pursue. In general, there are two chief exercises of patience under adversity; one refpe God, and another rcfpeCing men.

Patience, with refped to God, must, in in the days of trouble, suppress the risings of a murmuring and rebellious spirit. It must appear in that calm resignation to the will of Heaven, which is expressed in those pious sentiments of ancient good men: I was dumb; I opened not my mouth, beerafe Ibou did it. It is the Lord, let him do what Jfemetb good in his eyes. Shall we receive good at the band of the Lord, and Jhall we not receive evil aljo ? This is loyalty to the great Governor of the universe. This is that reverence which so well becomes creatures who know they are dependent, and who must confess themlrlves to be linful.
Such a spirit is fitted to attract the favour of Heaven; and to bring the revere vifitation sooner to a close. Whereas the stubborn and impatient, who submit not themselves to the decrees of the Most High, require to be humbled and subdued by a continuance of chastisement.

Patience in adversity, with refped to men, mulf appear by the composure and tranquillity of our behavieor. The -loud complaint, 
complaint, the querulous temper, and fret- SER ful spirit, disgrace every character. They i._ [how a mind that is unmanned by misfortunes. We weaken thereby the sympathy of others; and estrange them from the ofsices of kindness and comfort. The exertions of pity will be feeble, when it is mingled with contempt. At the fame time, by thus weakly yielding to adversity, we allow its weight to bear us down with double pressure. Patience, by preserving composure within, refifis the impression which trouble makes from without. By leaving the mind open to every consolation, it naturally tends to alleviate our burden.
-To maintain a steady and unbroken mind, amidst all the hlocks of the world, forms the highest honour of a man. Pa.
tience, on such occations, rifes to magna.
nimity. It ihows a great and noble mind, which is able to reft on itself, on God, and a good conscience; which can enjoy itself amidst all evils; and would rather endure the greatest hardihips, than submit to what was diihonourable, in order to obtain re lief. This gives proof of a strength that is derived from Heaven. It is a beam of the Immortal Light, shining on the heart.
Such patience, is the most complete triumph of religion and virtue; and accordingly it has ever charaderifed those whole names have been tranfinitted with honour to pofterity. It has ennobled the hero, the faint, and the martyr. We arc troubled on tevry  yet not diflrejed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not fjrfaken; cafi down, but not deIlroyed *.

THUS I have traced Patience through several of its moft,important operations, in different circumstances of life; under provocations; under disappointments; under restraints; under injuries; and under asflictions. We now fee, that it is a virtue of universal use. No man, in any condition, can pass his days with tolerable comfort, who has not learned to practise it.
His prosperity will be continually disturb* Cor.  8. 9.

  and his adversity will be clouded with double darkness. He will be uneasy and _ troublesome to all with whom he is conneted ; and will be more troublesome to himself than to any other.- Let me particularly advise those who wiflh to cultivate so necessary a virtue, to begin their cultivation of it, on occasions when small offences and provocations arise. It is a great, but common, error to imagine, that we are at liberty to give loose reins to temper, among the trivial occurrences of life.
No excuse for irritation and impatience can be worse, than what is taken from the person being inconsiderable, or the incident being flight, which threw us off our guard.
With inconsiderable persons we are furrounded. Of flight incidents, the bulk of human life is composed. In the midst of there, the ruling temper of the mind is formed. It is only by moderation and selfcommand then acquired, that we can inure ourselves to patience, when the great conjunCtures of life shall put it to a feverer trial. If neglected then, we {hall afterwards SERM wards solicit its return in vain.

wI order to assist us in the acquisition of this grace, let us often contemplate that great model of it, which is displayed in the whole life of our Saviour Jesus Christ.

# SERMON XII. On MODERATION. PHILLIPPIANS,  5. Let your Moderation be known unto all Men. Â—






PHILLIPPIANS,  
Let your Moderation be knuon unto all Men.
sERM. THE present slate of man is neither doomed to conltant misery, nor designed for complete happiness. It is, in general, a mixed state, of comfort and Torrow, of profpcrity and adversity; neither brightened by uninterrupted sunshine, nor overcatl with perpetual ihade; but subjet to alternate fucceilions of the one, and the other. While such a fate forbids despair, it also checks presumption. It is equally adverse to depondency of mind, and to high high elevation of spirits. The temper which best suits it, is expreffe4 ni the text by mao-  deration; which, as the habitual tenor of the foul, the apostle exhorts us to discover in our whole conduc; let it be known unto all men. This virtue consists in the equal balance of the fouL It imports such proper government of our pafions and pleafures, as {hall prevent us from running into extremes of any kind; and shall produce a calm and temperate frame of mind.
It chiefly refpets our conduct in that tate, which comes under the description of ease, or prosperity. Patience, of which I treated in the preceding discourse, direts the proper regulation of the mind, under the disagreeable incidents of life. Moderation determines the bounds within which it should remain, when circumitances are a.
greeable or promising. What I now purpose is, to point out some of the chief instances in which Moderation ought to take place, and to how the importance of preserving it.


 I. MODERATION in our wimtes. The XI. active mind of man seldom or never refts satisfied with its present condition, how prosperous soever. Originally formed for a wider range of objects, for a higher sphere of enjoyments, it finds itself, in every situation of fortune, straitened and confined. Sensible of deficiency in its state, it is ever fending forth the fond desire, the aspiring wish, after something beyond what is enjoyed at present. Hence, that restlessnefa which prevails so generally among mankind. Hence, that disgust of pleasures which they have tried; that palfion for novelty; that ambition of rising to some degree of eminence or felicity, of which they have formed to themselves an indiftin& idea. All which may be confidered as indications of a certain native, original greatness in the human foul, swelling beyond the limits of its present condition; and pointing at the higher objects for which it was made. Happy, if these latent remains of our primitive state served to dired our wishes towards their proper deftination, and to lead us into the path of true .


But in this dark and bewildered state, 
the aspiring tendency of our nature unfortunately takes an opposite direction, and feeds a very misplaced ambition. The flattering appearances which here present themselves to sense; the diftintions which fortune confers; the advantages and pleafures which we imagine the world to be capable of bestowing, fill up the ultimate with of molt men. These are the objets which ingrofs their solitary mulings, and ltimulate their active labours; which warm the brealts of the young, animate the induftry of the middle aged, and often keep alive the pallions of the old, until the very close of life. Assuredly, there is nothing unlawful in our wilhing to be freed from whatever is disagreeable, and to obtain a fuller enjoyment of the comforts of life.
But when there vwithes are not tempered by reason, they arc in danger of precipitating us into much extravagance and folly. Defires and willies are the first iirings of ac  When they become exorbitant, the Xll.
_ whole characer is likely to be tainted. If we susser our fancy to create to itself, worlds of ideal happiness; if we feed our imagination, with plans of opulence and splendor far beyond our rank; if we fix to our wishes certain stages of high advancement, or certain degrees of uncommon reputation or diftintion, as the sole stations of felicity; the assured consequence will be, that we shall become unhappy in our present state; unfit for a the part, and difcharging the duties that belong to it; we shall discompose the peace and order of our minds, and foment many hurtful paflions.
Here, then, let Moderation begin its reign; by bringing within reasonable bounds the withes that we form. As soon as they become extravagant, let us check them, by proper refleftions on the fallacious nature of those objecs, which the world hangs out to allure dcfire.

You have strayed, my friends, from the road which conducs to felicity; you have diffhontured the native dignity of your fouls, 
founls, in allowing your wishes to terminate . 
on nothing higher than worldly ideas of XIL grcatnefs or happiness. Your imagination roves in a land of lhadows. Unreal forms deceive you. It is no more than a phantom, an illusion of happiness, which attrats your fond admiration; nay, an illusion of happiness, which often conceals much real misery. Do you imagine, that all are happy, who have attained to thole summits of distinction, towards which your wishes aspire ? Alas ! how frequently has experience shewed, that where rotes were supposed to bloom, nothing but briars and thorns grew ? Reputation, beauty, riches, grandeur, nay, royalty itself, would, many a time, have been gladly exchanged by the polfeffors, for that more quiet and humble station, with which you are now diffatif.
sied. With all that is splendid and ihining in the world, it is decreed that there should mix many deep fiades of woe. On the elevated situations of fortune, the great calamities of life chiefly fall. There the Itorm spends its violence, and there the thunder 4 hreaks 6E  breaks; while safe and unhurt, the inhabitXII.

ant of the vale remains below.- Retreat, then, from those vain and pernicious excursions of extravagant desire. Satisfy yourselves with what is rational and attainable.
Train your minds to moderate views of human life, and human happiness. Remember, and admire, the wisdom of Agur with. Remove far from me vanity and lies.
Give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed me with food convenient for me: Left I be full, and deny thee, and fay, who is the Lord or leIf I be poor, and Jfeal, and take the name of my God in vain *.- Let me recommend,   MODERATION in our pursuits.

Wishes and desires reft within. If immoderate and improper, though they taint the heart, yet society may not be affeced by them. The obscure and harmless individual may indulge his dreams, without (lilhllbl the public peace. But when the active pursuits in which we engage, 
' Prov. xxi. 8. 9.

rife rife beyond moderation, they fill the world with great disorders; often with flagrant i.
crimes. This admonition chiefly relpects the ambitious men of the world. I fay not, that all ambition is to be condemned; or that high pursuits ought, on every occasion, to be checked. Some men are formed by nature, for rising into conspicuous stations of life. In following the impulse of their minds, and properly exerting the talents with which God has blessed them, there is room for ambition to in a laudable sphere, and to become the inltrument of much public good. But this may fafcly be pronounced, that the bulk of men are ready to over-rate their own abilities, and to imagine themselves equal to higher things than they were ever designed for by nature. Be fober, therefore, in fixing your aims, and planning your deftined pursuits. Beware of being led afide from the plain path of found and moderate conduct, by those false lights which felf-flattery is alwa ready to hang out.
1By aiming at a mark too high, you may fall  fall ihort of what it was within your  power to have reached. Instead of attaining to eminence, you may expose yourfelvcs to derision; nay, may bring upon your heads manifold disasters. Ifay to every man that it among you, not to tbink of himfeif more highly than be ought to think, but to think Joberly *.

Whatever your aims be, there is one exercife of moderation which must be enjoined to those of the greatest abilities, as well as to others; that is, never to tranfgrefs the bounds of moral duty. Amidst the warmth of pursuit, accustom yourselves to fuhmit to the retraints, which religion and virtue, which propriety and decency, which regard to reputation and charader, impose. Think not, that there are no barriers which ought to stop your progrefs. It is from a violent and impetuous spirit that all the evils spring, which are so often found to accompany ambition.
Hence, in private life, the laws of truth ' Rom. xii. 3.

and and honour are violated. Hence, in pu- 
blic contests, the peace and welfare of na- .^
tions have been so often sacrificed to the ambitious projects of the great. The man of moderation, as he is temperate in his wilhes, so in his pursuits he is regulated by virtue. A good conscience is to him more valuable than any success. He is not so much bent on the accomplithment of any design, as to take a dishonourable flep, in order to compass it. He can have patience. He can brook disappointments.
He can yield to unsurmountable obstacles; and, by gentle and gradual progress, is more likely to succeed in the end, than others are, by violence and impetuosity. In his highest enterprise, he wiflies not to have the appearance of a meteor, which fires the atmosphere; or, of a comet, which altonithes the public, by its blazing, eccentric course; but rather to resemble those steady luminaries of heaven, which advance in their orbits, with a silent and regular motion. He approves himself thereby to the virtuous, the wife, and discerning i BERM.  and, by a temperate and unexcep tionable condut, escapes those dangers which persons of an opposite deicription are perpetually ready to incur.

III. BE moderate in your expecations.

When your slate is flourilhing, and the courfc of events proceeds according to your wish, susser not your minds to be vainly lifted up. Flatter not yourselves with high profpeds of the increasing favours of the world, and the continuing applause of men.
Say not within your hearts, My mountain flands fprong, and Jhall never be moved. I Jhall never fee adversity. To-morrow Jhall be as this day, and more abundantly.-You are betraying yourselves; you are laying a sure foundation of disappointment and mifery, when you allow your fancy to soar to such lofty pinnacles of confident hope.
By building your house in this airy region, you are preparing for yourselves a great and cruel fall. Your truf/ is the Jbider twb. You may lean on your bouse; but it thall notjiand. You may bold it fai ; but it Jhall Jball not endure. For, to man on earth it 


was never granted, to gratify all his hopes; _ or to perfcvcre in one trad of uninterrupted profpcrity. Unpleafing viciflitudes never fail to succeed those that were grateful.
The fajhion of the world, how gay or fiiling soever, paf'ib, and often pafleth fuddenly, away.

By want of moderation in our hopes, 
we not only increase dejecaion, when difappointment comes, but we accelerate difappointment; we bring forward, with greater speed, disagreeable changes in our state.
For the natural consequence of prefumptuous expectation, is raihnefs in condut.
He who indulges confident security, of course neglects due precautions against the dangers that threaten him; and his fall will be foreseen, and predited. He not only exposes himself unguarded to dangers, but he multiplies them against himself. By presumption and vanity, he either provokes enmity, or incurs contempt.

The arrogant mind, and the proud hope, are equally contrary to religion, and to ERM. to prudence. The world cannot bear such XIL a spirit; and Providence seldom fails to check it. The Almighty beholds with difpleasure those who, intoxicated with profperity, forget their dependence on that Supreme Power which raised them up. His awful government of the world has been in nothing more conspicuous than in bringing low the lofty looks of man, and seatering the proud in the imaginations of their minds.
-Is not this the great Babylon which I have built by the might of my power, and for the honour of my Majesty * ? Thus exclaimed the presumptuous monarch, in the pride of his heart. But, lo! when the word was yet in his mouth, the visitation from heaven came, and the voice was heard; 0, Nebuchadnezzar! to thee it is spoken; thy kingdom is departed from thee.-He that exaltetb bimfelf, Jhall be humbled; and be that humblethb imfef, Jball be exalted  A temperate spirit, and moderate expectations, are the best safeguard of the mind in this Danid,  3. 31.

uncertain uncertain and changing state. They en- SF.RM.
able us to pals through life with most XII.
comfort. When we rife in the world, they contribute to our elevation; and if we must fall, they render our fall the lighter.
  MODERATION in our pleasures is an important exercise of the virtue which we are now confidering. It is an invariable law of our present condition, that every pleasure which is pursued to excels, converts itself into poison. What was intended for the cordial and refreshment of human life, through want of moderation, we turn to its bane. In all the pleasures of sense, it is apparent, that only when indulged within certain limits, they confer fatisfation. No sooner do we pass the line which temperance has drawn, than pernicious effects come forward, and flow themselves. Could I lay open to your view the monuments of death, they would read a leture in favour of moderation, much more powerful than any that the most eloquent preacher can gie. You would behold BERM. hold the graves peopled with the victims   of intemperance. You would behold those chambers of darkness hung round, on every  with the trophies of luxury, drunkennefs, and sensuality. So numerous would you find those martyrs of iniquity, that it may safely be asserted, where war or peftilence have lain their thousands, intemperate pleasure has slain its ten thousands.

While the want of moderation in pleasure brings men to an untimely grave, at the fame time, until they arrive there, it pursues and afflicA them with evils innumerable. To what cause so much as to this, are owing, faded youth, and premature old age; an enervated body, and an enfeebled mind; together with all that long train of diseases, which the indulgence of appetite and sense have introduced into the world? Health, chearfulness, and vigour, are known to be the offspring of temperance. The man of moderation brings to all the natural and innocent pleasures of life, that found uncorrupted relili, which gives him a much fuller fullzr enjoyment of them, than the pallcd qs .RM.


and vitiated appetite of the voluptuary al- _, lows him to know. He culls the flower of every allowable gratification, without dwell upon it until the flavour be loft He taftes the ifvezt of every pleaflre, without pursuing it till the bitter dregs rife. Whereas the man of opposite charaacr dips so deep, that he never fails to stir an impure and noxious sediment, which lies at the bottom of the cup. -In the plcafures, besides, which are regulated by moderation, there is always that dignity which goes along with innocence. No man needs to be alhamed of them. They are confitent with honour; with the favour of God, and of man. But the sensualist, who difdains all restraint in his pleasures, is odious in the public eye. His vices become gross; his charader, contemptible; and he ends in being a burden both to himself and to society. Let me exhort you, once more,   To moderation in all your passions.
This exercise of the virtue is the more re4  III. guifite, 
 quifite, because there is no passion in hu-Lvj man nature but what has, of itself, a tendency to run into excess. For all passion implies a violent emotion of mind.. Of course, it is apt to derange the regular course of our ideas; and to produce confusion within. Nothing, at the fame time, is more seducing than paflion. During the time when it grows and swells, it constantly justifies, to our apprehenlion, the tumult which it creates, by means of a thousand false arguments which it forms, and brings to its aid. Of some passions, such as anger and resentment, the excess is so obviously dangerous, as loudly to call for moderation. He who gives himself up to thl impetuofty of such passions, without retraint, is universally condemned by the world; and hardly accounted a man of found mnind. But, what is less apt to be attended to, some even of those passions which arc reckoned innocent, or whose tendency to disorder and evil is not apparent, fland, nevertheless, in need of moderation and refwaint, as well as others. For, such is the ,  .*~~ ~feeblenelf feebleness of our nature, that every padfion which has for its object any worldly good, XIL is in hazard of attaching us too strongly, and of transporting us beyond the bounds of reason. If allowed to acquire the full and unrestrained dominion of the heart, it is futdicient, in various situations, to render us miserable; and almost in every fituation, by its ingrofling power, to render us negligent of dutes which, as men or Chriltians, we are bound to perform.

Of the insidious growth of passion, theiefore, we have great reason to beware. We ought always to have at hand confiderations, which may ailift us in tempering its warmth, and in regaining poffeflion of our fouls. Let us be persuaded, that moments of paflion are always moments of delusion; that nothing truly is, what it then seems to be.; that all the opinions which we then form, are erroneous; and all the judgements which we pass, are extravagant. Let moderation accustom us to wait until the fumes of pafflion be spent; until the milt which it has raised begin to be diipatcd.
 2 We  We lhall then be able to fee where truth XI aand right lie; and reason shall, by degrees, 
resume the ascendant. On no occasion let us imagine, that strength of mind is shown by violence of paflion. This is not the strength of men, but the impetuosity of children. It is the strength of one who is in the delirium of a fever, or under the disease of madness. The strength of such a person is indeed increased. But it is an unnatural strength; which being under no proper guidance, is direced towards objeas that occasion his deftruifon. True strength of mind is 1hown in governing and refiffing passion, not in giving it scope; in restraining the wild beast within; and a  on the most trying occasions, according to the dictates of conscience, and temperate reason.

THUS I have pointed out, in several instances, how moderation ought to be difplayed: Moderation in our withes; moderation in our pursuits; moderation in our hopes; moderation in our pleasures; 
moderation moderation in our passions. It is a prin- 

XYrI ciple which should habitually influence our Lx.
conduct, and form the reigning temperature of the obul.

TlHE great motive to this virtue is suggested by the words immediately following the text; the Lord is at band. The Judge is coming, who is to close this temporary scene of things, and to introduce a higher slate of exitence. The day is at hand, which will place the great concerns of men in a point of view very different from that in which they are at present beheld; will itrip the world of its false glory; will detect the vanity of earthltr pursuits; and disclose objecs which have the proper title to interest a rational mind. Objeds acquire power to engage our paflions, only in proportion as they arc conceived to be great. But great, or little, are no more than terms of conlparifon. Those things which appear great to one who knows nothing greater, will fink into a diminutive size, when he becomes acquainted with objects of a highS 3 er Rk  er nature. Were it oftener in our thoughts, 11I that the Lord is at hand, none ot thoie things which now difcorlmofe and agitacc worldly men, would appear of sufficient magnitude to raise commotion in our breasts. Enlarged views of the future deftination of man, and of the place which he may hope to possess in an eternal world, naturally give birth to moderation of mind. They tend to cool all mifplaced ardour about the advantages of this Rate; and to produce that calm and temperate frame of spirit, which becomes men and Christians. They give no ground for entire disregard of earthly concerns. While we are men, we must feel and aat as such.
But they afford a good reason why they who believe the Lord to be at band, Should let their moderation appear, and be known unto all men.

On the JoY, and the BITTERNESS of the HEART.

PROVERBS, xiv. 1o.

rbe heart knowctb his own bitrcn:cfs, and a Jlranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.
 is well known, that men have always been much inclined to place their hap- _piness in the advantages of fortune, and the diftintions of rank. Hence these have been pursued by the multitude with such avidity, that every principle of honour, probity, and virtue, have been sacrificed to the attainment of them. At the fame time, many circumitances might have convinced men, that supposing them to be fucS 4 ccfsful BERM. celsful in the pursuit, it by no means followed, that happinels was to be the reward. For if happiness be, in truth, esfentially conneced with splendid fortune, or exalted rank, how comes it to pass, that many in the inferior stations of life, visibly spend their days with more comfort, than they who occupy the higher departments of the world ? Why does the beggar ting, while the King is fad ? A small meature of refiection on our nature might latist- us, that there are other principles of happiness or miftry, too often overlooked by the world, which immediately affect the heart, and operate there with greater force and power, than any circumitances of rank or fortune. This is the oblervation of the wile man in the text; and what I now purpose to illulrate. I ilall take a view of the chief fourccs of that biJttrnefi which the I,'rt niwetlh, and of that joy with uhicb I IJrainger diIilh nlt inlermcdd ; and then lhall point out the proper improvements to be made of the subject.

IF IF we inquire carefully into the sources 
of the joy or bitterness of the heart, we ,i., Ihall find, that they are chiefly two; that they arise either from a man own mind and temper; or, from the connection in which he stands with tome of his fellowcreatures. In other words, the circumstances which molt essentially affect every man happiness are, his peribnal character, and his iocial feelings.

I. EVERY man own mind and temper is, necessarily, to himself a iource of much inward joy or bitterness. For every man, if we may be allowed the exprelfion, is more connected with himself, than with any external object. He is constantly a companion to hitnilf in his own thoughts; and what he meets with there, must, of all things, contribute most to his happiness or his difiluiet. Whatever his condition in the world be, whether high or low, if he find no cauie to upbraid himlelf for his bchaviour; if he be satisfied that his conducl procecds upon a rational plan; if, 
amidst  amidt the failings incident to humanity, xM. his confiience be, in the main, free from reproach, and his mind undilturbed by any dilmal presages of futurity; the foundation is laid for a placid and agreeable tenor of life. If to this you add a calm and chearful temper, not easily fretted or difturbed, not lubjed to envy, nor prone to violent pallion, much of that joy will be produced, which it is said in the text, a flranger intermeddleth not with. For this is an intrinsic joy, independent of all foreign causes. The upright man, as it is written, is fatisid from hbnimlf. Undisturbed by the vexations of folly, or the remorse of guilt, his nights will be peaceful, and his days serene. His mind is a kingdom to itself. A good conscience, and good temper, prepare, even in the midlft of poverty, a contiwnalfeqft.

But how sadly will the scene be reversed, 
if the firit thoughts which occur to a man concerning himself, shall be of a gloomy and threatening kind; if his tcmptr, infead of calmness and felf-enjoyment, shall yield yield him nothing but disquiet and painful 
agitation ? In any situation of fortune, is _, it possible for him to be happy, whose mind is in this troubled state ? The spirit of a man will fiflain his ifirmities; but a wounded Jpirit, who can bear ? Vigour of mind, may enable a man to sustain many shocks of adversity. In his spirit, as long as it is found, he can find a resource, when other auxiliaries fail. But if that which should sustain him be enfeebled and broken; if that to which he has recourse for the cure of other sorrows, become itself the wounded part; to what quarter can he turn for relief?

The wounds which the spirit suffers are owing chiefly to three causes; to folly, to paflion, or to guilt. They frequently originate from folly; that is, from vain, and improper pursuits, which, though not dire&ly criminal, are unsuitable to a man age, character, or condition, in the world.
In consequence of these, he beholds himself degraded and exposed; and suffers the pain of many a mortifying refletion, and many ERM . many a humbling comparison of himself XslL. with others. The dittrels occalioncd by a sense of folly, is aggravated by any violent pailon being allowed to take policlion of the heart. Even though it be of the class of those which are reckoned innocent, yet, if it have entirely leizcl and overpowered ; man, it deltroys his tranquillity, and brings his mind into a perturbed state.
But if it be a passion of the black and vicious kind, it is futficient to blast the most flouriihing condition, and to poison all his joys. If to thole wounds infliced by folly, or by passion, you add the wound of guilt, the remorie and fear produced by criminal deeds, you fill up the measure of pain, and bitterness of heart. Often have the terrors of conscience occasioned inward paroxyfins, or violent agitations of mind.
A dark a nd threatening cloud teems, to the conicious linner, to be hanging over his head. He who believes himself despised, or hated, by men, and who dreads, at the fane time, an avenging God, can derive little pleasure from the external comforts of life.

life. The bitterness of his heart infufcs itself into every draught which pleaiure of- i sers to his lips.

The external misfortunes of life, difapi pointments, poverty, and sickness, are nothing in comparison of those inward difireffes of mind, occasioncd by folly, by pallion, and by guilt. They may indeed prevail in different degrees, according as one or other of those principles of bitternets is predominant. But they are seldom parted far asunder from one another; and when, as it too often happens, all the three are complicated, they complete the misery of man. The disorders of the mind, having then arisen to their height, become of all things the moll dreadful. The ihame of folly, the violence of passion, and the remorse of guilt, acting in conjunction, have too frequently driven men to the last and abhorred refuge, of seeking relief in death from a life too embittered to be any longer endured. I proceed to confider  OTHER troubles, and other joys of the  the heart, arising from Iburces different . . from those that I have now described; 
founded in the relations or connecdions which we have with others, and springing from the feelings which there occifion.
Such causes of sorrow or joy are of an external nature. Religion does not teach, that all the Iburces of inward pleasure or pain are derived from our temper, and moral behaviour. These are indeed the principal springs of bitterness or joy. In one way or other, they asset all the pleasures and pains of life; but they include not, within themselves, the whole of them. Our Creator did not intend, that the happinels of each individual should have no dependence on those who are around him. Having connected us in society by many ties, it is his decree, that there ties should prove, both during their subsistence, and in their dissolution, causes of pleasure or pain, immediately, and often deeply, affecting the human heart. My dotrine, therefore, is not, that the bitternef wubicb the heart knoweth as it: own, and the joy with which a ralnger 5franger intermeddkflh *ot, is independent of  1 every thing external. What I assert is, .
that this bitternefi, and this jy', depend much more on other causes, than on riches or poverty, on high or low itations in the world; that, equally in the conditions of elevated fortune, and of private life, the moOt material circumstances of tronble or felicity, next to the [Fate of our own mind and temper, are the ienfations and assections which arise from the connetions we have with others.

IN order to make this appear, let us sup.

pose a man, in any rank or condition of life, happy in his family and his friends; soothed by the cordial intercourse of kind affections, which he partakes with them; enjoying the comfort of doing them good offices, and receiving in return their sincereft gratitude; experiencing no jealousy nor envy, no disquiet or alienation of asfction, among those with whom he is connected ;- how many, and how copious sources of invward joy open to such a man How RM. How finooth is the tenor of a life that proI__I ceeds in such a course! What a smiling asped does the love of parents and children, of brothers and fillers, of friends and relations, give to every surrounding objet, and every returning day ! With what a lutfre does it gild even the small habitation where such placid intercourse dwells; where such scenes of heartfelt satisfaction succeed uninterruptedly to one another!

But let us suppose this joyful intercourse to be broken off, in an untimely hour, by the cruel hand of the last foe; let us imagine the family, once so happy among themselves, to behold the parent, the child, or the spouse, to whom their hearts were attached by the tendereft ties, stretched on the cold bed of death; then, what bitterness does the heart know ! This, in the ftri'teft sense, is its own bitterness; from which it is not in the power of any external circumstance whatever to afford it relief. Amidst those piercing griefs of the heart, all ranks of life are levelled; all diftin&tions of fortune are forgotten. Unavailing availing arc the trophies of splendid woe, 
with which riches deck the fatal couch, to _ _'
give the leaf comfort to the mourner. The prince, and the peasant, then equally feel their own bitterness. Dwelling on the melancholy remembrance of joys that arc past and gone, the one forgets his poverty; the other despises the gilded trappings of his ltate. Both, in that fad hour, are fully lenfble, that on the favours of fortune it depends not to make man happy in this world.

But it is not only the death of friends, 
which, in the midst of a seemingly profperous state, is able to bring diitrefs home to the heart. From various failures in their conduct when living, arises much of the inward uneasiness we susser. It will, in general, be found, that the behaviour of those among whom we live in near connection, is, next to personal charater and temper, the chief source, either of the pleafures, or of the disquietudes, of every man life. As, when their behaviour is cordial and fatisfacory, it is of all external things  ll. the  the inof soothing to the mind ; so, on the XIII.
Lry-- other hand, their levity, their inattention, 
or occasional harllnefs, even though it proceed to no deciled breach of fricndflip, yet ruffles and sirets the temper. Social life, harassed with those petty vexations, resembles a road which a man is doomed daily to travel; but finds it rugged, and flony, and painful to be trod.

The cafe becomes much worst, if the base and criminal conduc of perfins whom we have once loved, dissolve all the bonds of amity, and flow that our confidence has been abused. Then are opened, some of the dccpelt springs of bitterness in the human heart. - Behold the heart of the parent, torn by the unworthy behaviour, and cruel ingratitude of the child, whom lie had trained up with the fondest hopes; on whom he had laviflied his whole assection ; and for whoe fake lie had laboured and toiled, through the course of a long life.
Behold the endearments of the conjugal slate changed into black suspicion, and miftrust; the affeclionate spouse, or the virtuous tuous husband, left to mourn, with a bro- 
ken heart, the infidelity of the once-beloved  
partner of their life. Behold the unfifpecing fiiend betrayed, in the hour of danger, by the friend in whom he trulted; or, in the midst of severe misfortune, meeting nothing but cold indifference, perhaps scorn and contempt, where he had expeted to find the kindest fvmpathy.- Are these, let me ask, uncommon scenes in the world ? Are such distresses peculiar to any rank or station ? Do they chiefly befall persons in humble life, and have the great any prerogative which affords them exemption ? When the heart is sorely wounded by the ingratitude or faithleffilefs of those on whom it had leaned with the whole'
weight of affection, where shall it turn for relief? Will it find comfort in the recollection of honours and titles, or in the contemplation of surrounding treafurcs ?-.Talk not of the honours of a court. Talk not of the wealth of the east. These, in the hours of hcart-bitternefs, are spurned, as contemptible and vile; perhaps cursed,  2 as  as indireA causes of the present difrefi.
Xli. The dart has made its way to the heart.

There, there, it is fixed. The very feat of feeling is assailed; and in proportion to the sensibility of the sufferer heart, and the tenderness of his affecions, such, unfortunately, will be his degree of anguiih.
A good conscience, and hope in God, may indeed bring him consolation. But under such distresses of the heart, as I have described, fortune, be it as flourishing as you will, is no more than an empty pageant. It is a feeble reed, which affords no support. It is a house of straw, which is scattered before the wind.

THUS you fee this dodrine meeting us from many quarters, that the heart knows a bitterness and a joy of its own, altogether diffind from tie uneasiness or the pleasure that is produced by the circumstances of external fortune; arising either from perfonal character, and the state of a. man own mind; or from the affecions excited by the relations in which he stands to others.

This This joy, and this bitterness, are, each of 
them, of so much greater consequence than _ any diftintions of fortune, that blessed with the former, one may be happy, as far as human happiness goes, in a cottage; and afflided with the latter, he must be miserable in a palace.- Let us now proceed to an important part of the subject, the practical improvement to which this doctrine leads.

FIRST, Let it serve to moderate our passion for riches, and high situations in the world. It is wel known, that the eager pursuit of these is the chief incentive to the crimes that fill the world. Hence, among the middle and lower ranks of men, all the fraud, falsehood, and treachery, with which the competition for gain infeCts society.
Hence, in the higher stations of the world, all the atrocious crimes flowing fiom ambition, and the love of power, by which the peace of mankind has so often been broken, and the earth stained with blood.
Had tlhee coveted advantages the power,  3 when  when obtained, of ensuring joy to the XIII  heart, and rendering it a stranger to bitterness, some apology might be offered for the violence to which they have given occafion. The prize might be supposed worthy of being acquired at a high expence, when so much depended on the attainment. But I have Ihown, I hope with fatisfaAory evidence, that the contrary is the truth. I fay not, that the advantages of fortune deserve no regard from a wife or a good man. Poverty is always distressing.
Opulence and rank are both attended with many comforts, and may be rendered subservient to the most valuable purposes. But what I fay is, that it is a great error to rate them beyond their just value. Secondary advantages, inferior afliftances to felicity, they are; and no more. They rank below every thing that immediately assets the heart; and that is a native source of joy or bitterness there. If a man be either unhappy in his dispositions, or unhappy in all his connecions, you heap upon him in vain, all the treaiures, and all the honours, 
which which kings can bcetow. Divest thef ERM.
things, then, of that fallc glare which the i opinions of the multitude throw around them. Contemplate them with a more impartial eye. Iurlle them with less cagernels. Above all, never sacrifice to the pursuit any degree of probity or moral worth, of candour or good affetion; if you would not lay a foundation for that bitterness of heart, which none of the goods of fortune can either compensate or cure.

SECONDLY, Let the observations which have been made, correct our mistakes, and check our complaints, concerning a fuppoled promiscuous diltribution of happiness in this world. The charge of injustice, which lb often, on this account, bath been brought againit Providence, refts entirely on this ground, that the happiness and mifery of men may be eflimated by the degree of their external proiperity. This is the delusion under which the multitude have always laboured; but which a just consideration of the invisible springs of hapT 4 piness SER piness that affcl the heart, is sufficient to xii. cjrrc. If you would judge whether a man be really happy, it is not solely to bi1 houses and his lands, to his equipage and lus retinue, you are to look. Unless you could fee farther, and discern what joy, or what bitterness, his heart feels, you can pronounce nothing concerning him. That proud and wicked man, whom you behold lurrounded with Uate and splendour, and upon whom you think the favours of Heaven so improperly lavilhed, may be a wretch, pining away in lecret, with a thousand griefs unknown to the world. That poor man, who appears negleted and overlooked, may, in his humble station, be partaking of all the moral, and all the social joys, that exhilarate the heart; may be living chearful, contented, and happy.
Cease, then, to murmur against difpenfations of Providence, which are, to us, tb imperfedly known. Envy not the prosperity of finners. Judge not of the real condition of men, from what floats. merely on the surface of their state. Let  rather, 

THIRDLY, Turn our attention to those 
internal sources of happiness or misery, on XII.
which it hath been Ihown that fb much depends. As far as the bitterness or joy of the heart arises from the first of thoie great springs which I assigned to it, our own conduct and temper, so far our happiness is placed, in some measure, in our own hands. What is amiss or disordered within, in consequence of folly, of pailion, or guilt, may be rectified by due care, under the afliftance of divine grace. He who thereby attains to a tranquil and composed state of heart, free from ill humour and disgust, from violent passions, and from vexing remorse, is laying a foundation for enjoyment of himself, much furer and broader, than if he were amafing thousands to increase his estate.

With regard to the other spring of joy or bitterness of heart, arising from our connections with others, here indeed, we are more dependent on things not within our power. These connections are not always of our own forming; and even when they  they have been formed by choice, the wisest JXII. are liable to be disappointed in their expectations. Yet here too it will be found, that the proper regulation of the heart is of the utmost importance, both for improving the joys which our situation affords, and for mitigating the griefs which our connections may render unavoidable. As far as the choice of friends or relatives depends on ourselves, let their virtue and worth ever dire& that choice, if we look for any lasting felicity from it. In all the habits and attachments of bfcial life, after they are formed, let it be our study, to fulfil properly our own part. Let nothing be wanting on our  to nourith that mutual harmony and affectionate friendship which, in every situation of life, as has been Ihown, is of so great consequence to our peace and satisfaction. It is not, indeed, in our power to preserve always alive those friends, in whom our hearts delight. It is often not in our power to prevent the ingratitude and unworthy behaviour of other friends, from whom we once expected comfort. But under under those afflicting incidents of life, ER 
much may be done by proper employment xtI.
of the thoughts, and direction of the assections, for obtaining relief. To a purified and well-regulated heart, reason and religion can bring many aids for healing its wounds, and rctoring its peace; aids which, to the negligent and vicious, are wholly unknown. The greater experience we have of the viciflitudes of human life, with more weight will that precept of the wife man always come home to our remembrance; Keep thy heart with all diligence; for ut of it are te iues of lfe *.- Hence arises, 
IN the fourth and last place, another initruction, that it is of the utmost importance to us all, frequently to look up to Him who made the human heart; and to implore his afliftance in the regulation and government of it. Known to him, are all the sources of bitterness and joy by which it is affected. On him it depends, to let Prov. ;>. 23.

them  them forth, or to ihut them up; to inA . crease, or to diminith them, at his pleasure. In a study so infinitely important to happiness, as that of the preservation of inward peace, we cannot be too earnest in beseeching aid from the great Father of Spirits, to enable us to keep our hearts free from distress and trouble.- Besides the assistance which we may hope to derive from divine grace, the employments of devotion tbemfclves, form one of the most powerful means of composing, and tranquillifing the heart. On various occasions, when the sources of heart-bitternefs have been most overflowing, devotion has been found the only refuge of the sufferer. Devotion opens a fanduary, to which they, whose hearts have been most deeply wounded, can always fly. Within that quiet and sacred retreat, they have often found a healing balsam prepared. When grieved by men, they have derived, from the ascent of the mind towards God and celestial objecs, much to tooth them at present, and much to hope for in future. Let us, therefore, neglect no mean with which religion .



can furnith us, for promoting the joys, and afluaging the bitterness of the heart. Amidst the frailties of our nature, the inconftancy of men, and the frequent changes of human life, we shall find every assistance that can be procured, little enough, for enabling us to pass our few days with tolerable comfort and peace.

# SERMON XIV. On CHARACTERS of IMPERFECT GOODNESS. MARK,  21. Then Jesus, beholding him, loved him. Â—




On CHARACTERS of IMPERFECT GOOD
Then Jesu, beholding him, loved him. . characters of men which the world __ presents to us are infinitely diversificd.

In some, either the good or the bad qualities are so predominant, as firongly to mark the character; to discriminate one person as a virtuous, another as a vicious man.
In others, these qualities are so mixed together, as to leave the character doubtful.
The light and the shade are so much blended, the colours of virtue and vice run in such a manner into one another, that we can can hardly distinguish where the one ends, 


and the other begins; and we remain in __ fufpence, whether to blame or to praise.
While we admire those who are thoroughly good, and detest the grossly wicked, it is proper also to bestow attention on those imperfect characters, where there may be much to praise, and somewhat to blame; and where regard to the commendable part, shall not hinder us from remarking what is defective or faulty. Such attentions will be found the more useful, as characters of this mixed fort are, more frequently than any other, exhibited to us in the commerce of society.

It was one of this fort, which gave occasion to the incident recorded in the text. The incident seems to have been confidered as remarkable, since it is recounted by three of the evangelical writers; and by them all, with nearly the fame circumstances. The person to whom the history relates was a ruler; one of higher rank and station than those who usually resorted to Jesus. He was a rich man: He was a young man. His whole  whole behaviour was prepoflefling and en.
XlV, gaging. He appears to have conceived a high opinion of our Lord. He addrefled him with the utmft refpe and the question which he put to him was proper and importnt. He kneeld to him; andfaid, Good Ma/or, What Jball I do that I may inherit eternal lft His conduct in the world had been regular and decent He could protft, that he had hitherto kept himfeif free from any gross vice; and in his dealings with others, had observed the precepts of God. Our Lord, beholding him, is said to have loved him; whence we have reason to conclude, that he was not hypocritical in his professions; and that his countenance carried the expression of good dispositions, as his speech, and his manners, were altogether complacent and gentle. Yet this person, amiable as he was, when his virtue was put to the test, disappointed the hopes which he had given reason to form. Attached, in all probability, to the indulgence of cafe and pleasure, he wanted fortitude of mind to part with the advantages of the world, 
world, for the fake of reliion. When our sr. 
Lord required him to tultil his good intelltions, by riliinquillling his fortule, becoinig one of his follovcrs, and preparing himllff to encounter uilriilngs, the lacrilice alpcarcd to Iilm too great. Imprclhous of virtue, however, llill remained on his mind. Ile was lenfible of what he ought to have done; and regretted his want of courage to do it. He w7s rJlrro.fil: He war grieved: Yet he wZLnt away.

PERSONS of a character fomcwhat refeinbling this, all of us may have met with; eliecially, among the young; among those who have been liberally educated, and polilhed by good society. They abhor open vice, and crimes that ditlurb the world. They have a refipec for religion.
They are willing to receive initrucion for their conduc. They are modelt and unassuming; rclipcctthl to their superiors in age or station; gentle in their address; inoffenfivc and courteous in their whole behaviour. They are fond of obliging every  III. one;   one; unwilling to hurt or dilpleafe any.
Such persons we cannot but love. We gladly promise well of them; and are difposed to forward and affilt them. Yet such is the weakness of our nature, that at the bottom of this character there may lie, as we fee exemplified in the inttance before us, some secret and material defects. That vigour of mind, that firmness of principle, may be wanting, which is requisite for enabling them to with propriety, when their virtue is put to a decisive trial. The softness of their nature is unfavourable to a feady perseverance in the course of integrity. They possess the amiable qualities; but there is ground to fufped, that in the estimable ones they are deficient. While, therefore, we by no means class them among the bad, we dare not give them the full praiIe of virtue. When they set out in the workl, we cannot pronounce with confidence, what confirmed features their characer will aflume; nor how far they can be depended upon, in future life. Allow me now to point out the dangers which such iuch persons are mos likely to incur; and 8E RM.
to ihow what is requisite for them farther to study, in order to their fulfilling the part of good men and true Christians.

I. PERSONS of this description are not qualified for discharging aright many duties, to which their Sitnation in life may call them. In certain circumstances, they behave with abundance of propriety. When all is calm and smooth around them; when nothing occurs to agitate the mind, or to disturb the tenor of placid life, none of their defects come forward. They are beloved; and they are useful. They promote the comfort of human society; and, by gentleness, and courtesy of manners, serve to cement men together in agreeable union.
But to fail on the tranquil surface of an unruffled lake, and to steer a safe course through a troubled and stormy ocean, require different talents: and alas! human life oftener refernbles the flormy ocean, than the unruffled lake. We shall not have been long embarked, without findU 2  the resemblance to hold too clofcXIV.

Amidst the bustle of the world, amidst the open contentions, and secret enmities, which prevail in every society, mildness and gentleness alone, are not iufficient to carry us, with honour, through the duties of our different stations; as heads of families, citizens, fabjets, magistrates, or as engaged in the pursuits of our several callings. Disturbances and trials arise, which demand vigorous exertions of all the moral powers; of patience, vigilance, and selfdenial; of constancy and fortitude, to support us under danger and reproach; of temperance, to restrain us from being carried away by pleasure; of firm and determined principle, to make us dcfpile the bribes of fin. These manly dispositions of mind are indifpcnfably necessary to prepare one, for surmounting the discouragements of virtue; and for firuggling honourably through the hardships of life. Unless he be thus armed and fortified, whatever good intentions have been in his heart, they are likely likely to be frustrated in ac'ion. Nothing 
that is great, can be undertaken. Nothing *.
that is dificult or hazardous, can be accomplilhed. Nor arc we to imagine, that it is only in times of perlrcution, or war, or civil commotions, that there is occasion for thoie ilronger efforts, tholfe malculine virtues of the ioul, to be displayed. The private, and seemingly quiet, stations of life, often call men forth, in the days of peace, to severe trials of firmness and conflancy.
The life of very few proceeds in so uniform a train, as not to oblige them to discover, in tome situation or other, what portion they possess of the cftimable qualities of man. Hence it lometimes happens, that perlons, whole manners were much less promising and cngaging than thole of others, have, neverthelels, when brought to ac a part in critical circumstances, performed that part with more untillhed honour, and firmer integrity, than they.
  I'ERSONS of the character I have dccribed are ill fitted, not only for dilcharging the higher duties of life, but allb for 3 rcfilting . refiting the common temptations to vice.
X1V. With good dispositions in their mind, with a desire, like the young ruler in the text, to know what they shall do, in order to in.
berit eternal life; yet, when the terms required of them interfere with any favourite enjoyment, like him, they are sorrow.
.fl; and go away. The particular trial to which he was put, may appear to be a hard one, and to exceed the ordinary rate of virtue. Our Lord, who discerned his heart, saw it to be necessary, in his cafe, for bringing his character to the tell. But in cafes, where trials of much less difficulty present themselves, they who partake of a charaCter funilar to his, are often found to give way. The good qualities which they possess, border on certain weaknesses of the mind; and these weaknesses are apt to betray them insensibly into vices, with which they are connected.

Good nature, for instance, is in danger of running into that unlimited complaifance, which assimilates men to the loose manners of those whom they find around them. Pliant, and yielding in their their temper, they have not force to fiand 



by the decisions of their own minds, with regard to right and wrong. Like the animal which is said to assume the colour of every objeft to whlich it is applied, they lose all proper character of their own; and are formed by the characters of those with whom they chance to aflociate.-The mild are apt to fink into habits of indolence and sloth. The chearful and gay, whae warmed by pleasure and mirth, lo that Iobriety and felf-denial, which is elcential to the support of virtue.-Even nodefty and fubmiiion, qualities so valuable in themselves, and so higlly ornamcntal to youth, sometimes 4egenerate into a vicious timidity; a timidity which refirains men from doing their duty with firmness; which cannot stand the frown of tle great, the reproach of the multitude, or even the ridicule and fncer of the icorner.

Nothing can be more amiable than a constant desire to please; and an unwillingness to offend or hurt. Yet in characcrs where this is a predominant feature, fecls are often found. Fond always to obxlv lige, and afraid to utter any disagreeable - truth, fluch persons are lometimes led to dissemble. Their love of truth is lacrificed to their love of pleating. Their speech, and their manners, allune a tfhdied coultefy.
You cannot always depend on their finile; nor, when they promile, be ;ure of the performance. 'They mean and intend well.
But the good intention is tempolrary. Like wax, they yield cafily to every inpreffion; and the transient friendihip contracted with one person, is efli;ccd by the next. Undiftinguilhing dclirc to oblige, often proves, in the pr' lcnt fate of human things, a dangerous: haliit. hey who cannot, on many occalions, give a lirn and steady denial, or who cannot break olf a connecion, which lias i)en hallily and improperly formed, itand on the brink of many mischiefs.
Thec will be ieduced by the corrupting, cnlill'cd by the artful, betrayed by thole iii whom tlhey had placed their trult. UnI'lfpicious thcrnlfilves, they were flattered 'irh the i)licn of havilng many friends around round them. Elated with fmtluine hopes, SERiM.
and chearful fpilits, the, reckoned, that to-  morrow wldi be a this dai), and mnre abunldant. Injudicious liberality, and thoughtlels profulion, are the coniequence; until, in the end, the Illaits to which they are reduced, bring them into mean or diihonourable courses. Through innocent, hut unguarded weakness, and fiom want of the leverer virtues, they are, in proceis of time, betrayed into downright crimes. Such may be the conclusion of those, who, like the young ruler before us, with many amiable and promising dispositions, had begun their career in life.

III. Sucn persons are not prepared for sustaining, with propriety and dignity, the difireflcs to which our (late is liable. They were equipped for the ibafon' of tiinflinc and tl renity ; but whcn the iky is overcall, .nd the days of darkness come, their feeble minds are destitute of Ihclter, and ill provided for defence. Then is the time, when more hardy qualities are required; when courage 8ER  courage must face danger, constancy sup  port pain, patience possess itself in the midst of discouragements, magnanimity dilplay its contempt of threatenings. If those high virtues be altogether llrangers to the mind, the mild and gentle will certainly fink under the torrent of difafters.-The ruler in the text could plead, that his behaviour to others, in the course of social life, had been unexceptionable. So far, the reflection on his conduct would afford him comfort amidst adversity. But no man is without failings. In the dejecting season of trouble, it will occur to every one, that he has been guilty of frequent tranfgreflion; that much of what ought to have been done, was neglected; and that much of what has been done, had better have been omitted. In such situations, when a thousand apprehensions arise to alarm conscience, nothing is able to quiet its uneasiness, except a well-grounded trust in the mercy and acceptance of Heaven. It is firm religious principle, acting upon a manly and enlightened mind, that gives dignity to the character, and composure to the heart, under all the troubles of the world. This enables the brave and virtuous man, with success to buffet the storm. While he, who had once sparkled in society with all the charms of gay vivacity, and had been the delight of every circle in which he was engaged, remains dispirited, overwhelmed, and annihilated, in the evil day.

SUCH are the failings incident to persons of mixed and imperfet goodness: such the defects of a character formed merely of the amiable, without the cftimable qualities of man.

It appears from this, that we must not place too much trust in the fair appearances, which a charater may at first exhibit. In judging of others, let us always think the best, and employ the spirit of charity and candour. But in judging of ourselves, we ought to be more severe. Let us remember him whom our Lord beheld, and lkved; and who yet fell short of the kingdom of heaven. Let us not forget, that loimetllinqg more tlian gentleness and XIV   _, modelty, than complacency of temper and altli'iiity of mantlcr  is requisite to form a worthv man, or a true Chritian. To a hilgh place in our eftecm, these qualities are jultly intitled. They enter cifeitiiall into every good man characfer. They form some of its moll favourable diltinctions.
But they constitutc a part of it; not the whole. Let us not, therefore, rcll on them entirely, when we conceive an idea of what manner of persons we ought to be.

LET piety form the basis of firm and established virtue. If this be wanting, the character cannot be found and entire. Moral virtue will always be endangered, often be overthrown, when it is separated from its lilrelt filpport. Confidence in God, lrcnthlened by faith in the great Redeemer of mankind, not only, amidst the ieverer trials of virtue, gives conitancy to the min  but, by nourilhing the hope of immortality, adds warmth and elevation to the aflec'ions. They whose conduct is not animated animated by religious principle, are deprived of the molt powerful incentive to wor- _ thy and honourable deeds.

Let fich difciplinc, next, be studied, as may form us to the active and manly virtues. To natural good affcctions, we can never entirely trull our conduct. These, as has been llown, may Ibmctimes be warped into what is wrong; and often will prove insufficient, for carrying us rightly through all the duties of life. Good assections are highly valuable; but they mult he flipportcd bv fixed principles, cultivated in the underlianding, and rooted in the heart. lHabits nufi be acquired of temperance and felf-denial, that we may be able to refill pleasure, and endure pain, when either of them interfere with our duty; that we may be prepared to make a facrifice of any worldly interest, when the voice of God and conscience demand it. Let us always remember, that without fortitude of mind, there is no manhood; there can be no perseverance in virtue. Let a tcred and inviolable regard for truth reign in our  our whole behaviour. Let us be diftinxlVJ guilhed for fidelity to every promise we have made; and for constancy in every worthy friendihip we have formed. Let no weak conplailance, no undue regard to the opinions of men, ever make us betray the rights of confcicnce. What we have once, upon due consideration, adopted as rules of conduct, to these let us adhere unlhaken. However the world may change around us, let it find us the fame in profperity and adversity; faithful to God and virtue; faithful to the convidions of our own heart. What our lot in the world may be, is not ours to foresee or determine.
But it is ours to resolve, that whatever it Ihall be, it ihall find us persevering in one line of uprightness and honour.

BY such discipline, such attentions as these, we are to guard against those fail.
ings, which are fibmetimes found to stain the molt engaging characers. Joining in proper union the amiable and the estimable qualities, by the one we fliall attract the good; and by the other, command rcfpec from the bad. We shall both secure our _ own integrity, and fihall exhibit to others a proper view of what virtue is, in its native grace and majesty. In one part of our character, we lhall resemble the flower that smiles in spring; in another, the firmlyrooted tree, that braves the winter storm.
For, remember we mult, that there is a feablo of winter, as well as of spring and summer, in human life; and it concerns us to be equally prepared for both.

A higher and more perfect example of such a character as I now recommend, cannot be found, than what is presented to us in the life of Jesus Christ. In him, we behold all that is gentle, united with all that is refpeftable. It is a remarkable expression, which the Apostle Paul employs concerning him; I befeecb you by the meeknesS and gentlenefi of Chril *. Well might these qualities be singled out, as those for which he was known and diftinguiihed.



We RM. We fee him in his whole behaviour affable, .__, courteous, and ealy or access. He converted familiarly with all who preflnted themselves; and defpiled not the meanett.
With all the infirmities of his disciples he calmly bore; and his rebukes were mild, when their provocations were great. He wept over the calamities of his country, which persecuted him; and apologised and prayed for them who put him to death.
Yet the fame Jesus we behold, awful in the ftridtnefs of his virtue; inflexible in the cause of truth; uncomplying with prevailing manners, when he found them corrupt; setting his face boldly against the hypocritical leaders of the people; overawed by none of their threatenings; in the molt indignant terms, reproving their vices, and itigmatizing their characters.
We behold him gentle, without being tame; firm, without being stern; courageous, without being violent. Let this mind be in us wbich was alo in JeJus Cbrif; and we shall attain to honour, both with God and with man.

# SERMON  On the SACRAMENT of the LORD SUPPER, as a PREPARATION for DEATH. Preached at the Celebration of the Sacrament of the Lord Supper. MATTHEW, xxvi. 29. But I say unto you, I will not drink ...


On the SACRAMENT of the LORD SUPPER, as a PREPARATION for DEATH.
Preched at the Celebration of the Sacrment of the Lord Supper.

MATTHEW, xxvi. 29.

But Ifay unto you, I will not drilk henceforth of tbi fruit of the vine, until that day vwen I. drink it new with you in my Fatber kingdom.
WITH these words of our blesed Lord, the Evangelist concludes his account of the institution of the sacrament of the Supper. It is an institution which, solemn and venerable in itself, is rendered still more so, by the circumstances which accompanied  III. it,   it. Our Lord had now, for about three iL_-_ years, continued 1' appear in his public character, in the land of Judea. He had, all along, been watched with a jealous eye, by his enemies; and tie time was come, when they were to prevail against him. A few friends he had, from lhe, beginning, flec'led, who, in every vicillitude of his tdttc, remained faithfully attached to him.
Witl thele friends he was now meeting for the lail time, on the very evening in which he was betrayed and seized. He perfetly knew all that was to befal him. He knew that this was the last meal in which he was to join with those, who had been the companions of all his labours, the confidedt of all his griefs; among whom he had passed all the quiet and private moments of his life.
He knew, that within a few hours, he was to be torn from this loved society, by a band of ruffians; and by to-morrow, was to be publicly arraigned, as a malefactor With a heart melting with tenderneif, he said to the twelve Apostles, as he fat down with them at table, With defre I have deired te Is eat this pafover with ;'9 befire ftier. 


And then, having gratified himself for the lall time in their fociery, and having inftituted that commemoration of his death which was to continue in the Christian church until the end of ages, he took a solemn and affetionate farewel of his friends, in the words of the text, Ifay unto you, tbat I will not drink bencefirtb of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father kingdom.

As these words were uttered by our Lord, in the profped of his sufferings'; when preparing himself for death, and looking forward to a future meeting with his ends in heaven; let us, under this view; confider the sacrament, which he then intituted, as a preparation for all the sufferings of life, and especially, a preparation for death. It is fit and proper, that such folernn profpeds should enter into the service which we are this day to perform.
We have no reason to imagine, that they * Luik, mii. 15.
 will  will render it a gloomy service. A good _--^_ and wife man is often disposed to look forward to the termination of life. The number of our days is determined by God; and certainly it will not tend to Ihorten their number, that we employ ourselves in preparing for death. On the contrary, while our days last, it will tend to make us pass them more comfortably, and more wifely.
Let us now then, as if for the last time we were to partake of this sacrament, confider how it may serve to prepare us for the dying hour.

I. IT is a high exercise of all those difpofitions and affections, in which a good man would wish to die. He would surely wish to leave this world, in the spirit of devotion towards God, and of fellowflip and charity with all his brethren on earth.
Now, these are the very sentiments, which the sacrament of the Lord Supper inspires into the heart of every pious communicant. It includes the higher ats of devotion of which human nature is capable. It imports, a lively fcnfe of the 
finite mercies ot Heaven; of the gratitude _ .
we owe to that God, who, by the death of his Son, hath reltored the forfeited happiness and hopes of the humlan ce. It imports, the consecration of the foul to Lod; the entire rcfignation of ourlilvcs, and all our concerns, into his hands; as to the God whom we serve and love; the guardian in whom we confide. To thee, 0 Lord, do lift up njmyfol. I willgo to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy. I will come into thy booke in the multitude of thy mercy; and in thy fear, I will worJhip towards thy hol/ temple *.

These devout affecions towards GCod are, 
on this occasion, necetlarily accompanied with benevolent dilpofitions towards men.
Our communion is not only with God, but with one another. In this solemn service, the diitinction of ranks is abolilhcd. We assemble in common before our great Lord, professing ourselves to be all members of his family, and children of the fame Father. No feud, nor strife, nor enrtity, is permitted to approach the sacred table. All within that hallowed space breathes peace, and concord, and love. If thou bring thy gif? to the altar, and Btre rememberrcf that thy brother bath ought agai thee; leav there ehy gift bfore the altar, and go thy way; firfi be reconciled to tby brother; and then come and offer thy gift *. What can be more becoming men and Christians, than such sentiments of piety to the great Father of the univcrfe; gratitude to the merciful Redeemer of mankind; and charity and forgivcnefs towards all our brethren? Is not this the temper in which a good man would wish to live? more especially, is not this the frame of mind which will give both dignity and peace to his last moments? How discomposed and embittered will these important moments prove, if, with a mind toured by the remembrance of unforgiven injuries, with a breast rankled by enmity, with a heart alienated from God, and insensible to devotion, one be forced away from life?


Contemplate Contemplate the manner in which our blessed Lord died; which the lervice of this  day brings particularly into your view.
You behold him, amidit the extremity of pain, calm and collected within himself; poffefiing his spirit with all the fcrenity which sublime devotion, and exalted benevolence inspire. You hear him, first, lamenting the fate of his unhappy country; next, when he was fastened to die cross, addressing words of consolation to his asslided parent; and lastly, fending up prayers, mixed with compaifionate apologies, for those who were Ihedding his blood.
After all those exercises of charity, you behold him in an of devout adoration and trust, resigning his breath; Father, into thy hands I commend myJpirit.- Can any death be pronounced unhappy, how distressful soever its circumstances may be, which is thus supported, and dignified ? What could we wifl for more in our last moments, than with this peaceful frame of mind, this calm of all the afficions, this exaltation of heart 4 towards 8E RM. towards God, this diffusion of benevolence XVY Â· , towards men, to bid adieu to the world?

If, in such a spirit as this, we would all wish to die, let us think, that now is the time to prepare for it, by seasonably cultivating this spirit while we live; by imbibing, in particular, from the holy sacrament, those dispositions and affecions which we would with to possess at our latest period. It is altogether vain to imagine, that when the hour of death approaches, we ihall be able to form ourselves into the frame of mind which is then mofl proper and decent. Amidit the ftruggles of nature, and under the load of sickness or pain, it is not time for unaccuftomed exertions to be made, or for new reformations to be begun. Suficient, and more than sufficient, for that day is the evil thereof. It will be too late to assume then the hero, or the faint, if we have been totally unacquainted with the character before.
The sentiments we would display, and the language we would utter, will be alien and firange to us. They will be forced, and soreign reign to the heart. It is only in confe- 


quence of habits acquired in former and better days, that a temper of piety and charity can grow up into such strength, as to confer peace and magnanimity on the concluding hours of life. Peculiarly favourable to the acquisition of such a temper, are the devotions of this day. In this view, let us perform them; and study to be at the table of the Lord, what we would with to be when the summons of death fhal come.
  Tin sacrament becomes a preparatnl. ,. leath, by laying a foundation for iJ,,ac with God. What is important at the close of life, is not only the temper in which we leave tie world, but the fituarion in which we stand with refpet to that great Judge, before whom we are about to appear. This view of our situation is apt to escape us, during the ordinary course of life. Occupied with the affairs and concerns of this world; flattered by those illufive colours of innocence and virtue, in which 8ERM. which felf-love dresses up our character,  apprehenfiQns of guilt create little unearlnefi to the multitude of men. But, on the approach of death, their ideas change. As the inquisition of the supreme Judge draws nigh, remembered transgressions crowd upon the mind. Guilt becomes strongly realifed to the imagination; and alarms, before unknown, begin to arise. Hence that anxiety, in the profpet of a future invifible world, which is so often seen to attend the bed of death. Hence those various methods, which fuperltition has devised for quieting this anxiety; the trembling mind eagerly grasping every feeble plank on which it can lay hold; and flying for protection to the most unavailing aid. The stoutest spirits have been then known to bend; the proudest hearts, to be humbled.
They who are now most thoughtless about their spiritual concerns, may, perhaps, be in this state before they die.

The dispensation of grace, discovered in the gospel, affords the only remedy against those terrors, by the promise of pardon, extended tended to the penitent, through the merits 

of our Lord Jesus Christ It is the very ,_ offence of this sacrament, to exhibit this promised grace to mankind; My body wbicb was broken for you; my blood Jbed for many, for the remijon of fins. Here, iines from above, the ray of hope. Divine juffice, we are assured, is not inexorable. Divine mercy is accessible, to all who believe and repent. The participation of this sacrament, therefore, naturally imparts comfort to the worthy communicant; as it supposes, on his part, a cordial compliance with those terms, on which pardon is offered by the gospel to mankind.

I mean not to fay, that the participation of this sacrament, how pious and proper soever our difpofitons at the time may be, is, of itself, sufficient to ensure us of comfort at death. It were unwarrantable to flatter Christians, with hopes to this extent.
No single act of the mos fervent devotion can afford assured hopes of peace with Heaven, until these hopes be confirmed by the succeeding tenor of a good life. But what may 8ERM. may safely be asserted is, that communica*. ting in a proper manner, makes way for such hopes. It is an introduction to that Rate of reconciliation with God, which will give you peace in death. It is the beginning of a good course, which, if duly pursued, will make your latter end blefied. It is the entrance of the path of the juJ ; the morning of that light, which fhinetb more and more unto the perfeft day. For this holy sacrament is a professed renunciation of the vices and corruptions of the world. It is a professed dereliction of former evil habits; a solemn return, on our part, to God and virtue, under the firm trust, that God will, through Jesus Christ, show mercy to the frailties of the penitent. If you continue to support the character which you this day assume, the invisible world will no longer present to you a scene of terrors.
You will be comforted with the view of goodness and compafion, as predominant in the administration of the universe. Aster having finiihed a virtuous course, you will be able to look up to that God whom you you have worshipped, and to fay, I know RM.
in wbom I have trufied. Though I walk xY through the valley of the Jhadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me. Tay rod and thy fJiffl all comfort me.

III. THis sacrament prepares us for a happy death, by strengthening the connection between Christians, and Christ their Saviour. This is a connection which, in various ways, redounds to their benefit; and will be found particularly consolatory at the hourfof death. The awful majesty of Heaven is in danger of overwhelming the mind, in the feeble moments of depart. life. The reverence it inspires is mingled with fenlitions of dread, which might be too strong for us then to bear. When we look up to it, through a Mediator and Intercessor, that Majesty assumes a milder aspet, and appears to invite our approach.
Whatever, therefore, forms a connection with this great Mediator, this powerful friend and patron of the human race, must be most desirable to every one, especially to the BERM. the dying man. Now, this sacrament uxv. _-. nites us closely with him. It is the oath of our allegiance. It is the act of enlisting ourselves under the banner. of this divine Leader. Of course, it ftrcngthens our faith in him, as our guide through life, and our guardian and protector in death. It gives us a title to look up to him, under the confidence of that reciprocal engagement, which fidelity on the one hand is always understood to imply, of protection on the other.

His participation of our nature conveys a degree of encouragement, which we could derive from no being altogether celeflial, how gracious or benign soever. In our utmost extremity, we can have recourse to his sympathizing aid, who had experience both of the distresses of life, and of the terrors of death. We behold, in the text, with what firm tranquillity he looked forward to his approaching sufferings. Sincere attachment to our great Master, may be expected to infuse into us some degree of the fame happy composure of mind. It is is owing to our losing out of view this perftt model; to our following the crowd, and adopting the common spirit of the world, that we become mean-fpirited and base; servilely attached to life, and afraid to die. Did we, according to our engagements at the Lord table, keep our eye fixed on our divine Leader, and itudy to follow his steps, a portion of his spirit would descend upon us at the hour of death. It would be as the mantle of Elijah, falling on a chosen disciple; and would enable us, as it did Eliiha of old, to finite, and divide the waters. We believe our Saviour now to rule in the world of fpirita The grave, therefore, bars not his followers from access to him. In the grave, for our fake, he once lay down, that he might dispel the gloom which appears to us to cover that formidable mansion. In a short time he arose from it, in order to assure us, that the dark and narrow house was not to confine his followers for ever. By his death, he conquered death; and him that had the power of it; and his voice to us is, Because I live, ye /ball live alo. Hence, -__ as long as we preserve that attachment to him which we this day profess, we are furnifted with a variety of canfiderations proper for supporting us in the profpec of our difolution.-This leads me to observe,   THAT the sacrament of which we are to partake, prepares us for death, by confirming and enlivening our hope of immortality. In this sacrament, my friends, you a& for both worlds. As inhabitants of the earth, you are on this day to look forward, with care, to your future behaviour in it. For you are not, by any means, disengaging yourselves totally from this life, and its concerns. On the contrary, you are forming, and even strengthening, those connecions, which virtue requires you to maintain with your friends, and fellowcreatures around yoL.--At the ifme time, you are not to confider yourselves as citizens of earth only; but also as citizens of heaven. You are to recogniLe, on this occafion, your relation to a higher and better country, 
country, with which you are connected by the most sacred ties; and from which you derive those comforts and hopes, that will both purify your life, and render your death happy. The sacrament of the supper is, in this view, an ascent of the mind above terrestrial things. At the Lord table, we associate ourselves, in rome degree, with spirits of a more exalted order. We declare, that we are tending towards their society; and have fixed our final reft within the veil. This view of the inflitution, so comfortable to the last period of life, is plainly given us in the words of the text.
For it is worthy of particular observation, that, as soon as our Lord had instituted this sacrament, he straightway leads the thoughts of his disciples to a state of future existence. Employing that metaphorical Rfyle, which the occasion naturally suggested, he tells them, that though he was not henceforth to drink of the fruit of the vine on earth, yet a day was coming, when he was again to' drink it with them; to drink it, in bis Father kiigdom. Two diftint  III. ideas ERM. ideas are, in these words, presented to us.  One is, the abode into which our Saviour was to remove; bis Father kingdom. The other, the iociety which he was there to enjoy; with you, in my Father kingdom. These correspond to the two views, under which death is most formidable to men; both of which he intended to banish, by the infitution of this sacrament: firll, that death is a transition to a new and unknown world; and next, that it is a final feparation from all the friends whom we have loved on earth.

FIRST; if death terminates our existence here, the abode to which it translates the faithful followers of Christ, is the kingdom of his Father. The inflitution of this facrament dispels all the gloomy ideas of annihilation, of non-exiftcnce, of total darkness, which our imagination is ready to asfociate with the grave. We are here affured, that, to good men, death is not the close of being, but a change of slate; a removal, from a distant and obscure province of of the universe, into the city of God, 
the chief feat of their Father kingdom. _ They have every reason to believe, that the objects which are to meet them there, how new and unknown soever, lhall all be propitious and friendly. For into the kingdom of his Father, their Lord has declared, that he is entered as their forerunner.
I go to my Father, and your Fabter; to my God, and your God. In my Father house are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you. I will come again, and receive you to myself, that where I am, there ye may be alo.
What reasonings, what speculations, can have power to impart so much peace to the dying man, as a promise so direct and explicit, coming from him who is truth itself, and cannot lie ? If it were not Jo, I would have told you *. The profpet becomes still more chearing and relieving, when we include, 
THE other circumstance mentioned in John, xiv. 2.
  the  the text; the society to be enjoyed in that  future itate of being. With you, I Jball drink of the fruit of the vine in my Father kinr,  Inl how amiable a light does our Saviour here appear, looking forward to a future reunion with those beloved friends, whom he was now leaving, as to a circumstance which should increase both his own felicity and theirs, when they met again in a happier world ! Thus, in the molt assectionate manner, chearing their drooping and dejected ipirits; and, by a similar profpee, providing for the comfort of his followers in future generations, when they should be about to leave the world.

The exprelfions in the text plainly suggest a joyful intercourse among friends, who had been separated by death: and therefore seem to give much confirmation, to what has always been a favourite hope of good men; that friends stall know and recognife each other, and renew their former connecions, in a future state of existence.
How many pleating proiiects, does such an intimation open to tile mind! How much does does it tend to compensate the vanity of life, 


and to mitigate the sorrows of death ! For _ it is not to be denied, that one of the molt bitter circumstances attending death, is the final keparation from beloved friends. This is apt equally to wring the hearts of the dying, and the iurviving; and it is an anguilh of that fort, which dellcends most deeply into the virtuous and worthy breadt.
When, surrounded with an affcCtionate family, and weeping friends, a good man is taking his last adieu of all whom he held molt dear on earth; when, with a feeble voice, he is giving them his blessing, before he leaves them for ever; when, for the last time, he beholds the countenance, he touches the hand, he hears the voice, of the person nearefl his heart; who could bear this bitterness of grief, if no fiipport were to be minifecred by religious hope ? if there were no voice to whisper to our spirits, that hereafter we, and those whom we love, ihall meet again in a more blissful land?
--What higher view can possibly be given, of the benefit redounding from this 3 divine . divine intfitution, than its affording us conXV_ folation in fich situations of extreme distress, by realising to our fouls the belief of an immortal irate, in which all the virtuous and worthy ihall be reunited in the presence of their common Lord ?

Tllus I have set before you many confiderations, arising from the sacrament of our Lord flupper, which render it a proper preparation, not only for a good life, but for a comfortable and happy death.
The great improvement to be made of the subjea is, to bring to the altar of God such dispositions of heart, as may give us ground to hope for this blessed effect. Let us approach to the sacrament with the fame fcrioufnefs of frame, as if it were the last time we were ever to partake of it; as if we were now making provision for a journey to that land whence none return; as if we were never to drink, in this manner, of the fruit of the viln, urltil that day when we drink it, with thol whom we hIve loved, in our Father kiingtdom. -God only knows to whom whom this may be truly spoken! God knows who, of this assembly, ihall never  
have opportunity to approach again to the sacred table, and to meet with their brethren, on such an occasion, in the courts of the Lord house !-\VWhatever our doom is to be, whether we are appointed for life or for death, fich is the frame of mind which now best becomes, and will molt improve us, in partaking of the holy sacrament.

LET me caution you, before I conclude, 
against judging of the propriety of your disposition in this solemn of worihip, solely by the warmth of your affections, and the fervour of your devotion. This slate of heart, how desirable soever it may be, cannot be at all times poflcffed. It depends, in some measure, on natural fcnfibility. All are not equally endowed with warm and tender feelings. Even they who are susceptible of the highest degrees of pious and virtuous sensibility, cannot, on every occasion, command that happy temY 4 perature  perature of mind. We are not, therefore,  _ to judge unfavourably of ourfilves, if this be not always the privilege of our devotions. It is chiefly a sedate and compofed frame of spirit, that we mult tludy to cultivate; arising from grave and fober thoughts; from serious and penitent recolledtlon of past errors; from good purposes for the future; and from a deep fcnfe of the approaching events of death and immortality. Penetrated with filch difpofitions, you have ground to come to the altar of God with humble trust and joy; under the belief, that you are approaching, through the great Redeemer, to that merciful Creator, to whom, in the bigb and boly place of eternity, the devout aspirations of his servants on earth, are ever acceptable and pleating.


# SERMON XVI. On the USE and ABUSE of the WORLD. 1 CORINTHIANS,  31. Â— They that use this world, as not abusing it. Â—


On the UsE and ABUSE of the WORLD.

I CORINTHIANS,  31.

-They that its this wgrld, as ntr abotfing it.THE world is always represented in 
Scripture as the great scene of trial to a Christian. It sets before him a variety of duties, which are incumbent on him to perform; and, at the fame time, surrounds him with many dangers, against which he has to guard. The part which is proper for him to aCt, may be comprised in these two expressive words of the text; uJing the world, and not albnTig it; the significancy and extent of which, I purpose now to explain. The subjed is of the higher imSBR  portance, as in the world we must live; 
and according as we uie, or abuse it, it will prove either our fi'icnd, or our greatclt foe.

It is natural to begin with observing, 
that the Chrillian is here supposed to ife the world; by which we must certainly underftand the Apoitle to mean, maintaining intercourfi .ld connection with the world; living in it, as one of the members of human ocicty; assuming that rank which belongs to his station. No one can be said to ufc' the world who lives not thus. Hence it follows, that sequestration from the world is no part of Chriltian duty; and it appears ftrangc, that even among those who approve not of monaftick confinement, feclufion from the pleafurcs of society should have been sometimes confidered, as bclonging to the character of a religious man.
They have been supposed to be the best fcrvants of God, who, consecrating their time to the exercifcs of (dvotion, mingle least in the ordinary commerce of the world; and cfpccially who abstain most rigidly rigidly from all that has the appearance of 
amusement. But how pious and sincere  soever the intentions of such persons may be, they certainly take not the propereft method, either for improving themselves, or for advancing religion among others. For this is not using the world, but relinquilhing it. Instead of making the light of a good example shine with useful splendour throughout the circle of society, they confine it within a narrow compass. According to the metaphor employed by our Saviour, after the candle is lighted, they put it under a bujhel. Instead of recommending religion to the world, they exhibit it under the forbidding aspect of unnecessary aufterity. Instead of employing their influence, to regulate and temper the pleasures of the world, by a moderate participation of those that are innocent, they deliver up all the entertainments of society, into the hands of the loose and giddy.

The various dangers which the world presents to one who is desirous of maintaining his piety and integrity, have given rife  rife to this scrupulous caution concerning xvI. the use of the world; and so far, the principle is commendable. But we must remember, that the virtue of a Christian is to be shown, in surmounting dangers which he is called to encounter. Into the post of danger we were ordered by Providence, when we were brought into this world.
We were placed as soldiers, on the field of battle. It is there, that our fidelity to our great Commander must appear. The most signal virtues which adorn and improve the human character, are displayed in a&ive life. There, the strength of the mind is brought forth, and put to the test. There, all the amiable dispositions of the heart find their proper exercise: humanity is cultivated; patience, fortitude, and felf-denial, come forward in all their forms; and the light of good men works so shines before others, as to lead them to glorify their Father wvhicb is in heaven.

It may be assumed, therefore, as a principle justified by the text, and by the whole strain of Scripture, that to use, and in a certain tain degree to enjoy, the world, is altoge- 
ther confifent with religion. According  to the rank which men possess in society, according to their age, their employment and connections, their intercourse with the world will be more or less extended. In private life, they use the world with propriety, who are ative and industrious in their callings; just and upright in their dealings; fober, contented, and chearful in their station. When the circumstances of men allow them a wider command of the enjoyments of the world, of those enjoyments they may freely partake, within the bounds of temperance, moderation, and decency. The highest situations of rank and opulence, ought to be distinguished by dignity of charader; by extensive beneficence, usefulness, and public spirit; by magnificence, without ostentation; and generous hospitality, without profuiion.

We shall have a clearer view of the proper use of the world, when we contrast it with that abuse of the world, which we too often oblerve. Those abuses manifest themselves in various forms; but in general may be classed under three great heads.

I. They are abusers of the world, who intemperately give themselves up to its pleafures, and lead a life of licentioufnefi, riot, and dissipation. Amidlt the wealth and luxury of the present age, it will be admitted, that persons of this description are not unfrequent, who, being opulent in fortune, and perhaps high in rank, think themselves intitled to pass their days in a careless manner, without any other objec in view, than the gratification of their senses and paflions. It shall be granted, that they are not obliged to that exat oeconomy and attention in their manner of living, which the state of fortune may require of others.
Gaiety shall be permitted to them; change of scene, and variety of amusements. But let them not forget, that as men and members of society, not to fay professors of the Christian faith, they are bound to flop (hort in their career of pleasure, as soon as it becomes disgraceful to themselves, and hurtful ful to the world. By the train of life which they lead, they defeat every purpose for which Providence beflowed on them the blessings of prolperitv. They fink every talent which they poilefs, into useless infignificancy. They corrupt the public manners by their example; and diiiule among others the spirit of extravagance and folly.
They behave in a manner altogether unsuitable to the condition of the world in which we live; where we are exposed to so much change, firrounded with so much distress, and daily behold ib many asseting scenes, as ought to awaken serious rellection, and chailen dirfolute mirth.

With indignant eves, the fober and tllinking part of mankind, view the luxury anl riot of those abulkrs of the world. To them are owing the discontents of the poor, their difaffecion to their fupcriors, their proneness to disturb the peace of the world.
When the poor behold wealth properly used, they look up with refped to them who poflefs it. They reft contented in their llation; and bless the just and the ge nerous, from whose munificence they reXV. ceive employment and reward. But when they behold those men of pleasure diffipating, in vice and folly, the fortune which their forefathers had honourably earned; when they behold them opprefling all their dependents, merely that they may revel in luxurious extravagance, then their hearts swell within them; with murmurs of fullen grief, they eye their Own mean habitation, and needy family; and become prepared for robbery, tumult, sedition, and every evil work.

The conduct of such abusers of the world, is not only pernicious to the welfare of society, and to the interests of virtue; it is equally ruinous to themselves.
I ihall not insist on the loss of reputation, the waste of fortune, the broken health, and debilitated frame, which are the wellknown consequences of a life of intemperate pleasure. I shall not recount all the better and more substantial enjoyments which they forfeit. Amidit the turbulence of riot, and the fumes of intoxication, unknown known to them are the rational entertain- 

XVL ments of regular life; the enjoyment of the _ face of nature; the pieafures of knowledge, and an improved mind; the pleafilres of private friendlhip, and domestic society; the conlcious litisfadion which accompanies honourable labours, and the jully acquired efleem of those who surround diem.
All theie they have thrown away; and in their room have substituted, what they think more high and vivid pleasures. But of what nature are those pleasures ? Even in liaghter the heart is frrowuyl; and the end of that mirth is heavinei +.

At the bottom of the hearts of all men, 
there lies a secret sense of propriety, virtue, and honour. This sense may be ob far blunted, as to lose its influence in guiding men to what is right, while yet it retains its power of making them feel that they are. acting wrong. Hence remorse often gnaws the heart, which affeas to appear light, and gay, before the world. Among the crowd of aVol. III. mufements,   mufements, the voluptuary may endea_  deavour to ltifle his uncafinels; but through all his defences it will penetrate. A confcious lense of his own insignificance, when he fees others diftinguilhed for atilng a manly and worthy part; reflection on the time he has wafted, and the contempt he has incurred; the galling remembrance of his earlier and better days, when he gave the fair promise of accomplilhmcnts, which now are blasted, have frequently been found to fadden the fcftive hour. The noie' of merriment may be heard; but hcavincfs lies at the heart. While the tabret and the viol play, a melancholy voice founds in his ears. The wafted estate, the neglected halls, and ruined mansion of his fathers, rife to view. The angry countenances of his friends, seem to flare him in the fice. A hand appears to come forth on the wall, and to write his doom.

Retreat then, from your dishonourable courses, ye who by licentioufnefl, extravagance, and vice, are abusers of the world!
you are degrading, you are ruining yourselves. You are grossly miremploving the gifts of God; and the giver will not fail to XVI punilh. Awake to the pursuits of men of virtue, and honour. Break loose from that magic circle, within which you are at present held. Reje& the poisoned cup which the enchantress Pleasure holds up to your lips. Draw aside the veil which ihe throws over your eyes. You will then fee other objets than you now behold. You will fee a dark abyss opening below your feet.
You will fee virtue and temperance marking out the road, which conducts to true felicity. You will be enabled to discern, that the world is enjoyed to advantage, by none but such as follow those divine guides; and who confider pleasure as the seasoning, but not as the business of life.
  THE world is abused, not only by an intemperate pursuit of its pleasures, but by a fordid attachment to its gains. This respeds a set of men of very different description from the former; more decent in their carriage, and less flagrant in their . 2 vices; 
BERM. vices; but corrupted by the world in no xvL less a degree. For the world is often abused by the men of butinefs, as much as by the men of pleasure. When worldly success becomes the sole object of their life; when the accumulation of fortune so engrolfes them, as to harden their heart against every feeling of moral obligation; when it renders them insensible to the calls of asfecion, and to the impressions ox piety and religion; they then come under the class of the covetous, whom, it is said, the Lord abborretb *.

The world, with its advantages, is a lawful object of pursuit to a Christian.
He may seek, by fair industry, to render his circumitances affluent. Without reproof, he may aim at distinction and consideration in the world. He may beRtow a considerable portion of his time and attention, on the successful management of his worldly interests. All this is within the limits of that allowable use of the world, to which religion gives its sanction. But to Psalm  3.

a a wife and good man, the world is only a .


secondary object. He remembers there is  an eternity beyond it. His care is, not merely to amass and possess, but to use his poffeiffons well, as one who is accountable to God. He is not a save, either to the hopes, or the fears of the world. He would rather forfeit any present advantage, than obtain it at the expencc of violating the divine  or neglecting his duty. This is using the world like a good man. This is living in it, as a subjed of God, and a member of the great community of mankind. To such a man, riches are a blefsing. He may enjoy them with magnificence; but he will use them with liberality. They open a wide field to the exercif:
of his virtuc, and allow it to shine with diffilfive lufire.

Very opposite to this, is the character of the worldly-minded. To them, the mere attainment of earthly poffefions, is an ultimate aim. They cannot be said to tfe the world; for to posess,, not to use or enjoy, is their object. They are emphatically said 3 in  il Scripture, to /lad enflvc wilb thick   `'. Some fort of apology imav hb framed for them who seek to extract from the world, pleafurc of one kind or other. But for thole who know no ple:afurc, farther than adding boise to bore, and field to field, and calling them their own, it is hardly possible to frame any apology. Such persons are idolaters of the worst kind; for they have made the world their God. They daily worship and bow down before it; and hold nothing to be mean or base, which can promote the enlargement of their fortune.- He is an abuser of the world, let his possession of it be ever so ample, who knows nothing higher than the gains of the world. He is an abuser of the world, who sacrifices probity, virtue, or humanity, to its interests. He is an abuser of the world, who cannot occasionally retreat from it, to confider what character he bears in the fight of God; and to what iftue his conduclt will bring him at last. In a word, the Hlabakkuk,  6.

world world is then properly used, when it is ge- ;. RM.
ncrouily and beneficently enjoyed; neither hoarded up by) avarice, nor Ilulandcred( by ostentation.

111. TmFE world is abuscd, thoc who employ its advantages to the injury or ojpreflion of their brcthren. Under this class are included, the worst and most criminal abufcrs of the world; who turn a^ainft their fellow - crcatures, those advantages with which it has pleased Heaven to diflinguilh them. It is a class which comprehends, the sovereign who tyrannises over his people; the great man who oppreffcs his dependents; the master who is cruel to his servants; every one, in fine, who renders his superiority of any kind, whether of wealth or power, unnecessarily grievous to those who are his inferiors: Whose supercilioufnefs dejeas the modest; whose infolence tramples on the poor; whose rigour makes the widow and the orphan weep.

Within these limits, we may safely enjoy all the comforts which the world affords, and our station allows. But if we pass beyond these boundaries, into the regions of disorderly and vicious pleasure, of debasing covetousness, or of oppressive insolence, the world will then serve only to corrupt our minds, and to accelerate our ruin. The licentious, the avaricious, and the insolent, form the three great classes of abusers of the world.

Let not thote who are in wealthy and flourifling circumstances, complain of the restraints which religious doctrine attempts to impose on their enjoyments. For, to what do there refiraints amount ? To no more than this, that, by their pleasures, they would neither injure themselves, nor injure others. We call not on the young, to relinquifli their gaiety; nor on the rich, 
to to forego their opulence; nor on the great, to lay alide their slate. We only call on them, not to convert gaiety into licentiousness; not to employ opulence in mere extravagance; nor to abuse greatness for the oppression of their inferiors: While they enjoy the world, not to forget that they are the fubjeds of God, and are loon to pass into another state. Let the motive by which the Apostle enforces the exhortation in the text, present itself to their thought; Lie this world as not abusing it; for the faJhion of the world paetbh away. Its pomp and its pleasures, its riches, magnificence, and glory, are no more than a transient show. Every thing that we here enjoy, changes, decays, and comes to an end. All floats on the surface of a river, which, with swift current, is running towards a boundless ocean. Beyond this present scene of things, above these sublunary regions, we are to look for what is permanent and stable. The world pafles away; but God, and heaven, and virtue, continue unchangeably the fame. We ate soon to enter into eternal  eternal habitations: and into these, oui _Vl works {hall follow us.

On EXTREMES in RELIGIOUS and MORAL CONDUCT.

PROVERBS,  27.
Turn not to the right band, nor to the left. Will behave mfff wisej , said the Pfallnit 
David, in a perfrc way . Wildom is 

no less necessary in religious, and moral, than in civil conduct. Unless there be a proper degree of light in the understanding, it will not be enough, that there are good dispositions in the heart. Without regular guidance, they will often err fiom the right scope. They will be always wavering  vering and unfleady; nay, on some occaxvnl sions, they may betray us into evil. This is too much verified by that propensity to run into extremes, which so often appears in the behaviour of men. How many have originally set out with good principles, and intentions, who, through want of difcretion in the application of their principles, have in the end injured themselves, and brought discredit on religion ? There is a certain temperate mean, in the observance of which, piety and virtue consist. On each there lies a dangerous extreme.
Bewildering paths open; by deviating into which, men are apt to forfeit all the praise of their good intentions; and to finifl with reproach, what they had begun with honour. This is the ground of the wife man exhortation in the text. Iet thine eyes look right on, and let thine eye-lids look flraight before thee. .Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be eftablified. Turn not to the right hand, nor to the left; remove tbyfootfrom evil. In discoursing from these words, I purpose to point out some of the extremes extremes into which men are apt to run in religion and morals; and to suggest dircc- _XVI tions for guarding against them.

WITH regard to religious principle in general, it may perhaps be expeced, that I should warn you of the danger of being, on one hand, too rigid in adhering to it, and, on the other hand, too easy in relaxing it. But the diftindion between these supposed extremes, I conceive to have no foundation. No man can be too ftrid, in his adherence to a principle of duty. Here, there is no extreme. All relaxation of principle, is criminal. What conscience ditates is to be ever obeyed. Its commands are universally sacred. Even though it should be misled, yet, as long as we conceive it to utter the voice of God, in disobeying it we fin. The error, therefore, to be here avoided is, not too scrupulous or tender regard to conscience, but too little care to have conscience properly enlightened, with refpet to what is matter of duty and of fin. - Recive not, without examination,   III. A a whatever  whatever human tradition has consecrated XVII.

, as sacred. Recur, on every occasion, to those great fountains of light and knowledge, which are opened to you in the pure word of God. Diftinguiih, with care, between the superstitious fancies of men, and the everlasting commandments of God.
Exhaust not on trifles that zeal, which ought to be reserved for the weightier matters of the law. Overload not confcicnce, with what is frivolous and unnecessary.
But when you have once drawn the line, with intelligence and precision, between dnty and fin, that line you ought on no occasion to transgress.

THOUGH there is no extreme in the reverence due to conscience, there may undoubtedly be an extreme, in laying too much stress, either on mere principle, or on mere practice. Here we must take particular care, not to turn to the right band, nor to the left; but to bold faith and a good csfrience united, as the Scripture, with great propriety, 
propriety, exhorts ns *. The error of reft- FR 


 wholly on faith, or wholly on works,  i is one of those fedudions, which most eafily mislead men; under the semblance of piety on the one hand, and of virtue on the other. This is not an error peculiar to our times. It has obtained in every age of the Christian church. It has run through all the different modes of false religion. It forms the chief diftinftion of all the various fedts which have divided, and which ltill continue to divide the church; according as they have leaned most to the of belief, or to the of morality.

Did we liften candidly to the voice of Scripture,it would guard us against either extreme.
The Apostle Paul every where testifies, that by no works of our own we can be juftifled; and that vitxhut faith it is impofible to please God. The Apostle James as clearly shows, that faith, if it be unproductive of good works, justifies no man. Between thole sentiments, there is no opposition.

' Tirothy, i. 19.

A a 2 Faith  Faith without works, is nugatory and inxvH_, significant. It is a foundation, without any fuperftrucdre raised upon it. It is a fountain which fends forth no stream; a tree which neither bears fruit, nor affords (hade.
Good works, again, without good principles, are a fair, but airy ftrudure; without firmness or stability. They resemble the house built on the sand; the reed which shakes with every wind. You must join the two in full union, if you would exhibit the character of a real Christian. He who sets faith in opposition to morals, or morals in opposition to faith, is equally an enemy to the interests of religion. He holds up to view an imperfect and disfigured form; in the room of what ought to command refpet from all beholders. By leaning to one extreme, he is in danger of falling into vice; by the other, of running into impiety.

WHATEVER the belief of men be, they generally pride themselves, in the possession of obme good moral qualities. The sense of of duty is deeply rooted in the human 


heart. Without some pretence to virtue, _ there is no felf-efleem; and no man wishes to appear in his own view, as entirely worthless. But as there is a constant strife between the lower and higher parts of our nature, between inclination and principle, this produces much contradition and inconsistency in conduc. Hence arise most of the extremes, into which men run in their moral behaviour; refting their whole worth on that good quality, to which, by constitution or temper, they are most inclined.

ONE of the firfi and most common of those extremes, is that of placing all virtue, either in justice, on the one hand; or in generosity, on the other. The opposition between these, is most discernible among two different classes of men in focicty.
They who have earned their fortune by a laborious and industrious life, are naturally tenacious of what they have painfully acquired. To justice, they confider themA a selves  eflves as obliged; but to go beyond it ia  , aCcas of kindness, they confider as superfluous and extravagant. They will not take any advantage of others, which conscience tells them is iniquitous; but neither will they make any allowance for their neccffities and wants. They contend, with rigorous exadnefs, for what is due to themselves. They are satisfied, if no man susser unjustly by them. That no one is benefited by them, gives them little concern.
- Another set of men place their whole merit in generosity and mercy; while to justice and integrity they pay small regard.
These are persons generally of higher rank, and of easy fortune. To them, juffice appears a fort of vulgar virtue, requisite chiefly in the petty tranfadtions, which those of inferior fation carry on with one another.
But humanity and liberality, they confider as more refined virtues, which dignify their characer, and cover all their failings. They can relent at reprcfentations of distress; can bellow with ostentatious generosity; can even occaionally {hare their wealth with a companion companion of whom they are fond; while, SERK at the fame time, they with-hold from XVII others what is due to them; are negligent of their family and their relations; and to the just demands of their creditors give no attention.

Both these classes of men run to a faulty extreme. They aivide moral virtue between them. Each takes that part of it only, which suits his temper. Without juffice, there is no virtue. But without humanity and mercy, no virtuous charaCter is complete. The one man leans to the extreme of parsimony. The other, to that of profusion. The temper of the one is unfeeling. The sensibility of the other is thoughtless. The one you may in some degree refpea; but you cannot love. The other may be loved; but cannot be refpeated: and it is difficult to   which characer is most defetive.-We must undoubtedly begin with being jurt, before we attempt to be generous. At the fame time, he who goes no farther than bare justice, flops at the beginning of virtue. We are A a 4 ; omn  commanded to do jutly; but, to love mercy.

-~, The one virtue, regulates our actions. The other, improves our heart and affecions.
Each is equally necessary to the happiness of the world. Justice is the pillar, that upholds the whole fabric of human focietv.
Mercy is the genial ray, which chears and warms the habitations of men. The perfedion of our social characterconfifts, in properly tempering the two with one another; in holding that middle course, which admits of our being just, without being rigid; and allows us to be generous, without being unjust.

WE muff next guard against either too great severity, or too great facility of manners. These are extremes, of which we every day behold instances in the world.
He who leans to the of severity, is harfl in his censures, and narrow in his opinions. He cannot condescend to others in things indifferent. He has no allowance to make for human frailty; or for the difference of age, rank, or temper, among mankind.

mankind. With him, all gaiety is sinful 


levity; and every amusement is a crime. '-;vTo this extreme, the admonition of Solomon may be understood to belong; Be not righteous over much; neither make tbyelf over wis. Why /houldft thou dtflroy thyself *
When this severity of manners is hypocritical, and assumed as a cloak to secret indulgence, it is one of the worst proftitutions of religion. But I now confider it, not as the effec of design, but of natural austerity of temper, and of contrated maxims of conduct. Its influence upon the person himself, is to render him gloomy and four; upon others, to alienate them both from his society, and his counsels; upon religion, to set it forth as a morose and forbidding principle.-The opposite extreme to'this is, perhaps, still more dangerous; that of too great facility, and accommodation to the ways of others. The man of this character, partly from indolent weakness, and partly from softness of tem*Ecccf.  16.


r8El per, is disposed to a tame and universal as. I, sent. Averse either to contradic or to blance, he goes along with the manners that prevail. He views every character with indulgent eye; and with good dispositions in his breat, and a natural relutance to profligacy and vice, he is enticed to the conmillion of evils which he condemns, merely through want of fortitude to oppose others.

Nothing, it must be confessed. in moral conduct, is more difficult, than to avoid turning here, either to the right band or to the left. One of the grtateft trials both of wisdom and virtue is, to preserve a just medium, between that harshness of aufterity, which disgusts and alienates mankind, and that weakness of good-nature, which opens the door to sinful excefi. The one separates us too much from the world. The other connects us too cloely with it; and reduces us to follow the multitude in doing evil. One who is of the former character, studies too little to be agreeable, in order to render himself useful. He who is of the latter, 
latter, by studying too much to be agree- stitU able, forfeits his innocence. If the one a_ hurt religion, by cloathing it in the garb of unnecessary ftridnefs; the other, by unwarrantable compliance, strengthens the power of corruption in the world. The one borders on the character of the Phirifee; the other, on that of the Sadducee.
True religion enjoins us to stand at an equal distance from both; and to pursue the difficult, but honourable aim, of uniting good nature with fixed religious principle; affable manners, with untainted virtue.

FARTHER ; we run to one extreme, when we contemn altogether the opinions of man.
kind; to another, when we court their praise too eagerly. The former discovers a high degree of pride and felf-conceit.
The latter betrays servility of spirit. We are formed by nature and Providence, to be connected with one another. No man can stand entirely alone, and independent of all his fellow-creaturcs. A reasonable re.


gE  gard, therefore, for their esteem and good -,, opinion, is a commendable principle. It flows from humanity; and coincides with the desire of being mutually useful. But, if that regard be carried too tar, it becomes the-fource of much corruption. For in the present slate of mankind, the praise of the world often interferes with our acting that steady and conscientious part, which gains the approbation of God. Hence arises the difficulty of drawing a proper line, between the allowable regard for reputation, and the exceflive dcfire of praise. On the one  and on the other, dangers meet us; and either extreme will be pernicious to virtue.
 who extinguishes all regard to the frntiments of mankind, suppresses one incentive to honourable deeds; nay, he removes one of the lIrongefi checks on vice.
For, where there is no desire of praifc, there will be also no sense of reproach and si ame; and when this sense is destroyed, the way is paved to open profligacy. On the other hand, he who is acuated solely by the love of human praise, incroaches on the the higher refpe& which he owes to SERX XVIL science, and to God. Hence, virtue ist often counterfeited; and many a fplendid appearance has been exhibited to the world, which had no basis in real prin.
ciple, or inward affection. Hence, religious truths have been disguised, or unfairly represented, in order to be suited to popular taste. Hence the Scribes and Pharilees rejeted our blessed Lord, becanfi they loved the prafi of men more than the praise of God.-Turn, therefore, neither to the right hand, nor to the left. Assed not to despise what the world thinks of your condud and characer; and yet, let not the sentiments of the world entirely rule you.
Let a desire of esteem be one motive of your condut; but let it hold a fubordinate place. Measure the regard that is due to the opinions of men, by the degree in which these coincide with the law of God.

ALLOW me next to suggest, the danger of running to the extreme of anxiety about worldly interests on the one hand, and of negligence SERAM. negligence on the other. It is hard to sty _,_, which of these extremes is fraught with mot vice, and most misery. Industry and diligence are unquestionable duties, ftrici ly enforced on all Chriltians; and he who fails in making suitable provision for his household and family, is pronounced to be rorfe than an infidel. But there are bounds, within which our concern for worldly fuccess mufl be confined. For anxiety is the certain poison of human life. It debases the mind; and iharpens all the paflions.
It involves men in perpetual diftraCfions, and tormenting cares; and leads them aside from what ought to be the great scope of human afion. Anxiety is, in general, the effeA of a covetous temper. Negligence is commonly, the offspring of licentiousness, and always, the parent of universal difor.
der. By anxiety, you render yourselves miserable. By negligence, you too often occasion the ruin of others. The anxious man is the votary of riches; the negligent man, the votary of pleasure. Each offers his mistaken worihip, at the llrine of a false false deity; and each ihall reap only such rewards as an idol can bellow; the one fa.
crificing the enjoyment and improvement of the present, to vain cares about futurity; the other so totally taken up in enjoying the present, as to ore the future with certain miseries. -True virtue holds a temperate course between these extremes; neither careless of to-morrow, nor taking too much thought for it; diligent, but not anxious; prudent, but not covetous; attentive to provide comfortable accommodation on earth, but chiefly concerned to lay up treafitrec in Heaven.

I {hall only warn you farther against the extreme, of engaging in a courle ot hte too busy and hurned, or of devoting yourselves to one too retired and unemployed.
We are formed for a mixture ot acton, and retreat. Our connections with society, and the performance of the duties which we owe to one another, necessarily engage us in active life. What we owe to ourselves, requires occasional retirement For he wlho lives GERM. lives always in the buffle of the world canxvsl. not, it is to be feared, always prcferve his virtue pure. Sentiments of piety will be deprived of that nourilhment and support, which they would derive from meditation and devotion. His temper will be often ruffled and disturbed. His passions will be kept too much on the stretch. From the contagious manners which every where abound, he will not be able to avoid contracqing some dangerous infection.- On the other hand, he who flies to total retreat, in order either to enjoy ease, or to escape from the temptations of the world, will often find disquiet meeting him in solitude, and the worst temptations arising from within himself. Unoccupied by acive and honourable pursuits, unable to devote his whole time to improving thoughts, many an evil pafilon will start up, and occupy the vacant hour. Sullenness and gloom will be in danger of overwhelming him. Peevish displeasure, and suspicions of mankind, are apt to persecute those who withdraw themselves altogether from the haunts of men.

-Steer Steer therefore a middle course, SEB .

tween a life oppressed with bufnefs on the one hand; and burdened, for the burden is no less, with idleness on the other. Provide for yourselves matter of fair and honest pursuit, to afford a proper obje& to the aAtive powers of the mind. Temper business with serious meditation; and enliven retreat by returns of action and induftry.

THUS I have pointed out some of those extremes into which men are apt to run, by forsaking the line which religion and wisdom have drawn. Many more, I am sensible, might be suggested; for the field is wide, and hardly is there any appearance of piety, virtue, or good conduct, but what the folly of men is apt to push into undue excels, on one or other  What I have mentioned, will be sufficient to ihow the necessity of prudent circumfpeieon, in order to escape the dangers which beset us in this state of trial.

Thus, turning neither to the right band nor to the left, we Ihall, as far as our frailty permits, approach to the perfecion of the human character; and ihall have reason not to be ajbamed when we have equal refpcct to all God commandments.


# SERMON XVIII. On SCOFFING at RELIGION. 2 Peter, iii. 3. Â— There shall come in the last days Scoffers. Â—




On SCOPPING at RELIGION.

2 Peter, iii. 3.

 herejball come i the lajI days Soffcrs.-A the Christian religion is adverse to the 

inchnauons and paihons ot the corrupt- xvIII.
 part ot manund, it has been its tate, every age, to encounter the oppolition of various foes. Sometimes, it has undergone the storms of violence and persecution. Sometimes, it has been attacked by the arms of false reasoning, and sophistry. When these have failed of success, it has at other times been exposed to the scoffs of the petulant. Men of light and frivolous minds, who had no comprehtainio of thought for discerning , b 2 'hat EZ . what is great, and no solidity of judgeXVIII. ment for deciding on what is true, have taken upon them to treat religion with contempt, as if it were of no consequence to the world. They have asseted to represent the whole of that venerable fabric, which has so long commanded the refpet of mankind; which, for ages, the learned have supported, and the wife have admired, as having no better foundation than the gloomy imagination of fanatics and vifionaries. Of this charaer were those fcofsers, predicted by the Apostle to arise ix the lta days a predicion which we have seen too often fulfilled As the falie colours which such men throw on religion, are apt to impose on the wek and unwary, let us now examine, whether religion affords any jift grounds for the contempt or ridicule of the scoffer. They must be either the dotrines, or the precepts of religion, which he endeavours to hold forth to contempt.

Tab doctrines of the Chriflian religion are ratiorn pure. All tht it has revealed wealed concerning the perfetlions of God, s3 It his moral government and laws, the deftination of man, and the rewards and punithments of a future state, is perfettly con, sonant to the most enlightened reason. In some articles which transcend the limits of our present faculties, as in what relates to the eflence of the Godhead, the fallen state of mankind, and their redemption by Jesus Christ, its do&trines may appear mysterious and dark. Against these, the scoffer has often directed his attacks; as if whatever could not be explained by us, ought upon that account to be exploded as absurd.

It is unnecessary to enter,at prefent,on any particular defence of these ditrines, as there is one observation which, if duly weighed, is fuffident to silence the cavils of the rcofser. Is he not compelled to admit, that the whole system of nature around him is full of myfery? What reason, then, had he to suppose, that the do&rines of revelation, proceeding from the fame author, were to contain no myfterios obscurity ? All that is requifie for the condu& of life, both b 3 nature . nature and in religion, divine wisdom has _XVI_. rendered obvious to all. As nature has asforded us fuilicient information concerning what is necetfary for our tood, our accommodation, and our safety; so religion has plainly inltructcd us in our duty towards God, and our neighbour. But as lion as we attempt to rile towards objects that lie beyond our immediate sphere of aCtion, our curiolity is checked; and darkness meets us on every  What the essence is of those material bodies which we fee and handle; how a feed grows up into a tree; how man is formed in the womb; or how the mind ads upon the body, after it is formed; are mysteries of which we can give no more account, than of the most obscure and difficult parts of revelation. We are obliged to admit the existence of the fad, though the explanation of it exceeds our faculties.

After the fame manner, in natural religion, questions arise concerning the creation of the world from nothing, the origin of evil under the government of a per,  Being, 
Being, and the consistency of human liber- 
ty with divine prescience, which are of as xi intricate nature, and of as difficult solution, as any queftlons in Christian theology. We may plainly fee, that we are not admitted into the secrets of Providence, any more than into the mysteries of the Godhead. In all his ways, the Almighty is a God that bidetb himsef He makctb darkness hit pavilion. He boldeth back thee face of bi throne; and fpreadeth a thick cloud upon it.-InRead of its being any objection to revelation, that some of its dotrines are myfterious, it would be much more ifrange and unaccountable, if no such dodrines were found in it. Had every thing in the Chriftian system been perfectly level to our capacities, this might rather have given ground to a suspicion, of its not proceeding from God; since it would have been then so unlike to what we find, both in the system of the universe, and in the system of natural religion. Whereas, according as matters now stand, the gospel has the fame seatures, the fame general characer, with the b 4 other SERtB. other two, which are acknowledged to be of ~^ divine origin; plain and comprchenfible, in what relates to pracice; dark and myfterious, in what relates to speculation and belief *. The cavils of the scoffer, therefore, on this head, are so far from having any jus foundation, that they only discover his ignorance, and the narrowness of his views.

LET us next proceed to what relates to prafice, or the preceptive part of religion.
-The duties which religion enjoins us to perform towards God, are those which have ofteneft furnished matter to the fcoft of the licentious. They attempt to represent thef: as so idle and superfluous, that they could owe their birth to nothing but en.
thufidia.-For, is not the Deity so far exalhd above us, as to receive neither advantage nor pleasure, from our worship ? What are our prayers,or our praifes,to that infinite Sec this argument fully pursued, and placed in a sfg light, by tim mdekry hand of BiRop Butler, in hi; dots/ A A 4RAw4a R4 0iw.


mind, who, refting in the full enjoyment SErtM of his own beatitude, beholds all his crea- xvIt.
tures palling before him, only as the infects of a day ? What but superstitious terrors, could have dictated those forms of homage, and those diftintions of sacred days, in which vulgar minds delight, but which the liberal and enlarged look upon with scorn?

Now, in return to such insults of the scoffer, it might be sufficient to observe, that the united sentiments of mankind, in every age and nation, are against him.
Thoughtless as the bulk of men are, and attached only to objects which they fee around them; this principle has never been extinguished in their breasts, that to the great Parent of the human race, the universal, though invisible, benefactor of the world, not only internal reverence, but external homage is due. Whether he need that homage or not, is not the queRfion. It is what, on our part, we undoubtedly owe; and the heart is, with reason, held to be bate, which tfifles the emotions of gratitude to a benefaaor, how independent soever SE tR ever he may be of any returns. True virXVIII. XVI__ tue, always prompts a public declaration of the grateful sentiments which it feels; and glories in exprefling them. Accordingly, over all the earth, crowds of worshippers have aflembled to adore, in various forins, the Ruler of the world. In these adorations, the philosopher, the savage, and the faints have equally joined. None but the cold and unfeeling can look up to that beneficent Being, who is at the head of the universe, without some inclination to pray, or to praise. In vain, therefore, would the scoffer deride, what the loud voice of nature demands andjuftifies. He ere himself againit the general, and declared sense of the human race.

But apart from this consideration, I must call on him to attend to one of a still more serious and awful nature. By his licentious ridicule of the duties of piety, and of the institutions of divine worship, he is weakening the power of conscience over men; he is undermining the great pillars of socicty; he is giving a mortal blow to public order, 
order, and public happineis. All there reft on nothing so much, as on the general xvL.
lief of an all-feeing witness, and the general veneration of an Almighty Governor, On this belief, and this veneration, is found. the whole obligation of an oath; without which, government could not be adminiftered, nor courts of justice at; contro.
verfies could not be determined, nor private property be preserved safe. Our only fecurity againit innumerable crimes, to which the refiraints of human laws cannot reach, is the dread of an invisible avenger, and of those future punishments which he hath prepared for the guilty. Remove this dread from the minds of men; and you firengthen the hands of the wicked, and endanger the safety of human society.

But how could impressions so neceflary to the public welfare be preierved, if there were no religious assemblies, no sacred inftitutions, no days set apart for divine worihip, in order to be solemn remembrancers to men of the existence, and the dominion of God; and of the future account they have to Ste to give of their actions to him ? To all rtnke xvxIL of men, the fentimente which public religion tends to awaken, are salutary and beneficial. But with refpet to the inferior classes, it ie well known, that the only principles which restrain them from evil, are acquired in the religious assemblies which they frequent. Destitute of the advantages of regular education; ignorant, in great measure, of public laws; unacquainted with those refined ideas of honour and propriety, to which other of more knowledge have been trained; were those sacred temples deserted to which they now resort, they would be in danger of degenerating into a ferocious race, from whom lawlefi violence was perpetually to be dreaded.

He, therefore, who treats sacred things with any degree of levity and scorn, is ading the part, perhaps without his feeing or Inowing it, of a public enemy to society.
He is preeifely the madma described in the book of Proverbs, * who caqthb frramnr, 
* Pror. uri. if&


arrow:, and death; and faith, am I not in SElIt fpert? We ihall hear him, at times, vl_ plain loudly of the undutifulness of children, of the dishonesty of servants, of the tumults and insolence of the lower ranks; while he himself is, in a great measure, rtfponfible for the disorders of which he complains. By the example which he sets of contempt for religion, he becomes accefiry to the manifold crimes, which tat contempt occasions among others. By his feoffing at sacred institutions, he is encouraging the rabble to uproar and violence; he is emboldening the false witness to take the name of God in vain; he is, in cffet, putting arms into the hands of the highwayman, and letting loose the robber on the streets by night.

WE came next to confider that great class of duties, which refpet our conduA towards our fellow-creaturs. The obfolute nece~iy of thefc to general welfare is so apparent, as to have secured them, in a reat degree, from the attacks of the fcofSItM. ser. He who mhould attempt to turn jumi fice, truth, or honesty, into ridicule, would be avoided by every one. To those who had any remains of principle, he would be odious. To thoie who attended only to their interest, he would appear a dangerous man. But though the fbcial virtues are treated in general as refpedable and lared, there are certain forms and degrees of them, which have not been exempted from the scorn of the unthinking. That extensive generosity, and high public spirit, which prompt a man to iacrifice his own interelt, in order to promote some great general good; and that ftrid and scrupulous integrity, which will not allow one, on any occasion, to depart from the truth; have often been treated with contempt by those who are called men of the world. They wh ,will not sloop to flatter the great; who diidain to comply with prevailing manners, when 4heyijudge them t9 be evil; who refuli to take the fiuallll adva.gepf.others, in order tq.procure the. glreief:benefit.for ttemuelvea; are repref~ert ;as.pearn ,of romantic romantic characer, and visionary notions,  unacquainted with the world, and unfit XVIII."
"Such persons are so far from being liable to any just ridicule, that they are intitled to a degree of refpet, which approaches to veneration. For they are, in truth, the great supporters and guardians of public order. The authority of their characer overawes the giddy multitude. The weight of their example retards the progress of corruption; checks that relaxation of morals, which is always too apt to gain ground insensibly, and to make incroachments on every department of society. Accordingly, it is this high generosity of spirit, this inflexible virtue, this regard to principle, fuperior to all opinion, which has ever marked the characters of those who have eminently distinguished themselves in public life; who have patronised the cause of juslice against powerful oppressors; who, in critical times, have supported the falling rights and liberties of men; and have refleded honour on their nation and country."
"Such ER Such persons may have been scoffed at by  . fIome among whom they lived; but pofterity has done them ample justice; and they are the persons, whose names are recorded to future ages, and who are thought and spoken of with admiration."
"The mere temporizer, the man of accommodating principles, and inferior virtue, may support a plausible character for a while among his friends and followers; but as soon as the hollowness of his principles is detected, he finks into contempt."
"They who are prone to deride men of inflexible integrity, only betray the littlenef of their minds. They ihow that they underftand not the sublime of virtue; that thev have no discernment of the true excellence of man, By asseting to throw any discouragement on purity and strisnels of morals, they not only expose themselves to just contempt, but propagate fentiments very dangerous to society. For, if we loosen the regard due to virtue in any cf its parts, we begin to sap the whole of it. No man, as it has been often said, becomes comes entirely profligate at once. He deo viates, ftep by ftep, from conscience. If i_."
"the loose caluiftry of the scoffer were to prevail, open difhonelty, falsehood, and treachery, would speedily grow out of thoft complying principles, those relaxations of virtue, which he would reprelent to be neceflary for every man who knows the world."
"THs lift class of virtues I am to men."
"tion, are those which are of a personal nature, and which refped the government to be exercised over our pleasures and passions."
"Here, the scoffer has always confidered himself as having an ample field. Often, and often, have such virtues as fobriet, temperance, modesty, and chastity, been made the subject of ridicule, as monkish habits, which exclude men from the company of the faihionable and the gay; ha."
"bits, which are the cffcd of low education, or of mean spirits, or of mere feebleness of constitUtion; while (coflrs, walking, as it is too truly said of then by the Apoltle, after  Ill. c /I,.;:"
"SERM their luJft, boast of their own manners as XVII. liberal and free, as manly and spirited."
"They fancy themselves raised thereby much above the crowd; and hold all those in contempt, who confine themselves within the vulgar bounds of regular and orderly life."
"Infatuated men! who fee not that the virtues of which they make sport, not only derive their authority from the laws of God, but are moreover essentially requisite both to public, and to private happiness."
"By the indulgence of their licentious pleafures for a.while, as long as youth and vigour remain, a few pairing gratifications may be obtained. But what are the confequences ? Suppose any individual to persevere unrestrained in this course, it is certainly to be followed by disrepute in his charader, and disorder in his affairs; by a wafted and broken conflitution; and a speedy and miserable old age. Suppose a society to be wholly formed of such persons as the scoffers applaud; suppose it to be filled with none but those whom they call the sons of pleasure; that is, with the intemperate, the riotous, and diflilute, among "
"whom all regard to lobriety, decency, and xvIII."
"private virtue, was aboli:hd,; what an odious fceine would such a iociety exhibit ? How unluie any civilised or well-ordered state, in wiich mankind have chosen to dwell What turbulence and uproar, what contests and quarrels, would perpetually reign in it ? What man of common underltanding would not rather chufe to dwell in a "
"fert, than to be alrociated for life with such companions ? Shall, then, the scoffer prefume to make light of those virtues, without which there could be neither peace, nor comfort, nor good order, among mankind ?"
"Let him be desired to think, of his do."
"meltic situation and connections. Is he a father, a husband, or a brother ? Has he any friend or relation, male or female, in whose happiness he is intereited ?- Let us put the question to him, whether he be willing that intemperance, unchastity, or dilfipation of any kind, flould mark their charafter ? Would he recommend to them c 2 such  such excesses ? Would he chufe, in their tI_ ,presence, openly, and without disguise, to scoff at the opposite virtues, as of no consequence to their welfare ?- If even the most licentious lmudders at the thought; if, in the midst of his loo pleafuires, he be desirous that his own family lhould remain untainted; let this teach him the valuc of those private virtues, which, in the hours of dissipation, in the giddiness of his mind, he is ready to contemn. Baniih sobriety, temperance, and purity, and you tear up the foundations of all public order, and all domestic quiet. You render every house a divided and miserable abode, refounding with terms of ihame, and mutual reproaches of infamy. You leave nothing refpecable in the human charader. You change the man into a brute."
"THE conclusion from all the reasonings which we have now pursued is, that religion and virtue, in all their forms, either of doctrine or of precept; of piety towards God, integrity towards men, or regularity in in private conduct; are so far from afford- ER any grounds of ridicule to the petulant,  that they are intitled to our highest veneration; they are names, which should never be mentioned, but with the utmost honour. It is said in Scripture, Fools make a mock at fin *. They had better make a mock at pestilence, at war, or famine."
"With one, who should chufe these public calamities for the fubjedt of his sport, you would not be inclined to associate. You would fly from him, as worse than a fool; as a man of distempered mind, from whom you might be in hazard of receiving a fudden blow. Yet certain it is, that, to the great fbciety of mankind, fin is a greater calamity, than either pestilence, or famine, or war. These operate, only as occasional causes of misery. But the fins and vices of men, are perpetual scourges of the world, Impiety and injustice, fraud and falsehood, intemperance and profligacy, are daily producing mischief and disorder; bringing * rov. xiv. 9."
"C ruin GERM ruin on individuals; tearing families and XVIII."
"communities in pieces; giving rife to a thousand tragical kcenes on this unhappy theatre. In proportion as manners are vicious, mankind are unhappy, The perfedion of virtue which reigns in the world above, is the chief source of the perfeca blessedness which prevails there."
"When, therefore, we observe any tendency to treat religion or morals with difresped and levity, let us hold it to be a sure indication of a perverted understanding, or a depraved heart. In the feat of the scorner let us never fit. Let us account that wit contaminated, which attempts to sport itself on sacred fubjces. When the scoffer arifis, let us rraintain the honour of our God, and our Redeemer; and resolutely adhere to the cause of virtue and goodness. The rlps of the uwif utter knowledge; but the mouth of the foolfh iJ near to delruilion. Him that bonoureth God, God will honour. Thefear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom : and be that keepeth the commandment, keepctt his tWnI foul."
"# SERMON XIX. On the CREATION of the WORLD. GENESIS, i. 1. In the beginning God created the heaven, and the earth."
"On the CREATION of the WORLD."
"In the beginning God created the heaven, and the earth."
"SUCH is the commencement of the his- "
"tory of mankind; an aera, to which we __ must ever look back with solemn awe and veneration. Before the fun and the moon had begun their course; before the found of the human voice was heard, or the name of man was known; in the beginning God created the heaven, and the earth.To a beginning of the world, we are led back by every thing that now exists; by all history, all records, all monuments of c 4 antiquity."
"SFR  antiquity. In tracing the tranfadions of XLX."
"_LLf, pafl ages, we arrive at a period, which clearly indicates the infancy of the human race."
"W behold the world peopled by degrees."
"We ascend to the origin of all those useful and necefiary arts, without the knowledge of which, mankind could hardly subsist."
"We discern society and civilization arising from rude beginnings, in every corner of the earth; and gradually advancing to the ftatc in which we now find them: All which afford plain evidence, that there was a period, when mankind began to inhabit and cultivate the earth. What is very rewarkable, the moll authentic chronology aid hitory of molt nations, coincides with the account of Scripture; and makes the period during which the world has been inhabited by the race of men, not to ex;end beyond fix thousand years."
"To the ancient philosophers, creation from nothing appearod aa unintelligible idea. They maintained the eternal existence.of matter, which they supposed to be modelled by the Ibvcreign mind of the universe, into the form which the earth now exhibits. But there is nothing in this opi- xlx."
"nion which gives it any title to be opposed to the authority of revelation. The doctrine of two felf-exiftent, independent principles, God and matter, the one active, the other passive, is a hypothesis which presents difficulties to human rcafon, at leait as great as the creation of matter from nothing. Adhering then to the testimony of Scripture, we believe, that in the beginning God created, or from non-existence brought into being, she heaven and the earth."
"But though there was a period when this globe, with all that we fee upon it, did not exist, we have no reason to think, that the wisdom and power of the Almighty were then without exercise or employment."
"Bouudlels is the extent of his dominion."
"Other globes and worlds, enlightened by other funs, may then have occupied, as they still appear to occupy, the immense regions of space. Numberless orders of beings, to us unknown, people the wide extent of the universe; and afford an endless variety 6  variety of objects to the ruling care of the .lx great Father of all. At length, in the course and progress of his government, there arrived a period, when this earth was to be called into existence. When the fignal moment, predestined from all eternity, was come, the Deity arose in his might; and with a word created the world. What an illustrious moment was that, when, from non-existence, there sprang at once into being, this mighty globe, on which so many millions of creatures now dwell!-No preparatory measures were required. No long circuit of means was employed. He fpak; and it was done: He commanded; and it fJood faf. The earth was at first, without form, and void; and darkntja was on theface of the deep. The Almighty surveyed the dark abyss; and fixed bounds to the several divisions of nature. He siid, Let there be light; and there was light. Then appeared the sea, and the dry land. The mountains rose; and the rivers flowed. The fun and moon began their course in the ikies. Herbs and plants cloathed cloathed the ground. The air, the earth, "
"and the waters, were storcd with their Xt._ fpecive inhabitants. At last, man was made after the image of God. He appeared, walking with countenance erea; and received his Creator benediction, as the Lord of this new world. The Almighty beheld his work when it was finished; and pronounced it good. Superior beings saw with wonder this new acceflion to existence."
"The morning fars fang together; and all the sons of God Jhoutedfor joy *."
"But, on this great work of creation, let us not merely gaze with astonishment. Let us confider how it fliould affect our condud, by presenting the divine perfections in a light which is at once edifying, and comforting, to man. It displays the Creator as supreme in power, in wisdom, and in goodness."
"I. As supreme in power. When we confider with how much labour and difficulty * Job xiviii. 7."
"human  human power performs its inconsiderable .a works; what time it cofis to rear them; "
"and how easily, when reared, they are destroyed; the very idea of creating power overwhelms the mind with awe. Let us look around, and survey this stupendous edifice, which we have been admitted to inhabit. Let us think of the extent of the different climates and regions of the earth; of the magnitude of the mountains, and of the expanse of the ocean. Let us conceive that immense globe which contains them, launched at once from the hand of the Almighty; made to revolve incessantly on its axis, that it might produce the vicissitudes of day and night; thrown forth, at the fame time, to run its annual course in perpetual circuit through the heavens; after such a meditation, where is the greatness, where is the pride of man ? Into what total annihilation do we fink, before an omnipotent Being ? Who is not disposed to exclaim, Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him ; or the son ns man, that tboujhouldf it him When compared wtitb thee, all men are vanity ; "
"vanity; tbhir works arc nothing.-- Reve- SE, Ml rence, and humble adoration, ought 1potl- taneouly to arise. He who feels no propenfity to worship and adore, is dead to all sense of grandeur and majesty; has extinguiihed one of the nmof natural feelings of the human heart. Kn the Lord, that he is God, we are all his people; thb workmanjhip of his bands. Let ts worJhip and bow down. Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker."
"Of all titles to legislation and rule, none is so evident and direct as that of a Creator. The convicion is felt in every breast, that he who gave us being, hath an abfolute right to regulate our conduct This gives a fanCion to the precepts of God, which the most hardened dare not controvert. When it is a Creator and a Father that speaks, who would not liften and obey? Are justice and humanity his declared laws; and fliall we, whom but yefterday he called from the dust, and whom to-morrow he can reduce into dust again, presume, in contempt of him, to be unjust or BERM. or inhuman? Are there any little interelts Ms_ of our own which we dare to erect, in opposition to the pleasure of him who made us? Fear ye not me, faitb the Lord; will ye not tremble at my prefnce, who have placed the Sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pss it; who firetch Jortb my band over the earth, and none binderethb At the fame time, the power of a Creator is encouraging, as well as awful. While it enforces duty, it inspires confidence under alHiction. It brings to view a relation, which imports tenderness and comfort; for it suggests the compassion of a father. In the time of trouble, mankind are led by natural impulle, to fly for aid to Him, who knows the weakness of the frame which he has made; who remembers we are dufl; and fees the dangers with which we are environed.  I am thine; for thou haft made  me; Forsake not the work of tlline own hands, is one of the molt natural ejaculations of the distressed mind.- How bleffed are the virtuous, who can reft under the protection proteftion of that powerful arm, which "
"made the earth and the heaven? The omnipotence which renders God so awful, is to them a source of joy. In the whole compass of nature, nothing is formidable to them, who firmly repose their trust in the Creator. To them, every noxious power can be rendered harmless; every threatened evil, if not averted, can be transformed into good. In the Author of nature, they find not only the author of their being; but their protector and defender, the lifter up of their heads. Happy is he that bath the God of Jacob for bis help; wbofe bope is in the Lord his God; which made heaven and earth, the fa, and all that therein is; 'which keepeth truth for ever ."
"II. THE work of creation is the display of supreme wisdom. It carries no character more conspicuous than this. If, from the firudture and mechanism of some of the mofi complicated works of human art, we are led Psalm cxlvi. 5. 6."
"to  to high admiration of the wisdom of the __ contriver, what aftoniflunent may fill our minds, when we think of the ftrucure of the univere ! It is not only the stupendous building itself, which excites admiration; but the exquisite skill, with which the endless variety of its parts are adapted to their refpetive purposes. Insomuch, that the study of nature, which, for ages, has employed the lives of Ib many learned men, and which is still Ib far from being exhaufted, is no other than the Rtudy of divine wisdom displayed in the creation. The farther our researches are carried, more striking proofs of it every where meet us."
"The provision made for the constant regularity of the universe, in the disposition of the heavenly bodies, so that in the course of several thousand years, nature should ever exhibit the fame useful and grateful variety, in the returns of light and darkness, of summer and winter; and ever furnifh food and habitation to all the animals that people the earth; must be a lalling theme of wonder to every refleting mind."
"But But they are not oniy the heavens that "
"decltarr the glory of God, and the finnament  that Jsiewetb forth his bandy wor. In the most inconiiderable, as well as in the most illuitrious works of the Creator, confunmmate art and design appear. There is not a creature that moves, nor a vegetable that grows, but, when minutely examined, furnihes materials of the highest admiration. The lame wisdom that placed the fun in the centre of the system, and arranged the feveral planets around him in their order, has no less Thown itself, in the provision made for the food and dwelling of every bird that roams the air, and every beat that wanders in the desert; equally great, in the smallest, and in the most magnificent objects; in the star, and in the inset; in the elephant, and in the fly; in the beam that thines from heaven, and in the grass that cloaths the ground. Nothing is overlooked. Nothing is carelessly performed."
"Every thing that exists, is adapted with perfef symmetry to the end for which it was designed. All this infinite variety of parVOL. 11. d ticular ticulars must have been prefcnt to the mind XIX."
"a-  of the Creator; all beheld with one glance of hit eye; all fixed and arranged, from the beginning, in his great design, when he formed the heavens and the earth. Justly may we exclaim with the Pfalmint, How excellent, 0 Lord, is /hy name in all the earbth How manifold are thy works ! In i/dom Lfi tbou made them all. A man can Jind out the work that God maketb, from the beginning to the end. Sucb knowledge is too wonderjiul for ur. It is bigb; we cannot attain unto it."
"This wisdom displayed by the Almighty in the creation, was not intended merely to gratify curiosity, and to raise wonder. It ought to beget profound fubmiflion, and pious trust, in every heart. It is not uncomalon for many who speak with rapture of creating wisdom, to be guilty, at the fame time, of arraigning the conduc of Providence. In the ftrufture of the universe, they confers that all is goodly and beautiful. But in the government of human asfairs, they can fee nothing but diobrder and confufion,-Have they forgotten, that both both the one, and the other, proceed from "
"the fame author ? Have they forgotten, that _ he who balanced all the heavenly bodies, and adjusted the proportions and limits of nature, is the fame who hath allotted them their condition in the world, who diftributes the measures of their prosperity and adversity, and fixes the bounds of their habitation ? If their lot appear to them ill forted, and their condition hard and unequal, let them only put the question to their own minds, Whether it be most probable, that the great and wife Creator hath erred in his distribution of human things, or that they have erred, in the judgement which they form concerning the lot afflgned to them? Can they believe, that the divine Artist, after he had contrived and frnished this earth, the habitation of men, with such admirable wisdom, would then throw it out of his hands as a neglected work; would fulffer the affairs of its inhabitants to proceed by chance; and would behold them without concern, running into mifnile and disorder? Where were then that consistenD d2 cy RM. cy of conduct, which we discover in all the ' works of nature, and which we cannot but ascribe to a perfect Being ?- My brother!"
"when thy plans are disappointed, and thy heart is ready to despair; when virtue is oppressed, and the wicked prosper around thee; in those moments of disturbance, look up to him who created the heaven and the earth; and confide, that he who made light to spring from primaval darkness, will make order at last to arise from the seeming confulion of the world."
"Had any one beheld the earth in its state of chaos; when the elements lay mixed and confused; when the earth was withoutform and void, and darknlef wa on the face of the deep; would he have believed, that it was presently to become so fair and well ordered a globe as we now behold; illumined with the splendor of the fun, and decorated with all the beauty of nature? The fame powerful hand, which perse the work of creation, (hall, in due time, disembroil the plans of Providence. Of creation, we can judge more clearly, because it Rood forth at at once; it was perse& from the beginning. "
"But the course of Providence is progreflive. "
"Time is required for the progression to advnnee; and before it is finiihed, we can form no judgement, or at least a very imperset one, concerning it. We must wait until the great :ra arrive, when the secrets of the universe shall be unfolded; when the divine designs {hall be consummated; when Providence shalt be brought to the fame completion which creation has already attained. Then, we have every reason to believe, that the wife Crector {hall apper in the end, to have been the wife and jtft tuler of the world. Until that period come, let us be conrented and patient; let uis rubmit and adore. Although tbou fayeft tbou Jba fotfte him, yet judgement i before bim; tberefore, ttarf tou in him*, This exhortation will receive more force, when we, "

" power. It is the communication of numXIX  berlefs benefits to all who live, together with existence. Justly is the earth said to befull of the goodness of the Lord. Throughout the whole system of things, we behold a manifest tendency to promote the benefit either of the rational, or the animal creation. In some parts of nature, this tendency may be less obvious than in others. Objests, which to us seem useless, or hurtful, may sometimes occur; and strange it were, if in so vast and complicated a system, difficulties of this kind lhould not occasionally present themselves to beings, whose views are so narrow and limited as ours. It is well known, that in proportion as the knowledge of nature has increased among men, there difficulties have diminished. Satisfactory accounts have been given of many perplexing appearances. Useful and proper purposes have been found to be promoted, by objects which were, at first, thought unprofitable or noxious."
"Malignant must be the mind of that person; with a distorted eye he must have contemplated templated creation, who can fufpet, that RM."
"it is not the production of infinite benignity and goodness. How many clear marks of benevolent intention appear, every where around us ? What a profusion of beauty and ornament is poured forth on the face of nature? What a magnificent spectacle presented to the view of man? What supply contrived for his wants ? What a variety of objects let before him, to gratify his senses, to employ his understanding, to entertain his imagination, to cheer and gladden his heart? Indeed, the very exiltence ,of;the universe is a flanding memorial qs the goodness of the Creator. For nothing exr cept goodaefs could originally prompt creation. The supreme Being, felf-exitent and all-fuflicient, had no wants which he could seek to supply. No new acceflion of felicity or glory was to result to him, from creatures whom he made. It was goodness communicating and pouring itself forth, goodness delighting to impart happiness in all its forms, which in the beginning created die heaven and the earth. Hence, "
"D 4 those it  those innumerable orders of living creatures 1-1 _ with which the earth is peopled ; irom the loweCf class of sensitive being, to the highelt rank of reatbn and intelligence. Whereever there is lite, there is foine degree of happiness; there are enjoyments suited to the different powers of feeling; and earth, and air, and water, are, with magnificent liberality, made to teem with life."
"Let those fttriking displays of creating goodness call forth, on our part, responsive love, gratitude, and veneration. To this great Father of all existence and life, to Him who hath raised us up to behold the light of day, and to enjoy all the comforts which his world prefeats, let our hearts fend forth a perpetual hymn of praise."
"Evening and morning let us celebrate Him, who maketh the morning and the evening to rejoice over our heads; who openethb bi hand, and /atisfitb the desire of every living thing. Let us rejoice, that we are brought into a world, which is the production of infinite goodness; over which a supreme intelligence presides; and where nothing happens, "
"happens, that was not planned and arran- ERM."
"ged, from the beginning, in his decree. X1X."
"vinced that he hateth not the works which he hath made, nor hath brought creatures into existence, merely to susser unnecessary pain, let us, even in the midit of sorrow, receive, with calm fubmiTlion, whatever he is pleased to fend; thankful for what he betlows; and satisfied, that, without good reason, he takes nothing away."
"SUCH, in general, are the effects which meditation on the creation of the world ought to produce. It presents such an atonilhing conjunction of power, wisdom, and goodness, as cannot be beheld without religious veneration Accordingly, among all nations of the earth, it has given rife to religious belief and worfiip. The most ignorant and savage tribes, when they looked round on the earth and the heavens, could not avoid ascribing their origin to some invisible designing cause, and feeling a propensity to adore. They are, indeed, the awful appearances of the Cretoi power, "
"by ERM, by which, chiefly, they have been impreirf X1X  and which have introduced into their worship so many rites of dark superitltion."
"When the usual course of nature leemuid to be interrupted; when loud thunder rolled above them in the clouds, or earthquakes shook the ground, the multitude fell on their knees, and, with trembling horror, brought forth the bloody sacrifice to appease the angry divinity. But it is not in those tremendous appearances of power merely, that a good and well-inftruced man beholds the Creator of the world. In the constant and regular working of his hands, in the silent operations of his wisdom and goodness, ever going on throughout nature, he delights to contemplate and adore him."
"This is one of the chief fruits to be derived from that more perfec knowledge of the Creator, which is imparted to us by the Christian revelation. Impressing our minds with a just sense of all his attributes, as not wife and great only, but as gracious and merciful, let it lead us to view every object of of calm and undisturbed nature, with a perpetual reference to its author. We {hall  then behold all the tcenes which the heavens and the earth present, with more refined feelings, and sublimer emotions than they who regard them solely as objects of curiosity, or amutfement. Nature will appear animated, and enlivened, by the prefence of its author. When the fun rife#"
"or sets in the heavens; when spring paints the earth, when summer shines in its glory, when autumn pours forth its fruits, or winter returns in its awful forms, we shall view the Creator manifesting himself in his works. We shall meet his presence in the fields. We shall feel his influence in the cheering beam. We hall hear his voice in the wind. We hall behold ourselves every where surrounded with the glory of that universal spirit, who fills, pervades, and upholds all. We hall live in the world as in a great and august temple; where the presence of the divinity, who inhabits it, inspires devotion."

"BERM. is, it was not, however, intended for per][IX. ,_-' petual duration. It was erected as a temporary habitation for a race of beings, who, after acting there a probationary part, were to be removed into a higher state of existence. As there was an hour fixed from all eternity for its creation, so there is an hour fixed for its dissolution; when the heavens and the earth shall pass away, and their place {hall know them no more. The confideration of this great event, as the counterpart to the work of creation, ihall be the fubje& of the following Discourse."

"But the day of tbe Lord will come as a tbitf in the night; in tbe which tbe heavens fial pass away with a great noifc, and the elements Jball melt with fervent beat; the earth also, and the works that are therein, fihall be burnt up."
"THESE words present to us an awful SERl'"
"view of the final catastrophe of the ._ world. Having treated, in the preceding Discourse, of the commencement, let us now contemplate the close, of all human things. The dissolution of the material fyfltem is an article of our faith, often alluded   ded to in the Old Testament, clearly prexx. diced in the New. It is an article of faith so far from being incredible, that many appearances in nature lead to the belief of it. We fee all terrestrial substances changing their form. Nothing that conflits of matter, is formed for perpetual duration."
"Every thing around us, is impaired and consumcd by time; waxes old by degrees, and tends to decay. There is rcalbn, therefore, to believe, that a Itrudure lo complex as the world mutt be liable to the fame law; and lhall, at some period, undergo the fame fate. Through many changes, the earth has already passed; many thocks it has received, and fill is often receiving. A great portion of what is now dry land appears, from various tokens, to have been once covered with water. Continents bear the marks of having been violently rent, and torn asunder from one another. New islands have risen from the bottom of the ocean; thrown up by the force of fubterraneous fire. Formidable earthquakes have, in divers quarters, lhaken the globe; and at at this hour terrify, with their alarms, ma- ."
"xx ny parts of it. Burning mountains have, _ for awes, been difchargine torrents of flame; and from time to time renew their explosions, in various regions. All these circumstances lhow, that in the bowels of the earth, the instruments of its dissolution are formed. To our view, who behold only its surface, it may appear firm and unihaken; while its defiruclion is preparing in secret. The ground on which we tread is undermined. Combuflible materials are stored. The train is laid. When the mine is to spring, none of us can foresee."
"Accustomed to behold the course of nature proceeding in regular order, we indulge, meanwhile, our pleasures and pursuits with tull ecurity; and such awful scenes as the convulsion of the elements, and the dissolution of the world, are soreign to our thoughts. Yet, as it is certain that some generation of men mull witness this great catastrophe, it is fit and proper that we should sometimes look forward to it. Such prolpets may not, indeed, be al."
"luring SE FRK luring to the bulk of men. But they carry xx."
"a grandeur and lolemnity, which are congenial to some of the most dignified feelings in our nature; and tend to produce elevation of thought. Amidt the circle of levities and follies, of little pleasures and little cares, which fill up the ordinary round of life, it is necessary that we be occasionally excited to attend to what is serious and great. Such events as are now to be the subjec of our meditation, awake the slumbering mind; check the licentioufnefi of idle thought, and bring home our recollection to what most concerns us, as men and Christians."
"Let us think what astonishment would have filled our minds, and what devout etotions would have swelled our hearts, if we could have been fpecators of the creation of the world; if we had seen the earth when it arose at first withoetform and eid, and beheld its parts arranged by the divine word; if we had heard the voice of the Almighty, calling light to spring forth from the darkns that was on face of the deep; if if we had seen the fun arising, for the first time, in the east with majestic glory; and all nature instantly beginning to teem with life. This wonderful scene, it was impoffible that any human eye could behold. It was a fpedacle afforded only to angels, and superior spirits. But to a fpeAacle no less aftonilhing, the final dissolution of the world, we know there {hall be many human witnesses. The race of men living in that last age, shall fee the presages of the approaching fatal day. There (hall befigns in the Jun, as the Scripture informs us, and signs in the moon, and fiars; upon the earth, direfi of nations, with perplexity; the fca and the waves roaring *. They (hall clearly perceive, that universal nature is tending to ruin. They {hall feel the globe mhake; shall behold their cities fall; and the final conflagration begin to kindle around them.- Realising then this awful scene; imagining ourselves to be already fpecfators of it, let us, "
"VOL. III. I. CoN."
"SERMI. I. CONTEMPLATE the Supreme Being -_.. directing the diliblution, as he directed the original formation, of the world. He is the great agent in this wonderful tranfaction. It was by him foreicen. It was by him intendedl; it entered into his plan from the moment of creation. This world was dettined from the beginning to fulfil a certain period; and then its duration was to terminate. Not that it is any pleasure to the Almighty, to di(play his omnipotence in destroying the works which he has made; but as for wile and good purposes the earth was formed, so for wile and good ends it is dilrolved, when the time most proper for its termination is come. He who, in the counsels of his Providence, brings about lb many revolutions among mankind; who changeIt the times and the fieafis; who railes up empires to rule, in flcceflion, among the nations, and at his pleasure puts an end to their glory; hath also fixed a term for the earth itself, the feat of all human greatne  He law it meet, that after the probationary courie was liniihed, which the generations generations of men were to accomplish, ER "
"their present habitation thould be made to xx."
"pafls away. Of the seasonableness of the period when this change should take place, no being can judge, except the Lord of the universe. These are counsels, into which it is not ours to penetrate. But amidst this great revolution of nature, our comfort is, that it is a revolution brought about by Him, the measures of whose government are all founded in goodness."
"It is called in the text, the day of te Lord; "
"a day peculiarly his, as known to lhim only; a day in which he ihall appear with uncommon and tremendous majesty. But though it be the day of the terrors of the Lord, yet from theft terrors, his upright and faithful fubjeds liall have nothing to apprehend. They may remain safe and quiet fpedtators of the threatening scene."
"For it is not to be a scene of blind confu, sion; of universal ruin, brought about by undesigning chance. Over the ihock of the elements, and the wreck of nature, Eternal Wisdom presides. According to its 2 direction, "
" direction, the conflagration advances which XX_ is to consume the earth. Amidst every convulsion of the world, God shall continue to be, as he was from the beginning, the dwelling-place of bis servants to all generations. The world may be loft to them; but the ruler of the world is ever the fame, unchangeably good and jut. This is the bigb tower to which they can fly, and be safe. The righteous Lord lovetb rigbteoufness; and under every period of his government, bis countenance beholdeth the upright."
"II. LET us contemplate the dissolution of the world, as the end of all human glory."
"This earth has been the theatre of many a great fpeaacle, and many a high atchievement. There, the wife have ruled, the mighty have fought, and conquerors have triumphed. Its surface has been covered with proud and stately cities. Its temples and palaces have raised their heads to the skies. Its kings and potentates, glorying in their magnificence, have ereced pyramids, conftruted towers, founded monuments, which they imagined were to defy  xx."
"all the alfaults of time. Their inward _ tbought was, that their bouses were to continu for ever, and their dwellig-places to all generations. Its philosophers have explored the secrets of nature; and flattered themselves, that the fame of their discoveries was to be immortal. Alas ! all this was no more than a transient ihow. Not only the faJbion of the world, but the world itself, pajfeth away. The day cometh, when all the glory of this world shall be remembered, only as a dream when one awaketh."
"No longer shall the earth exhibit any of those scenes which now delight our eyes."
"The whole beautiful fabric is thrown down, never more to arise. As soon as the destroying angel has founded the last trumpet, the everlasting mountains fall; the foundations of the world are ihaken; the beauties of nature, the decorations of art, the labours of induilry, periih in one common flame, The globe itself ihall either return into its ancient chaos, without form and void; or, like a star fallen from the e 3 heavens, "
" hcavcns, shall be effaced from the universe, "
"and its plare shall know it no more."
"THIS day of the Lord, it is foretold in the text, will come as a thief in the night; that is, sudden and unexpected. Mankind, notwithstanding the presages given them, ihall continue to the last in their wonted security. Our Saviour tells us, that as in the days of Noah before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, Yntil the flood came, and took them all away; foJhall also the coming of the Son of tan be .- How many projeits and designs shall that day iuddenly confound?"
"What long-contrived schemes of pleasure ihall it overthrow? What plans of cunning and ambition shall it utterly blast? How iiferable they, whom it shall overtake in the midst of dark conspiracies, of criminal deeds, or profligate pleasures? In what firong colours is their dismay painted, when they are represented in the book of Revelations, as calling to the bills and mountains to fall on them and cver them? --Such  _ scriptions are apt to be confidered as exaggerated. The imprellion of those awful events is weakened by the great diftancc of time, at which our imagination places them. But have not we had a striking image set before us, in our own age, of the terrors which the day of the Lord ihall produce, by those partial ruins of the world, which the vlfitation of God has brought on countries well known, and not removed very far froth ourselves ? When in the midst of peace, opulence, aid security, suddenly the earth was felt by the terrified inhabitants to tremble, with violent agitation, below them; when their houses began to shake over their heads, and to overwhelm them with ruins; the flood, at the fame time, to rife from its bed, and to swell around them; when encompassed with universal desolation, no friend could aid another; no prospect of escape appeared; no place of refuge remained; how similar were such scenes of defiruntion to the terrors of the lat day?"
"E 4 What  What finilar sensations of dread, and rexx. -,._ morse, and too late repentance, must they have excited among the guilty and profane ?"
"To such formidable convulsions  nature, we, in these happy islands, through the blessing of Heaven, are strangers; and strangers to them may we long continue!"
"But however we may escape partial ruins of the globe, in its general and final ruin, we also muff be involved. To us must come at last that awful day, when the fun shall for the last time arise, to perform his concluding circuit round the world. They how blest, whom that day ihall find employed in religious aAs, or virtuous deeds; in the conscientious discharge of the duties of life; in the exercise of due preparation for the conclusion of human things, and for appearing before the great Judge of the world! Let us now, "
"III. CONTEMPLATE the foul of man, as remaining unhurt in the midst of this general desolation, when the whole animal crea."
"tion perishes, and the whole frame of na- "
"ture falls into ruins. What a high idea xx does this present, of the dignity pertaining to the rational spirit! The world may fall back into chaos; but, superior to matter, and independent of all the changes of material things, the foul continues the fame."
"When the heavens pass away with a great noir, and the klement melt with fervent beat, the foul of man, stamped for immortality, retains its state unimpaired; and is capable offlourishing in undecaying youth and vigour. Very different indeed the condition of human spirits is to be, according as their different qualities have marked, and prepared them, for different future mansions. But for futurity, they are all deftined. Existence, still, is theirs. The capacity of permanent felicity they all pof fess; and, if they enjoy it not, it is owing to themselves."
"Here then, let us behold what is the true honour and excellence of man. It confifls not in his body; which, beautiful or vigorous as it may now seem, is no other than a SE kM. a fabrick of dust, quicklyto return to;dmft ,__ again. Iris not derived ftom any connection he can form with earthly things; which, as we have seen, are all doomed to perilh."
"It c6lofifts in that thinking part, which is ffffcepfible of intellecdual improvetent and moral worth; which was fortned after the image of God; which is capable of peretual progress in drawing nearer to his hature; and shall partalke of the divine eternity, when time and the world shall be no'
more. This is all that is refpetable in man.'
By this alone, he is raised above perishable substances, and allied to those that are celeftial and immortal. This part of our na; ture, then, let us cultivate with care; andi on its improvement, reft our felf-eftimatirn.
If, on the contrary, fufifring ourfeltes to be wholly immersed in matter, plunged in the dregs of fenfualiky we behhve as if we were only made for the body and its anim real pleasures, how degenerate and bas edo we become ? Destined to fhrvire this whole material system, sent forth to rin the race of immortality and glory, shall we thus'abnfe our our Maker goodness, degrade our origi- 
nal honour, and fink ourselves into defer- _XX ved misery? It remains, that,   WE contemplate the dissolution of the world, as the introducion to a greater and nobler lyfttm, in the government of God. We, acrording to bis promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth rightrofteSfi *. Temporal things are now to give place to things eternal. To this earthly habitation is to succeed the city of the living God. The earth had completed the purpose for which it was created.
It had been employed as a theatre, on which the human generations were successively to come forth, and to fulfil their term of trial.
As long as the period of trial continued, much obscurity was of course to cover the counrels of Providence. It was appointed, that all things should appear as coming alike to all; that the righteous should seem often neglected by Heaven, and the wicked be * a Peter, iii. 1.

allowed allowed externally to profpcr; in order that As_, virtue and piety might undergo a proper tef; that it might be ihown who were fincere adherents to conscience, and who were mere followers of fortune. The day which terminates the duration of the world, terminates all those teeming disorders. The time of trial is concluded. The final difcrimination of characers is made. When the righteous go to everlasting happiness, and the wicked are dismissed into the regions of puniihment, the whole mystery of human affairs is unravelled; and the condut of Providence is jultified to man.

Suited to a condition of trial was the state and form of the world, which we now in.
habit. It was not designed to be a mansion for innocent and happy spirits; but a dwelling for creatures of fallen nature, and of mixed characters. Hence, those mixtures of pleasure and pain, of disorder and beauty, with which it abounds. Hence, some regions of the earth, prefentinggay and pleasing scenes; others, exhibiting nothing but ruggcdnefs and deformity; the face of nature, 
nature, sometimes brightened by a serene atmosphere, and a splendid fun; sometimes XX.
disfigured by jarring elements, and overcast with troubled skies. But far unlike shall be the everlasting habitations of the just: Though how they are formed, or what objects they contain, is not given us now to conceive; nor, in all probability, would our faculties be equal to the conception. The emblematical descriptions of them in Scripture, are calculated to excite high ideas of magnificence and glory. This one particular we know with certainty, that therein dwelletb righteousness; that is, complete virtue and eternal order; and whereever there are found, the molt perfec sources are opened of joy and bliss. This earth was never intended for more than the outer court, the porch, through which the righteous were to pass into the temple and fanduary of the Divinity. When that which is perfct is come, that which is in partJhall be done away.

THE inference which follows from what has  has been said on this subjet, cannot be so Xx.  well exprcffcd as in the words of the Apostle, 
in the verse immediately following the text; feeing that all theft things Jball be dirolved, what manner of person ought we to be in all holy conversation and godlinefi? Ought not the important discoveries which have been made to us, of the designs of the Almighty, and of the destiny of man, to exalt our feno timents, and to purify our life from what is vitious or vain? While we purlfu the bufinefa and cares of our present station, and partake of the innocent pleasures which the world affords, let us maintain that dignity of charader, which becomes immortal beings; let us as with that circumfpeclion, which becomes those who know they are soon to stand before the judgement-feat of the Son of God: In a word, let us study to be what we would wish to be found, if to us the day of the Lord should come.

I KNOW it will occur, that the profped of that day cannot be expe to have much influence on the present age. The events of of which I have treated, must needs, it will 
be said, belong to fume future race of men. _ Many prophecies yet remain to be fulfilled.
Many preparatory events must take place, before the world is ripe for final judgement.
-Whether this be the cafe or not, none of us with certainty know.-But allow me to remind you, that to each of us, an event is approaching, and not far distant, which liall prove of the fame effeA, with the coming of the day of the Lord. The day of death is, to every individual, the fame as the day of the dissolution of the world.
The fun may continue to shine; but to them who are laid in the grave, his light is finally extiguiflied. The world may remain active, busy, and noisy; but to them, all is silence. The voice which gives the mandate, Return again to your duJf, is the fame with the found of the last trumpet.
Death fixes the doom of every one, finally and irrevocably. This surely is an event which none of us can remove in our thoughts to a remote age. To-morrow, to-day, the fatal mandate may be if sued.
  sued. Watch therefore; be fober and vigi_ _Â· lant; ye know not at what hour the Son of Man cometb.

HAVING now treated both of the creation and dissolution of the world, I cannot conclude, without calling your thoughts to the magnificent view, which these events give us, of the kingdom and dominion of the Almighty. With reverence we contemplate his hand in the signal difpenfations of Providence among men; deciding the fate of battles; raising up, or overthrowing empires; calling down the proud, and lifting the low from the dust. But what are such occurrences to the power and wisdom, which He displays in the higher revolutions of the universe; by his word, forming, or dissolving worlds; at his pleasure, transplanting his creatures from one world to another; that he may carry on new plans of wisdom and goodness, and fill all space with the wonders of creation !
Successive generations of men have arisen to possess the earth. By turns they have pased passed away, and gone into regions un- 
known. Us he hath raised up, to occupy - 
their room. We too shall shortly disappear.
But human existence never perifies. Life only changes its form, and is renewed.
Creation is ever filling, but never full.
When the whole intended course of the generations of men shall be finished, then, as a shepherd leads his flock from one pasture to another, so the great Creator leads forth the fouls which he has made, into new and prepared abodes of life. They go from this earth to a new earth, and new heavens; and still they remove, only from one province of the divine dominion to another.
Amidst all those changes of nature, the great Ruler himself remains, without variableneJf ,,rbhadow of turning. To him, these fucceflive revolutions of being are but as yesterday when it is pqft. From his eternal throne, he beholds worlds rising and passing away; measures out, to the creatures who inhabit them, powers and faculties suited to their state; and distributes among them rewards and punishments, proportioned to their acVOL.
