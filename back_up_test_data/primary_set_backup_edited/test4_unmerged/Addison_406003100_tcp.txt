"               The March concludes, the various Realms are past,"
"                Immortal Schellenberg appears at last:"
"               Like Hills  aspiring Ramparts rise on high,"

"               Thick'ning their Ranks, and wedged in firm Array,"
"               The close compacted Brittons win their Way;"
"               "
