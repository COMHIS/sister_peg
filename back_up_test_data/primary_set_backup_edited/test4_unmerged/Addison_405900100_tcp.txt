"               Pray what good did your being visible do you? the fair Mr. Fantome thought no Woman coued withstand him—But when you were seen by my Lady in your proper Person, after she had taken a full survey of you, and heard all the pretty things you coued say, she very civilly dismissed you for the sake of this empty, noisy Creature Tinsel. She fancies you have been gone from hence this Fortnight."

"               You are very much mistaken, Mr. Fantome; but no mat-ter for that; here is to be your Station to Night. This is the Place unknown to any one living besides my self, since the Death of the Joyner; who, you must understand, being a Lover of mine, contrived the Wainscot to move to and fro, in the manner that you find it. I designed it for a Wardrobe for my Lady cast"

"               To tell thee-truly, I loved him well enough till I found he loved me so much. But Mr. Tinsel makes his Court to me with so much Neglect and Indifference, and with such an agree-able Sauciness—Not that I say I'll marry him."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Marry him, quoth-a! no, if you should, you'll be awa-kened sooner than married Couples generally are—You'll quick-ly have a Drum at your Window."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               I'll hide my Contempt of Tinsel for once, if it be but to see what this Wench drives at. [Aside."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Why, suppose your Husband, after this fair Warning he has given you, shoued sound you an Alarm at Midnight; then open your Curtains with a Face as pale as my Apron, and cry out with a hollow Voice, What dost thou do in Bed with this Spindle-shanked Fellow?"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Why wilt thou needs have it to be my Husband? he never had any reason to be offended at me. I always loved him while he was living, and shoued prefer him to any Man, were he so still. Mr. Tinsel is indeed very idle in his Talk, but I fancy, Abigal, a discreet Woman might reform him."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               That a likely matter indeed; did you ever hear of a Wo-man who had Power over a Man, when she was his Wife, that had none while she was his Mistress! Oh! there nothing in the World improves a Man in his Complaisance like Mar-riage!"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               He is indeed, at present, too familiar in his Conver-sation."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Familiar! Madam, in Troth he down-right rude."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               But that you know, Abigal, shows he has no Dissimu-lation in him—Then he is apt to jest a little too much upon grave Subjects."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Grave Subjects! he jests upon the Church."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               But that you know, Abigal, may be only to show his Wit—Then it must be owned, he is extreamly Talkative."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Talkative ye call it! he down-right Impertinent."
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               Lady."
"               But that you know, Abigal, is a Sign he has been used to good Company—Then indeed he is very positive."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Positive! Why he contradicts you in every thing you say."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               But then you know, Abigal, he has been educated at the Inns of Court."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               A blessed Education indeed! it has made him forget his Catechism!"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               You talk as if you hated him."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               You talk as if you loved him."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Hold your Tongue! here he comes."
"            "
"            Enter Tinsel."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               My dear Widow!"
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               My dear Widow! marry come up! [Aside."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Let him alone, Abigal; so long as he does not call me My dear Wife, there no Harm done."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               I have been most ridiculously diverted since I left you—Your Servants have made a Convert of my Booby. His Head is so filled with this foolish Story of a Drummer, that I expect the Rogue will be afraid hereafter to go upon a Message by Moon-light."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Ah, Mr. Tinsel, what a Loss of Billet-doux would that be to many a fine Lady!"
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Then you still believe this to be a foolish Story? I thought my Lady had told you, that she had heard it her self."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Ha, ha, ha!"
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Why, you would not perswade us out of our Senses?"
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Ha, ha, ha!"
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               There Manners for you, Madam. [Aside."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Admirably rallyed! that Laugh is unanswerable! Now I'll be hanged if you could forbear being witty upon me, if I should tell you I heard it no longer ago than last Night."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Fancy!"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               But what if I should tell you my Maid was with me!"
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Vapours! Vapours! Pray, my dear Widow, will you answer me one Question?—Had you ever this Noise of a Drum in your Head, all the while your Husband was living?"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               And pray, Mr. Tinsel, will you let me ask you another Question? Do you think we can Hear in the Country, as well as you do in Town?"
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               Tin."
"               Believe me, Madam, I could prescribe you a Cure for these Imaginations."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Don tell my Lady of Imaginations, Sir, I have heard it my self."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Hark thee, Child—art thou not an old Maid?"
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Sir, if I am, it is my own Fault."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Whims! Freaks! Megrims! indeed Mrs. Abigal."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Marry, Sir, by your Talk one would believe you thought every thing that was good is a Megrim."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Why truly I don very well understand what you meant by your Doctrine to me in the Garden just now, that every thing we saw was made by Chance."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               A very pretty Subject indeed for a Lover to divert his Mistress with."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               But I suppose that was only a Taste of the Conver-sation you would entertain me with after Marriage."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Oh, I shall then have time to read you such Lectures of Motions, Atoms, and Nature—that you shall learn to think as Freely as the best of us, and be convinced in less than a Month, that all about us is Chance-work."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               You are a very complaisant Person indeed; and so you would make your Court to me, by perswading me that I was made by Chance!"
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Ha, ha, ha! well said, my Dear! why, faith, thou wert a very lucky Hit, that certain!"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Pray, Mr. Tinsel, where did you learn this odd way of talking?"
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Ah, Widow,  it is your Country Innocence makes you think it an odd way of talking."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               though  you give no Credit to Stories of Apparitions, I hope you believe there are such things as Spirits!"
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Simplicity!"
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               I fancy you don believe Women have Souls, ye Sir?"
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Foolish enough!"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               I vow, Mr. Tinsel, I afraid malicious People will say I in Love with an Atheist."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Oh, my Dear, that an old-fashioned Word—I a Free-thinker, Child."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               I am sure you are a Free-speaker!"
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               Lady."
"               Really, Mr. Tinsel, considering that you are so fine a Gentleman, I amazed where you got all this Learning! I wonder it has not spoiled your Breeding."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               To tell you the Truth, I have not time to look into these dry Matters my self, but I am convinced by four or five learned Men, whom I sometimes over-hear at a Coffee-house I frequent, that our Fore-fathers were a Pack of Asses, that the World has been in an Error for some Thousands of Years, and that all the People upon Earth, excepting those two or three worthy Gentlemen, are imposed upon, cheated, bubbled, abused, bamboozled—"
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Madam, how can you hear such a Profligate? he talks like the London Prodigal."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Why really, I a thinking, if there be no such things as Spirits, a Woman has no Occasion for marrying—She need not be afraid to lye by her self."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Ah! my Dear! are Husbands good for nothing but to frighten away Spirits? Dost thou think I could not instruct thee in several other Comforts of Matrimony?"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Ah! but you are a Man of so much Knowledge, that you would always be laughing at my Ignorance—You learn Men are so apt to despise one!"
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               No, Child! Ied teach thee my Principles, thou should'st be as wise as I am—in a Week time."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Do you think your Principles would make a Woman the better Wife?"
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Prithee, Widow, don be queer."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               I love a gay Temper, but I would not have you rally things that are serious."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Well enough faith! where the Jest of rallying any thing else!"
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Ah, Madam, did you ever hear Mr. Fantome talk at this Rate? [Aside."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               But where this Ghost! this Son of a Whore of a Drummer? Ied fain hear him methinks."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Pray, Madam, don suffer him to give the Ghost such ill Language, especially when you have Reason to believe it is my Master."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               That well enough faith; Nab; dost thou think thy Master is so unreasonable, as to continue his Claim to his Re-lict"
"after his Bones are laid? Pray, Widow, remember the Words of your Contract, you have fulfilled them to a Tittle—Did not you marry Sir George to the Tune of 'till Death us do part?"
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               I must not hear Sir George Memory treated in so slight a Manner—This Fellow must have been at some Pains make himself such a finished Coxcomb. [Aside."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Give me but Possession of your Person, and I'll whirle you up to Town for a Winter, and cure you at once. Oh! I have known many a Country Lady come to London with frightful Stories of the Hall-House being haunted, of Fairies, Spirits, and Witches; that by the time she had seen a Come-dy, played at an Assembly, and ambled in a Ball or two, has been so little afraid of Bugbears, that she has ventured home in a Chair at all Hours of the Night."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Hum—Sauce-box. [Aside."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"                it is the Solitude of the Country that creates these Whimsies; there was never such a thing as a Ghost heard of at London, except in the Play-house—Oh weed pass all our time in London.  it is the Scene of Pleasure and Diversions, where there something to amuse you every Hour of the Day. Life not Life in the Country."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Well then, you have an Opportunity of showing the Sincerity of that Love to me which you profess. You may give a Proof that you have an Affection to my Person, not my Jointure."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Your Jointure! How can you think me such a Dog! But, Child, won your Jointure be the same thing in London as in the Country?"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               No, you're deceived! You must know it is settled on me by Marriage-Articles, on Condition that I live in this old Mansion-House, and keep it up in Repair."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               How!"
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."

"               Tin."
"               Why faith I have been looking upon this House, and think it is the prettiest Habitation I ever saw in my Life."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Ay, but then this cruel Drum!"

"               Lady."
"               Ay, but the Drum!"

"               Tin."
"               How pleasantly we two could pass our Time in this delicious Situation. Our Lives woued be a continued Dream of Happiness. Come, faith, Widow, let go upon the Leads, and take a View of the Country."

"               Lady."
"               Ay, but the Drum! the Drum!"

"               Tin."
"               My Dear, take my Word for  it is all Fancy: Besides, shoued he drum in thy very Bed-Chamber, I shoued only hug thee the closer."
"               Clasped in the Folds of Love, Ied meet my Doom,"
"               And act my Joys, though  Thunder shook the Room."

"            SCENE opens, and discovers Vellum in his Office, and a Letter in his Hand."
"            "
"               Vel."
"               THIS Letter astonisheth; may I believe my own Eyes—or rather my Spectacles—"
"                     "
"                        To Humphrey Vellum "

"                        I Doubt not but you will be glad to hear your Master is alive, and designs to be with you in half an Hour. The Report of my being slain in the Netherlands, has, I find, produced some Dis-orders in my Family. I am now at the George-Inn: If an old Man with a grey Beard, in a black Cloak, enquires after you, give him Admittance. He passes for a Conjurer, but is really"
"                        "
"                           Your Faithful Friend,  Truman."
"                           "
"                        "
"                        "
"                           "
"                               Let this be a Secret, and you shall find your Account in it."

"                     "
"                  "
"This amazeth me! and yet the Reasons why I should believe he is still living are manifold—First, Because this has often been the Case of other Military Adventurers."
"               Secondly, Because the News of his Death was first published in Dier Letter."
"               "
"               Thirdly, Because this Letter can be written by none but himself—I know his Hand, and manner of Spelling."
"               Fourthly,—"
"            "
"            Enter Butler."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Sir, here a strange old Gentleman that asks for you; he says he a Conjurer, but he looks very suspicious; I wish he ben a Jesuit."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Admit him immediately."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               I wish he ben a Jesuit; but he says he nothing but a Conjurer."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               He says right—He is no more than a Conjurer. Bring him in and withdraw. [Exit Butler."
"                  "
"               "
"               And Fourthly, As I was saying, Because—"
"            "
"            "
"               "
"Enter Butler with Sir George."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Sir, here is the Conjurer—What a devilish long Beard he has! I warrant it has been growing these hundred Years. [Aside. Exit."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               Dear Vellum, you have received my Letter: But before we proceed lock the Door."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               It is his Voice."
"               [Shuts the Door."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir. "
"               In the next place help me off with this cumbersome Cloak."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               It is his Shape."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               So, now lay my Beard upon the Table."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               "
"                  [After having looked on Sir George throed his Spectacles] It is his Face, every Lineament!"
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               Well now, I have put off the Conjurer and the old Man, I can talk to thee more at my Ease."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Believe me, my good Master, I am as much rejoiced to see you alive, as I was upon the Day you were born. Your Name was, in all the News-Papers, in the List of those that were slain."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               We have not Time to be particular. I shall only tell thee in general, that I was taken Prisoner in the Battle, and was under close Confinement for several Months. Upon my Release, I was resolved to surprize my Wife with the News of my being alive. I know, Vellum, you are a Person of so much Penetration, that I need not use any further Arguments to con-vince you that I am so:"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               I am—and moreover, I question not but your good Lady will likewise be convinced of it. Her Ho—nour is a dis-cerning Lady."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               I only afraid she shoued be convinced of it to her Sorrow. Is not she pleased with her imaginary Widowhood? Tell me truly, was she afflicted at the Report of my Death?"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Sorely."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               How long did her Grief last?"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Longer than I have known any Widow at least three Days."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               Three Days, sayst thou? Three whole Days? I afraid thou flatterest me! Woman! Woman!"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Grief is twofold."
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               Sir "
"               This Blockhead is as methodical as ever—but I know he honest. [Aside."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               There is a real Grief, and there is a methodical Grief; she was drowned in Tears 'till such time as the Taylor had made her Widow Weeds—Indeed they became her."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               Became her! And was that her Comfort? Truly a most seasonable Consolation!"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               But I must needs say she paid a due Regard to your Memory, and could not forbear weeping when she saw Com-pany."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               That was kind indeed! I find she grieved with a great deal of Good-Breeding. But how comes this Gang of Lovers about her?"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Her Jointure is considerable."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               How this Fool torments me! [Aside."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Her Person is amiable—"
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               Death! [Aside."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               But her Character is unblemished. She has been as vir-tuous in your Absence as a Penelope—"
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               And has had as many Suitors."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Several have made their Overtures."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               Several!"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               But she has rejected all."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               There thou reviv'st me—But what means this Tinsel? Are his Visits acceptable?"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               He is young."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               Does she listen to him?"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               He is gay."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               Sure she could never entertain a Thought of marry such a Coxcomb!"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               He is not ill made."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               Are the Vows and Protestations that past between us come to this! I can bear the Thought of it! Is Tinsel the Man designed for my worthy Successor?"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               You do not consider that you have been dead these fourteen Months—"
"            "
"            "
"               Sir. "
"               Was there ever such a Dog? [Aside."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               And I have often heard her say, that she must never expect to find a second Sir  Truman—meaning your Ho—nour."
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               Sir "
"               I think she loved me; but I must search into this Story of the Drummer before I discover my self to her. I have put on this Habit of a Conjurer, in order to introduce my self. It must be your Business to recommend me as a most profound Person, that by my great Knowledge in the curious Arts can silence the Drummer, and dispossess the House."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               I am going to lay my Accounts before my Lady, and I will endeavour to prevail upon her Ho—nour to admit the Tryal of your Art."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               I have scarce heard of any of these Stories that did not arise from a Love Intrigue—Amours raise as many Ghosts as Murders."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Mrs. Abigal endeavours to perswade us, that  it is your Ho—nour who troubles the House."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               That convinces me  it is a Cheat; for I think, Vellum, I may be pretty well assured it is not me."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               I am apt to think so truly. Ha—ha—ha!"
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               "
"                  Abigal had always an Ascendant over her Lady, and if there is a Trick in this Matter, depend upon it she is at the Bottom of it. I'll be hanged if this Ghost be not one of Abi-gal Familiars."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Mrs. Abigal has of late been very mysterious."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               I fancy, Vellum, thou could'st worm it out of her. I know formerly there was an Amour between you."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Mrs. Abigal hath her Allurements, and she knows I have picked up a Competency in your Ho—nour Service."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               If thou ha'st, all I ask of thee in return is, that thou would'st immediately renew thy Addresses to her. Coax her up. Thou hast such a Silver Tongue, Vellum, as it will be im-possible for her to withstand. Besides, she is so very a Wo-man, that she'll like thee the better for giving her the Pleasure of telling a Secret. In short, wheedle her out of it, and I shall act by the Advice which thou givest me."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Mrs. Abigal was never deaf to me, when I talked upon that Subject. I will take an Opportunity of addressing my self to her in the most pathetick Manner."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               In the mean time lock me up in your Office, and bring me word what Success you have—Well, sure I am the first that ever was employed to lay himself."
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               Vel."
"               You act indeed a threefold Part in this House; you are a Ghost, a Conjurer, and my Ho—noured Master Sir George Truman; he, he, he! You will pardon me for being jocular."
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"                Mr. Vellum, with all my Heart. You know I love you Men of Wit and Humour. Be as merry as thou pleasest, so thou do'st thy Business. [Mimicking him.]  You will remember, Vellum, your Commission is two-fold, first to gain Admission for me to your Lady, and secondly to get the Secret out of Abigal."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               It sufficeth."
"            "
"            The Scene shuts."
"            Enter Lady sola."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Women who have been happy in a first Marriage, are the most apt to venture upon a second. But for my part, I had a Husband so every way suited to my Inclinations, that I must entirely forget him, before I can like another Man. I have now been a Widow but fourteen Months, and have had twice as many Lovers, all of 'em profest Admirers of my Person, but passionately in love with my Jointure. I think it is a Revenge I owe my Sex to make an Example of this worthless Tribe of Fellows, who grow impudent, dress themselves fine, and fancy we are obliged to provide for 'em. But of all my Captives, Mr. Tinsel is the most extraordinary in his kind. I hope the Diversion I give my self with him is unblameable. I sure  it is necessary to turn my Thoughts off from the Memory of that dear Man, who has been the greatest Happiness and Affliction of my Life. My Heart would be a Prey to Melancholy, if I did not find these innocent Methods of relieving it. But here comes Abigal. I must teaze the Baggage, for I find she has taken it into her Head that I am entirely at her Disposal."
"            "
"            Enter Abigal."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab"
"               Madam! Madam! yonder Mr. Tinsel has as good as taken Possession of your House. Marry, he says, he must have Sir George Apartment enlarged; for truly, says he, I hate to be straitened. Nay, he was so impudent as to shew me the Chamber where he intends to consummate, as he calls it."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Well! he a wild Fellow."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Indeed he a very sad Man, Madam."
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               Lady."
"               He young, Abigal;  it is a thousand Pities he should be lost; I should be mighty glad to reform him."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Reform him! marry hang him!"

"               Ab."
"               Ay, enough to make your Heart ake."

"               I dare say thou think'st him a very agreeable Fellow."

"               Dost thou think he loves me?"

"               Madam, is your Ho—nour at Leisure to look into the Accounts of the last Week? They rise very high—House-keeping is chargeable in a House that is haunted."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               How comes that to pass? I hope the Drum neither eats nor drinks? But read your Account, Vellum."

"                  [putting on and off his Spectacles in this Scene]   A Hog-shead and a Half of Ale—it is not for the Ghost Drinking—But your Ho—nour Servants say they must have something to keep up their Courage against this strange Noise. They tell me they expect a double Quantity of Malt in their Small-Beer so long as the House continues in this Condition."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               At this rate they'll take care to be frightened all the Year round, I'll answer for 'em. But go on."

"               Sure no Woman in England has a Steward that makes such ingenious Comments on his Works. [Aside."

"               Lady."
"               For the Use of the Servants! What, are the Rogues a-fraid of sleeping in the Dark? What an unfortunate Woman am I! This is such a particular Distress, it puts me to my Wits End. Vellum, what woued you advise me to do?"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Madam, your Ho—nour has two Points to consider. Im-primis, To retrench these Extravagant Expences, which so many Strangers bring upon you.—Secondly, To clear the House of this Invisible Drummer"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               This learned Division leaves me just as wise as I was. But how must we bring these two Points to bear?"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               I beseech your Ho—nour to give me the hearing."

"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               I will be concise. There is a certain Person arrived this Morning, an aged Man of a venerable Aspect, and of a long hoary Beard, that reacheth down to his Girdle. The common People call him a Wizard, a White-Witch, a Conjurer, a Cunning-Man, a Necromancer, a—"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               No matter for his Titles. But what of all this?"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Give me the hearing, good my Lady! he pretends to great Skill in the Occult Sciences, and is come hither upon the rumor of this Drum. If one may believe him, he knows the Secret of laying Ghosts, or of quieting Houses that are haunted."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Pho, these are Idle Stories to amuse the Country Peo-ple, this can do us no good."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               It can do us no harm, my Lady."
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               Lady."
"               I dare say thou do'st not believe there is any thing in it thy self."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               I cannot say, I do; there is no danger however in the Experiment. Let him try his Skill; if it shoued succeed, we are rid of the Drum; if it shoued not, we may tell the World that it has, and by that means at least get out of this Expensive way of living; so that it must turn to your Advantage one way or ano-ther."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               I think you argue very rightly. But where is the Man? I would fain see him. He must be a Curiosity."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               I have already discoursed him, and he is to be with me, in my Office, half an Hour hence. He asks nothing for his Pains, till he has done his Work;—no Cure, no Mony."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               That Circumstance, I must confess, woued make one be-lieve there is more in his Art than one woued imagine. Pray Vel-lum go and fetch him hither immediately."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."

"               [Exeunt."
"            "
"            Enter Butler, Coachman, and Gardiner."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Rare News, my Lads, rare News!"
"            "
"            "
"               Gard."
"               What the Matter? hast thou got any more Vales for us?"
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               No,  it is better than that."
"            "
"            "
"               Coach."
"               Is there another Stranger come to the House?"
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Ay, such a Stranger as will make all our Lives easy."
"            "
"            "
"               Gard."
"               What! is he a Lord?"
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               A Lord! No, nothing like it,—He a Conjurer."
"            "
"            "
"               Coach."
"               A Conjurer! what, is he come a wooing to my Lady?"
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               No, no, you Fool, he come a purpose to lay the Spirit."
"            "
"            "
"               Coach."
"               Ay marry that good News indeed; But where is he?"
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               He locked up with the Steward in his Office, they are laying their Heads together very close. I fancy they are casting a Figure."
"            "
"            "
"               Gard."
"               Prithee John, what sort of a Creature is a Conjurer?"
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Why he made much as other Men are, if it was not for his long grey Beard."
"            "
"            "
"               Coach."
"               Look ye Peter, it stands with reason, that a Conjurer shoued have a long grey Beard—for did ye ever know a Witch that was not an Old Woman?"
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               Gard."
"               Why! I remember a Conjurer once at a Fayr, that to my thinking was a very Smock-faced Man, and yet he spewed out fifty Yards of green Ferret. I fancy, John, if thouedst get him into the Pantry and give him a Cup of Ale, heed shew us a few Tricks. Do'st think we coued not persuade him to swallow one of thy Case-Knives for his Diversion? He'll certainly bring it up again."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               "
"                  Peter! thou art such a Wise-acre! Thou do'st not know the Difference between a Conjurer and a Jugler. This Man must be a very great Master of his Trade. His Beard is at least half a Yard long, he dressed in a strange dark Cloak, as black as a Cole, your Conjurer always goes in Mourning."
"            "
"            "
"               Gard."
"               Is he a Gentleman, had he a Sword by his Side?"
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               No, no, he too grave a Man for that, a Conjurer is as grave as a Judge,—but he had a long white Wand in his Hand."
"            "
"            "
"               Coach."
"               You may be sure there a good deal of Vertue in that Wand—I fancy  it is made out of Witch Elm."
"            "
"            "
"               Gard."
"               I warrant you if the Ghost appears, he'll whisk ye that Wand before his Eyes, and strike you the Drum-stick out of his Hand."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               No; the Wand, look ye, is to make a Circle, and if he once gets the Ghost in a Circle, then he has him—let him get out again if he can. A Circle, you must know, is a Conjurer Trap."
"            "
"            "
"               Coach."
"               But what will he do with him, when he has him there?"
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Why then he'll overpower him with his Learning."
"            "
"            "
"               Gard."
"               If he can once compass him, and get him in Lobs-Pound, he'll make nothing of him, but speak a few hard Words to him, and perhaps bind him over to his good Behaviour, for a Thou-sand Years."
"            "
"            "
"               Coach."
"               Ay, ay, hell send him packing to his Grave again with a Flea in his Ear, I warrant him."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               No, no, I woued advise Madam to spare no Cost. If the Conjurer be but well paid, he'll take pains upon the Ghost, and lay him, look ye, in the Red-Sea—and then he laid for ever."
"            "
"            "
"               Coach."
"               Ay marry, that woued spoil his Drum for him."
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               Gard."
"               Why John, there must be a power of Spirits in that same Red-Sea—I warrant ye they are as plenty as Fish."
"            "
"            "
"               Coach."
"               Well, I wish after all that he may not be too hard for the Conjurer; I afraid he'll find a tough bit of work on "
"            "
"            "
"               Gard."
"               I wish the Spirit may not carry a Corner of the House off with him."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               As for that, Peter, you may be sure that the Steward has made his Bargain with the Cunning-Man beforehand, that he shall stand to all Costs, and Damages—But hark! yon-der Mrs. Abigal, we shall have her with us immediately, if we do not get off."
"            "
"            "
"               Gard."
"               Ay Lads! if we could get Mrs. Abigal well laid too—we should lead merry Lives."
"               For to a Man like me that Stout and Bold,"
"               A Ghost is not so dreadful as a Scold."
"            "

"            ACT III. SCENE I."
"            SCENE opens, and discovers Sir George in Vellum Office."
"            "
"               Sir "
"               I Wonder I don hear of Vellum yet. But I know his Wisdom will do nothing rashly. The Fellow has been so used to Form in Business, that it has infected his whole Conversation. But I must not find Fault with that punctual and exact Behaviour which has been of so much Use to me; my state is the better for it."
"               Enter Vellum."
"               "
"               Well Vellum, I impatient to hear your Success."

"            "

"               Sir "
"               Prithee let the Lock alone at present, and answer me."

"            "
"               Vel."
"               A fine taper Stick! It is well chosen. I will keep this till you are Sheriff of the County. It is not my custome to let any thing be lost."

"               Oh, Mr. Tinsel, I am glad to meet you here. I am going to give you an Entertainment, that won be disagreeable to a Man of Wit and Pleasure of the Town—There may be something diverting in a Conversation between a Conjurer, and this conceited Ass. [Aside."
"               "

"               Lady."
"               You must know here is a strange sort of a Man come to Town, who undertakes to free the House from this Disturbance. The Steward believes him a Conjurer."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Ay! thy Steward is a deep one!"

"               "

"            "
"               Tin."
"               Oh! I warrant you he has studyed the Black Art! Ha, ha, ha! Is not it an Oxford Scholar?—Widow, thy House is the most extraordinarily inhabited of any Widow this Day in Christendom.—I think thy four chief Domesticks are—a withered Abigal—a superannuated Steward,—a Ghost—and a Conjurer."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               "
"                  [Mimicking Tinsel]  And you woued have it inhabited by a Fifth, who is a more extraordinary Person than any of all these Four."

"                  [Aside, walking in a musing Posture]  That dear Woman! The Sight of her un-mans me. I coued weep for Tenderness, did not I, at the same time, feel an Indignation rise in me, to see that Wretch with her: And yet I cannot but smile to see her in the Company of her first and second Husband at the same time."

"               Tin."
"               ye hear that, Widow? The Stars have cut me out for thy Husband. This House is to have a Master, and that soon—Hark thee, old Gadbury, Is not Mars very like a young Fellow called Tom Tinsel?"

"            "
"               Lady."
"               And I am told that you can quiet them. I must confess I had a Curiosity to see the Person I had heard so much of; and, indeed, your Aspect shows that you have had much Experience in the World. You must be a very aged Man."

"            "
"               Sir "

"               Only a Compliment, Child, upon two or three of my Features. It does not become Me to repeat it."

"            THE PREFACE."
"            HAving recommended this Play to the Town, and delivered the Copy of it to the Bookseller, I think my self obliged to give some Account of it."
"            It had been some Years in the Hands of the Author, and falling under my Perusal, I thought so well of it that I persuaded him to make a few Additions and Alterations to it, and let it appear upon the Stage. I own I was very highly pleased with it, and liked it the better, for the want of those studyed Similes and Repartees, which we, who have writ before him, have thrown into our Plays, to indulge and gain upon a false Taste that has prevailed for many Years in the British Theatre. I believe the Au-thor would have fallen into this Way a little more than he has, had he, before the writing of it, been often present at Theatrical Representations, and observed the Effect that such Ornaments generally have upon the Town. I was confirmed in my Thoughts of the Play, by the Opi-nion of better Judges to whom it was Communicated, who observed that the Scenes were written very much after Moliere Manner, and that an easie and natural Vein of Humour ran through the whole."

"               We shall have much Issue."
"               [Exeunt."
"            "
"         "
"         "
"            "
"            ACT  SCENE I."
"            Enter Vellum and Butler."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               "
"                  JOHN, I have certain Orders to give you—and there-fore be attentive."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Attentive! Ay, let me alone for that.—I suppose he means being Sober. [Aside."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               You know I have always recommended to you a Method in your Business, I woued have your Knives and Forks, your Spoons and Napkins, your Plate and Glasses, laid in a Method."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Ah, Master Vellum, you are such a sweet-spoken Man, it does one Heart good to receive your Orders."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Method, John, makes Business easie, it banishes all Per-plexity and Confusion out of Families."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               How he talks! I coued hear him all Day."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               And now John, let me know whether your Table-lin-nen, your Side-Board, your Cellar, and every thing else within your Province, are properly and methodically disposed for an En-tertainment this Evening."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Master Vellum, they shall be ready at a quarter of an hour Warning. But pray Sir, is this Entertainment to be made for the Conjurer?"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               It is, John, for the Conjurer, and yet it is not for the Conjurer."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Why, look you Master Vellum, if it is for the Conjurer, the Cook-Maid shoued have Orders to get him some Dishes to his Palate. Perhaps he may like a little Brimstone in his Sauce."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               This Conjurer, John, is a complicated Creature, an Am-phibious Animal, a Person of a Two-fold Nature—But he eats and drinks like other Men."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Marry, Master Vellum, he shoued eat and drink as much as two other Men, by the Account you give of him."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Thy Conceit is not amiss, he is indeed a double Man, ha, ha, ha!"
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Ha! I understand you, He one of your Hermaphrodites, as they call 'em."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               He is Married, and he is not Married—He hath a Beard, and he hath no Beard. He is Old, and he is Young."
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               But."
"               How charmingly he talks! I fancy, Master Vellum, you coued make a Riddle. The same Man Old and Young! How do you make that out, Master Vellum?"
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Thou hast heard of a Snake casting his Skin, and reco-vering his Youth. Such is this Sage Person."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Nay  it is no wonder a Conjurer shoued be like a Serpent."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               When he has thrown aside the old Conjurer Slough that hangs about him, he'll come out as fine a young Gentleman as ever was seen in this House."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Does he intend to sup in his Slough?"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               That Time will show."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Well, I have not a Head for these things. Indeed, Mr. Vellum, I have not understood one Word you have said this half Hour."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               I did not intend thou shouedst—But to our Business—Let there be a Table spread in the Great-Hall. Let your Pots and Glasses be washed, and in a Readiness. Bid the Cook provide a plentiful Supper, and see that all the Servants be in their best Liveries."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Ay! now I understand every Word you say. But I woued rather hear you talk a little in that other Way."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               I shall explain to thee what I have said by and by—Bid Susan lay two Pillows upon your Lady Bed."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Two Pillows! Madam won sleep upon 'em both! She is not a double Woman too?"
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               She will sleep upon neither. But hark, Mrs. Abigal, I think I hear her chiding the Cook-Maid."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Then I'll away, or it will be my Turn next; She, I am sure, speaks plain English, one may easily understand every Word She says."
"               [Exit Butler."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Vellum Solus."
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Servants are good for nothing, unless they have an Opi-nion of the Person Understanding who has the Direction of them.—But see Mrs. Abigal! she has a bewitching Counte-nance, I wish I may not be tempted to marry her in good Earnest."
"            "
"            Enter Abigal"
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Ha! Mr. Vellum."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Vel"
"               What brings my Sweet one hither?"
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               Ab."
"               I am coming to speak to my Friend behind the Wainscot. It is fit, Child, he shoued have an Account of this Conjurer, that he may not be surprized."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               That woued be as much as thy thousand Pound is worth."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               I'll speak low—Walls have Ears. [Pointing at the Wainscot."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               But heark you Ducklin! be sure you do not tell him that I am let into the Secret."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               That a good one indeed! as if I shoued ever tell what passes between you and me."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               No, no, my Child, that must not be; he, he, he! that must not be; he, he, he!"
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               You will always be waggish."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Adieu, and let me hear the result of your Conference."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               How can you leave one so soon? I shall think it an Age till I see you again."
"            "
"            "
"               Vel."
"               Adieu my pretty one."

"               I have him—if I can but get this Thousand Pound."
"               [Fantome gives three Raps upon his Drum behind the Wainscot."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Ha. Three Raps upon the Drum! the Signal Mr. Fantome and I agreed upon, when he had a mind to speak with me."
"               [Fantome raps again."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Very well, I hear you; come Fox, come out of your Hole."
"            "
"            "
"               Scene opens, and Fantome comes out."
"            "
"               Ab."
"               You may leave your Drum in the Ward-robe, till you have Occasion for it."
"            "
"            "
"               Fan."
"               Well, Mrs. Abigal, I want to hear what is a doing in the World."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               You are a very inquisitive Spirit. But I must tell you, if you do not take care of your self, you will be Laid this Evening."
"            "
"            "
"               Fan."
"               I have overheard something of that Matter. But let me alone for the Doctor—I'll engage to give a good Account of"
"Him. I am more in pain about Tinsel. When a Lady in the Case, I more afraid of one Fop than twenty Conjurers."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               To tell you truly, he presses his Attacks with so much Impudence, that he has made more Progress with my Lady in two Days, than you did in two Months."
"            "
"            "
"               Fan."
"               I shall attack her in another manner, if thou canst but procure me another Interview. There nothing makes a Lover so keen, as being kept up in the Dark."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Pray no more of your distant Bows, your respectful Com-pliments—Realy, Mr. Fantome, you're only fit to make Love a-cross a Tea-Table."
"            "
"            "
"               Fan."
"               My dear Girl, I can forbear hugging thee for thy good Advice."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Ay, now I have some Hopes of you; but why don you do so to my Lady?"
"            "
"            "
"               Fan."
"               Child, I always thought your Lady loved to be treated with Respect."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Believe me, Mr. Fantome, there is not so great a diffe-rence between Woman and Woman, as you imagine. You see Tinsel has nothing but his Sauciness to recommend him."
"            "
"            "
"               Fan."
"               "
"                  Tinsel is too great a Coxcomb to be capable of Love—And let me tell thee, Abigal, a Man, who is sincere in his Pas-sion, makes but a very awkard Profession of it—But I'll mend my Manners."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Ay, or you'll never gain a Widow—Come, I must tutor you a little; suppose me to be my Lady, and let me see how you'll behave your self."
"            "
"            "
"               Fan."
"               I afraid, Child, we han time for such a piece of Mummery."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Oh, it will be quickly over, if you play your Part well."
"            "
"            "
"               Fan."
"               Why then, dear Mrs. Ab—I mean my Lady Tru-man."
"               "
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               Ay! but you han saluted me."
"            "
"            "
"               Fan."
"               That right; Faith I forgot that Circumstance. [Kisses her.]  "
"                  Nectar and Ambrosia!"

"               How long must I be condemned to languish! when shall my Sufferings have an end! My Life! my Happiness, my All is wound up in you—"
"            "
"            "
"               "

"               Well! why don you squeeze my Hand?"

"               What, thus?"

"            "
"               Ab."
"               Thus? Ay—Now throw your Arm about my Middle; Hug me closer.—You are not afraid of hurting me! Now pour forth a Volley of Rapture and Nonsense, till you are out of Breath."

"               Ay, this is talking like a Lover. though  I only represent my Lady, I take a Pleasure in hearing you. Well,  my Con-science when a Man of Sense has a little Dash of the Coxcomb in him, no Woman can resist him. Go on at this rate, and the thousand Pound is as good as in my Pocket."

"               I shall think it an Age till I have an Opportunity of put-ting this Lesson in Practice."

"               Ab."
"               You may do it soon, if you make good Use of your Time; Mr. Tinsel will be here with my Lady at Eight, and at Nine the Conjurer is to take you in Hand."

"            "
"               Tin."
"               Why look ye, Ied sell the Caudle-Cup with the old Saint for as much Money as theyed fetch, which I woued con-vert into a Diamond Buckle, and make you a Present of it."

"               Oh you are generous to an Extravagance. But pray, Mr. Tinsel, don dispose of my Goods before you are sure of my Person. I find you have taken a great Affection to my Moveables."

"            "
"               Tin."
"               Pho, pho, my Dear, we are growing Serious; and, let me tell you, that the very next Step to being Dull. Come, that pretty Face was never made to look grave with."

"            "
"               Lady."

"            "
"               Tin."
"               For that very Reason, my Dear, let us get over it as fast as we can."

"               I should be very much in haste for a Husband, if I married within fourteen Months after Sir George Decease."

"            "
"               Tin."
"               Pray, my Dear, let me ask you a Question; Do'st not thou think that Sir George is as dead at present, to all Intents and Purposes, as he will be a Twelve-month hence?"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Yes, but Decency! Mr. Tinsel—"

"            "
"               Tin."
"               Or do'st thou think thou'lt be more a Widow then, than thou art now?"

"               Tin."
"               Ah, my Dear, they woued say you loved your Second; and they woued own I deserved it, for I shall love thee most in-ordinately."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."

"               "
"               Tin."
"               Think! why they woued think thee the Mirrour of Wi-dowhood.—That a Woman shoued live fourteen whole Months after the Decease of her Spouse, without having engaged herself. Why, about Town, we know many a Woman of Quality Se-cond Husband several Years before the Death of the First."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Ay, I know you Wits have your common-place Jests upon us poor Widows."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               I'll tell you a Story, Widow; I know a certain Lady, who considering the Craziness of her Husband, had, in case of Mortality, engaged her self to two young Fellows of my Acquaintance. They grew such desperate Rivals for her, while her Husband was alive, that one of them pinked the other in a Duel. But the good Lady was no sooner a Widow, but what did my Dowager do? Why faith, being a Woman of Honour, she married a Third, to whom, it seems, she had gi-ven her first Promise."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               And this is a true Story upon your own Knowledge?"

"            "
"               Tin."
"               Every Tittle, as I hope to be marryed, or never believe Tom Tinsel."

"            "
"               Lady."
"               Pray, Mr. Tinsel, do you call this talking like a Wit, or like a Rake?"
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Innocent enough, he, he, he! Why! where the Dif-ference, my Dear?"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Yes, Mr. Tinsel, the only Man I ever loved in my Life, had a great deal of the one, and nothing of the other in him."
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Nay now you grow vapourish; thou'lt begin to fancy thou hear'st the Drum by and by."
"            "
"            "

"               If you had been here last Night about this time, you would not have been so merry."

"            "
"               Tin."
"               About this time, say'st thou? Come faith, for the Hu-mour sake, we'll sit down and listen."

"            "

"            "
"               Tin."
"               Serious! never fear me, Child. Ha, ha, ha! Do'st not hear him?"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               You break your World already. Pray, Mr. Tinsel, do you laugh to show your Wit or your Teeth?"
"            "
"            "
"               Tin."
"               Why, both! my Dear.—I glad, however, that she has taken notice of my Teeth. [Aside.]  But you look serious, Child; I fancy thou hear'st the Drum, do'st not?"

[Drum beats.]  Hark! hark! what Noise is that! Heaven defend us! this is more than Fancy."

I don question but I shall make his Reverence scamper as fast as the Lover. And then the Day my own. But the Servants are coming. I must get into my Cup-board."

"               Oh my poor Lady! This wicked Drum has frighted Mr. Tinsel out of his Wits, and my Lady into a Swoon. Let me bend her a little forward. She revives. Here, carry her into the fresh Air and she'll recover. [They carry her off.]  This is a little barbarous to my Lady, but  it is all for her Good: and I know her so well, that she woued not be angry with me, if she knew what I was to get by it. And if any of her Friends shoued blame me for it hereafter,"

There must be abundance of Business done in the Family at this rate. But here comes the Triple-Alliance. Who coued have thought these three Rogues coued have found each of 'em an Employment in fetching a Pen and Ink!"

"               I can as yet see no hurt in my Wife Behaviour; but still have some certain Pangs and Doubts, that are natu-ral to the Heart of a fond Man. I must take the Advan-tage of my Disguise to be thoroughly satisfied. It woued neither be for her Happiness, nor mine, to make my self known to her till I am so [Aside.]  Dear Vellum! I am im-patient to hear some News of my Wife, how does she af-ter her Fright?"
"            "

"               Sir "

"               "
"               Sir "
"               This is Whimsical enough! my Wife will have a quick Succession of Lovers, in one Day—Fantome has driven out Tinsel, and I shall drive out Fantome."

I must have Satisfaction of this Traitour Fantome; and cannot take a more proper one, than by turning him out of my House, in a manner that shall throw Shame upon him, and make him ridiculous as long as he lives.—You must remember, Vellum, you have abundance of Business upon your Hands, and I have but just time to tell it you over, all I require of you is Dispatch, there-fore hear me."

"            "
"               Sir "
"               There is no bearing this! Thou art a going to describe Dispatch, when thou shouldst be practising it."

"               In the First place, you are to lay my Wigg, Hat, and Sword ready for me in the Closet, and one of my Scarlet Coats. You know how Abigal has described the Ghost to you."
"            "
"            "

"               Then you must remember, whilst I am laying this Ghost, you are to prepare my Wife for the Reception of her real Husband; tell her the whole Story, and do it with all the Art you are Master of, that the Surprise may not be too great for her."

"            "
"               Sir "
"               I shall expect her impatiently. For now I can talk to her without being interrupted by that impertinent Rogue Tin-sel. I hope thou hast not told Abigal any thing of the Secret."

But I must take care of indulging this Tenderness, and put on a Behaviour more suitable to my present Character."

"               "
"                  [to Vellum.]  This is surprizing indeed! So all the Ser-vants tell me; They say he knows every thing that has happened in the Family."
"            "
"            "
"               Ab."
"               "

"            "
"               Sir "
"               Speak! But hold—first let me feel your Pulse?"

"            "
"               Lady."
"               What can you learn from that?"
"            "
"            "
"               Sir "
"               I have already learned a Secret from it, that will asto-nish you."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."

"               "
"                  [Aside.]  I glad to hear that—He must mean Mr. Fan-tome; I begin to think there a good deal of Truth in his Art."
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Alas! I fear you mean I shall see Sir George Appa-rition a second time."

"               "
"               Sir "

"            "
"               Ab."

"            "
"               Sir G"
"               As well as I do my self—I saw him with you in the red Damask Room, when he first made Love to you; your Mother left you together, under Pretence of receiving a Visit from Mrs. Hawthorn, on her Return from London."
"               "
"            "
"            "

"               Sir "
"               You were a great Admirer of a single Life for the first half Hour; your Refusals then grew still fainter and fainter. With what Extasy did Sir George kiss your Hand, when you told him you shoued always follow the Advice of your Mamma!"
"               "
"            "
"            "

"            "
"               Sir "
"               Then, Lady! the Wedding Night! I saw you in your white Sattin Night-gown; you woued not come out of your Dressing-Room, till Sir George took you out by Force. He drew you gently by the Hand—You struggled—but he was too strong for you—You blushed, He—"
"            "
"            "
"               Lady."
"               Oh! stop there! go no farther!—He knows every thing. [Aside."

"                  [to Lady.] My Dear, I long as much to tell you my whole Story, as you do to hear it. In the mean while, I am to look upon this as my Wedding Day. I'll have nothing but the Voice of Mirth and Feasting in my House. My poor Neigh-bours and my Servants shall rejoyce with me. My Hall shall be free to every one, and let my Cellars be thrown open."

"               It a very hard thing to be a Butler in a House, that is disturbed. He made such a Racket in the Cellar last Night, that I afraid he'll sower all the Beer in my Barrels."

I durst not go up into the Cock-Loft this Morning, if I had not got one of the Maids to go along with me."

"               Out of all manner of Question, Robin,  it is Sir George. Mrs. Abigal is of Opinion it can be none but his Honour; he always loved the Wars, and you know was mightily pleased from a Child with the Musick of a Drum."

"                it is Master as sure as I stand here alive, and I verily believe I saw him last Night in the Town-Close."

"               Pho, Robin, I tell ye he has never appeared yet but in the Shape of the Sound of a Drum,"
"            "
"            "
"               Coach."
"               This makes one almost afraid of one own Shadow. As I was walking from the Stable other Night without my Lan-thorn, I fell a-cross a Beam, that lay in my way, and Faith my Heart was in my Mouth—I thought I had stumbled over a Spirit."
"            "
"            "
"               But."
"               Thou might'st as well have stumbled over a Straw; why, a Spirit is such a little little Thing, that I have heard a Man, who was a great Scholar, say, that he'll dance ye a Lancashire Horn-Pipe upon the point of a Needle—As I sat in the Pantry last Night counting my Spoons, the Candle methought burnt blue, and the spayed Bitch looked as if she saw something."
