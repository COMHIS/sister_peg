"Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God."
"Yc HE High and Lofty One who ST inhabiteth eternity, dwelleth also I'"
"J;.'*wzvith him that is of' humble and contrite heart. Iri the midst of his glory, the Almighty is not inattentive to the meanest of his fubjeas. Neither obscurity of flation, nor imperfection of knowledge, sinks those below his  regard, who worship and obey him. Every Sprayer which they fend up from their fe.ret retirements, is lifteoed to by him; and every work of charity which they perform, how unknown soever to the world, attracts his notice. The Text presents a signal instance of this comfortable truth."
"In the city of Caesarea, there dwelt a Roman centurion, a military officer of inferiour rank, a Gentile, neither by birth nor religion entitled to the privileges of the Jewish nation. But he was a devout and a benevolent man; who, according to his measure of religious knowledge, fludied to perform his duty, prayed to God always, and gave much alms to the people. Such a character passed not unobserved by God. So highly was it honoured, that to this good centurion an Angel was sent from heaven, in order to dire him to the means of full-ipftruction in the truth, The Angel accosts him with this salutation, Cornelius, Thy prayqrs and thine alms are come up for a memorial bo3re Qod."
"It is to the conjuncion of prayers and alms, that I purpose now to direct your thoughts, as describing the refpeaable and amiable charaaer of a man, as forming the honour and the blessedness of a true Chriflian; piety joined with charity, faith with good works, devotion with morality. These are things which God hath conneded, and which it is impious in man to separate. It is only when they remain united, that they can come up as a grateful memorial before God. I shall first endeavour to thew you, That alms with out prayers, or prayers without alms, morality without devotion, or devotion without morality, are extremely defeCive ; and then shall point out the happy effects of their mutual union."
"LET us begin with considering the cafe of alms without prayers; that is, of good works without piety, or a proper sense of God and Religion. Examples of this are nor uncommon in the world. With many, Virtue is, or at least is pretended to be, a refpeaable and an honoured -.- name, while Piety founds meanly in their ears. They are men of the world, and they claim to be men of honour. They reft upon their humanity,' their publick spirit, their probity, and their truth."
"They arrogate to themselves all the manly and the aaive virtues. But devout affections, and religious duties, they treat with contempt, as founded on shadowy fpeculations, and fit to employ the attention only of weak and superstitious minds."
"Now, in opposition to such persons, I contend, That this neglea of piety argues depravity of heart; and that it infers an irregular discharge of the duties of morality."
"FIRST, It argues internal depravity; for it discovers -a cold and a hard heart."
"If there be any impression which man is'"
"formed by nature to receive, it is a sense of religion. As soon as his mind opens to observation and refletion, he discerns innumerable marks of his dependent slate."
"He finds himself placed, by some superiour power, in a vast world, where the wisdom and goodness of the Creator are conspicuous on every  The magnificence, the beauty and order of nature, excite him to admire and adore. When he looks up to that omnipotent hand which operates throughout the universe, he is impressed with reverence. When he receives blessings which he cannot avoid ascribing to divine goodness, he is prompted to gratitude. The expressions of those affections under the various forms of religious worship, are no other than native effufions of the human heart. Ig-4 norance may mislead, and superstition may corrupt them; but their origin is derived from sentiments that are essential to man."
"Cast your eyes over the whole earth."
"Explore the most remote quarters of the east or the weft. You may discover tribes, of men, without policy, or laws, or cities,."
"or any of the arts of life: But no where will you find them without some form of religion. In every region you behold the SE  prostrate worshipper, the temple, the al-- tar, and the offering. Wherever men have existed, they have been sensible that some acknowledgment was due, on their part, to the Sovereign of the world. If in their rudest and most ignorant state, this obligation has been felt, what additional force must it acquire by the improvements of human knowledge, but especially by the great discoveries of the Christian revelation ? Whatever, either from reverence or from gratitude, can excite men to the worship of God, is by this revelation placed in such a light, as one should think were fufficient to over-awe the most thoughtless, and to melt the most obdurate mind."
"Canst thou, then, pretend to be a man of reason, nay, a man of virtue, and yet continue regardless of one of the first and chief dictates of human nature ? Where is thy sensibility to what is right and fit, if that loud voice which calls all nations throughout the earth to religious homage, has never been heard by thee ? Or, if it , been heard, by what strange and false ) "
"refinements haft thou stifled those natural sentiments which it tends to awaken ?"
"Calling thyself a son, a citizen, a friend I claiming to be faithful and affectionate in these telations; haft thou no sense of what thou oweft to thy first Parent, thy highest Sovereign, thy greatest Benefactor ? Can it be consistent with true virtue bt honour, to value thyself upon thy regard to inferiour obligationsi and- yet to violate that which is the moss facted and the most ancient of all ? When simple inftin& teaches the Tartar and the Indian, together with his alms and good works to join his prayers to that Power whom he considers as the source of good, shall it be no reproach, in thb most enlightened flats of human nature, and under the puteft dispensation of religion, to have extinguifhed the sense of gratitude to Heaven, and to flight all acknowledgment of the great and the true God? What does such condut& imply, but either an entire want, or a wilful fupprefioo, of some of the best  and most generous affetions belonging to - human nature ?-Surely, there muff be an essential defect in that heart which remains cold and insensible, where it ought to be affeaed most warmly. Surely, such a degree of depravity must be lodged there, as is fufficient to taint all the other springs of pretended virtue. '"
"BUT besides this, I must contend, in the second place, That where religion is negleded, there can be no regular nor steady pracice of the duties of morality, The characer will be often inconsistent; and Virtue placed on a basis too narrow to support it, will be always loose and tottering. For such is the propensity of our nature to vice, so numerous are the temptations to a relaxed and immoral condudt, that fironger restraints than those of mere reason, are necessary to be imposed 'on man. The sense of right and wrong, the principle of honour, or the inflina of benevolence, are barriers too feeble to withstand the strength of paffioq."
"In the tranquil seasons of life, these natu- sE "
"ral principles may, perhaps, carry on the _ ordinary course of social duties with some regularity. But wait until some trying emergence come. Let the conflit oý passions arise. Let 'the heart be either wounded by fore distress, or agitated by violent emotions; and you shall presently fee, that virtue without religion is inadequate to the government of life. It is deftitute of its proper guard, of its firmest support, of its chief encouragement. It will fink under the weight of misfortune; or will yield to the solicitation of guilt."
"* The great motives that produce conflancy and firmness of a6ion, must be of a palpable and firiking kind. A divine Legiflator, uttering his voice from heaven; an omnifpient Witness, beholding us in all our retreats; an almighty Governour, stretching forth his arm to punish or reward, disclosing the secrets of the invisible world, informing us of perpetual reft prepared hereafter for the righteous, and of indignation and wrath awaiting the wicked:"
"SE  There are the considerations which overs awe the world, which support integrity, "
"and check guilt. They add to virtue that solemnity which should ever charadterize it. To the admonitions of confcienee they give the authority of a law. Co-operating with all the good dispositions of a pious man, they strengthen and insure their influence. On his alms you can have nb certain dependance, who thinks not of God, nor has joined prayer to his charitable deeds. But when humanity is feconded by piety, the spring from which it flows is rendered, of course, more regular and conflant.-In short, withdraw religion, and you shake all the pillars of morality. In every heart you weakert the influence of virtue: And among the multitude, the bulk of maDkind, you overthrow its power."
"HA VING thus shewn that morality without devotion is both defecive and unflable, I proceed to confider the other extreme, of prayers without almsl devotion without morality."
"In every age the pratice has prevailed, "
"of substituting certain appearances of piety I."
"in the place of the great duties of humanity and mercy. Too many there have always been, who flatter themselves with the hope of obtaining the friendship of their Creator, though they negled to do juffice to their fellow-creatures. But such persons may be assured, that their supposed piety is altogether of a spurious, kind. It is an invention of their own, unknown to reason, unknown in the word of God. Int scripture we are ever directed to try our faith by our works, our love of God by our love of men. We are direCed to confider piety as a principle which regenerates the heart, and forms it to goodness. We are taught, that in vain we address any ads of homage to Christ, unless we do the things which he faith ; and that love, peace, gentlenefs, goodness, meekness and temperance are not only the injundions of his law, but the native fruits of his spirit *. If, there * Luke  46. GaL  22."
"fore, while piety seems ardent, morality I Sfhall decline, you have full reason to be lieve, that into that piety some corrupting ingredients have entered. And if ever your regard to morality shall totally fail; if, while you make many prayers, you give no alms; if, while you appear to be zealous for God, your are false or unjust to men; if you are hard or contraced in heart, severe in your censures, and oppreffive in your condut;. then, conclude with certainty, that what you had termed piety was no more than an empty name. For as soon, according to the scripture fimilitude, will bitter waters flow from afweet fountain, as such effecs be produced by genuine piety."
"What you have called by that name, "
"resolves itself into one or other of three things. Either it is a hypocritical form of godliness, assumed in order to impose on the world; or, which is the most favourable supposition, it is a transient impreflion of seriousness, an accidental melting of the heart, which passes away like the morning cloud and the early dew; or, "
"which I am afraid is too often the cafe, -"
"it is the deliberate refuge of a deluded and superstitious, but at the fame time a corrupted mind. For all men, even the most depraved, are fubjea, more or less, to compunaions of conscience. It has never been in their power to withdraw totally beyond the reach of that warning voice, which tells them that something is necessary to be done, in order to make their peace with the Ruler of the world."
"But, backward at the fame time to resign the gains of dishonesty, or the pleasures of vice; averse from submission to that sacred law which enjoins righteousness in its whole extent, they have often attempted to make a fort of composition with Heaven; a composition, which, though they dare not avow it in words, lurks in secret at the bottom of many a heart. If God will only dispense with some articles of obedience, they will repay him with abundant homage. If they fail in good praaice, they will fludy to  be found in belief; and, by the number of their prayers, will ;tone, in some measure, "
"for their deficiency in charitable deeds."
"But the attempt is as vain, as it is im pious. From the simplest and plainest principles of reason it must appear, that religious worlhip, disjoined from justice and virtue, can upon no account whatever find acceptance with the Supreme Being. To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me ? faith the Lord."
"Bring no more vain oblations. Incense is an abomination unto me. The new moons and fabbaths, the calling of ajjmblies, I cannot away with ; it is iniquity, even the solemn meetings *.- Cease, foolifl and impious man! Cease to confider the Almighty as a weak or vain-glorious being, who is to be appeased by thy devout proftrations, and thy humble words; or to be gratified by the parade and ostentation of external worihip. What is all thy worship to him?"
"Will be eat the flejh of thy sacrifices, or drink the blqod of ofered goats ? Was worship required of thee, dost thou think, upon his account, that thou mighteft --"
"bring any increase to his glory and felicity by thy weak and insignificant praises ?"
"Sooner mighteft thou increase the fplendour of the fun by a lighted taper, or add to the thunder by thy voice. No: It is for the fake of man, not of God, that wor(hip and prayers are required; not that Go4 may be rendered more glorious, but that man may be made better ; that he may be confirmed in a proper sense of his "
"pendent slate, and acquire those pious and virtuous dispositions in which his highelf jiproveqent consists."
"Of all the principles in religion, one thould take this to be the most evident; and yet frequent admonitions are needed, to renew the impression of it upon mankind. For what purpose did thy Creator place thee in this world, in the midst of human society, but that as a man among ,men thou mightqft cultivate humanity; <bat each in his place might contribute to the general welfare; that as a spouse, a  brother, a son, or a friend, thou mighteft -- a thy part with an upright and a tender heart; and thus aspire to resemble Him who ever consults the good of his creatures, and whose tender mercies are over all his works ? And dareft thou, who haft been sacrificing unfufpicious innocence to thy loose pleasures; thou, who haft been disturbing the repose of society by thine ambition or craft; thou, who, to increase thy treasures, haft been making the widow and the orphan weep; dareft thou approach God with thy worship and thy prayers, and entertain the hope that he will look down upon thee in peace ? Will the God of order and justice accept such poor compensation for his violated laws ?"
"Will the God of love regard the services of one who is an enemy to his creatures ?"
"Shall a corrupter of the society of men aspire to the habitations of pure and bleffed spirits ?-Believe it, He that faith he loveth God, mufi love his brother also. Cease to do evil; learn to do well. . Seek judgment ; relieve the opprefed, judge the fa "
"thArlefs, plead for the widow: And then; Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh '"
"to thee; call upon him in the day of trouble, and he will answer thee. Thy prayers and thine alms shall then ascend, in joint memorial, before the Most High; I HAVE now shown the evil of niaim and splitting religion; of dividing asunder two .things, which though in theory they may be separated, yet in praaice muff always co-exist if either of them be real, Devotion to God, and Charity to men. Let us confider next the happy effeas of their union."
"Their union forms the confiflent, the graceful, the refpedable characer of the real Chriftlan, the man of true worth."
"If you leave either of them out of your system, even though you excel irn the other, you can fland trial only in one point of view. It is only on one your charaaer is fair; on the other, it will always be open to much reproach."
"And as you dilhonour yourselves, so you SE RM do great injustice to xeligion. For, by -- dividing its parts fiom one another, you never fail to expose it to the cenfur6 of the world: And perhaps, by this fort of partial and divided goodness, religion has fuffered more the esteem of inankindd than by open profligacy. The unbeliever will fcoff at yout piety, ,when he fees you negligent of moral duties. The bigot will decry all morality, when he fees you pretending to be a follower of virtue, though you be a despiser of God. Whereas he who fears God, and is at the fame -time jilft and beneficent to men, exhibits religion to the world wirh full propriety. It Ih'ines in his-condua with its native fplendour ; and its rays throw a glory round .him. His charater is above reproach."
"It is at once amiablehand 'venerable. Malice itself is afraid 'to attack him; and even the worst men refpe iand honour him in their hearts.

- This too is the -man whose life will be tnoft peaceful and happy. He who fails materially either in piety or in virtue, is Aalway obnoxious to the anguilh of remorse. His partial goodnqfs may flatter kia in tbe day of fupqrficial observation ; but when solitude or distress awakens the powers  refletion, he hall be made to feel, that oile part ps duty performed, atones not for another which is neglected.
In the midst of his prayers, the remem,brance of injustice will upbraid him with bypocrify: and in the distribution of his alms, the prayers which the poor put up for him, will make him blush for his neglea of God. Conscience will supply the place of the hand coming forth to write over against him on the wall, Thou art *weighed in the balance, and art found wanting *. Whereas he who holds both faith and a good conscience, who attends equally .to'the discharge of his duty towards God and towards'man, enjoys, as far as hu.man imperfetion allows, the sense of .fairnfs and confiftenoy in condut, of integrity and soundness of heart."
"The man of mere morality, is a stranger -to all the delicate.and. refined pleasures of devotion. In works of beneficence and . mercy, he may enjoy fatisfa6ion. But his fatisfa6tion is deflitute of that glow of affection, which enlivens the feelings of one who lifts his heart at the fame time to the Father of the universe, and confiders himself as imitating God. The man again who rests solely on devotion, if that devotion open not his heart to humanity, not only remains a firanger to the pleafures of beneficence, but must often undergo the pain arising from bad passions."
"But when beneficence and devotion are united, they pour upon the man in whom they meet, the full pleasures of a good and pure heart. His alms conneaed him with men; his prayers with God. He looks without dismay on both worlds."
"All nature has to him a benign afpe&."
"If engaged in a&ive life, he is the friend of men; and he is happy in the exertions of that friendship. If left in retirement, he walks among the works of nature, as with God. Every obje& is enlivened to him by the sense of the Divine presence. Every where he traces the beneficent hand of the Author of nature; and every where, with glowing heart, he hears and answers his secret voice."
"When he looks up to heaven, he rejoices in the thought that there dwells that God whom he serves and honours; that Saviour in whom he trusts; that Spirit of grace from whose inspiration his piety and his charity flow. When he looks around him on the world, he is soothed with the pleasing remembrance of good offices which he has done, or at least has fludied to do, to many who dwell there. How comfortable the refleaion, that him no poor man can upbraid for having with-held his due; him no unfortunate man can reproach for having seen and despised his sorrows; but that on his head are descending the prayers of the needy and the aged; and that the hands of those whom his proteaion has supported, or his bounty has fed, are lifted up in secret to bless him!"
"Life passed under the influence of such ifpofitions, naturally leads to a happy ERM. end. It is not enough to fay; that faith . and piety, joined with ative virtue, c6n flitute the requisite preparation for heaven. They in truth begin the enjoyment of heaven. In every slate of our existence, they form the chief ingredients of felicity."
"Hence they are the great marks of Chri-."
"flian regeneration. They are the fignature of that Holy Spirit, by which good men are said to be sealed unto the day of redemption.-The Text affords a firiking proof of the estimation in which they are held by God.

He remarked the. amiable dispositions which rose in the heart of this good man. But he saw that they were yet imperfea, while he remained unenlightened by the principles of the Christian religion.

# SERMON  On the Influence of Religion upon Adversity.

## PSAL. xxvii. 5. In the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion; in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.



On the Influence of RELIGION upon In the time of trouble, he Jhall hide me in his pavilion; in the secret of his tabernacle Jhall he hide me ; he Jhall jet me up upon a rock.

THE life of man has always been a very mixed slate, full of uncertain- IL ty and vicissitude, of anxieties and fears.
In every religious audience, there are many who fall under the denomination of the unfortunate; and the reft are ignorant how soon they may be called to join them. For the prosperity of no man pn earth is stable and assured. Dark  clouds may soon gather over the heads of , those whose sky is now most bright. In the midst of the deceitful calm which they enjoy, .the storm that is to overwhelm them has perhaps already begun to ferment. If a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness, for they Jfall be many *.

Hence, to a thoughtful mind, no study can appear more important, than how to be suitably prepared for the misfortunes of life; so as to contemplate them in prospeC without dismay, and, if they muff befal, to bear them without dejedion.
Throughout every age, the wisdom of the wife, the treasures of the rich, and the power of the mighty, have been employed, either in guarding their slate against the approach of distress, or in rendering themselves less vulnerable by its attacks.
Power has endeavoured to remove adverfity to a distance. Philosophy has studied, when it drew nigh, to conquer it by patience; and Wealth has fought out every pleasure that cad compensate or alleviate pain.

While the wisdom of the world is thus occupied, religion has been no less atterttive to the fame 'important objea. It inforihs us In the Text, of a pavilion which God ereds to shelter his servants in the time of trofble, of afecretplace in his tabernacle into which he brings them, of a rock on which he sets them up; and elsewhere he tells us, of a hield and a buckler which he spreads before them, to cover thetnfrom the terrour by night, and the arrow that flieth by day. Now, of what nature are those instruments of defence, which God is represented as providing with such solicitous care for those who fear him? Has he reared up any bulwarks, impregnable by misfortune, in order to separate the pious and virtuous from the reft of mankind, and to screen them from the common disasters of life ?
No: To those disasters we behold them liable no less than others. The defence which religion provides, is altogether of ER aM. an internal kind. It is the heart, not the outward slate, which it profeffes to guard.

When the time of trouble comes, as come it must to all, it places good men under the pavilion of the Almighty, by affording them that security and peace which arise from the belief of divine proteaion, It brings them into thefecret of his tabernacle, by opening to them sources of confolation which are hidden from others, .By that flrength of mind with which it endows them, it Jets them up upon a rock, against which the tempest may violently beat, but which it cannot thake.

How far the comforts proceeding from religion merit those high titles under which they are here figuratively defcribed, I shall in this discourse endeavour to show. I shall for this end compare together the situation of bad men and that of the good, when both are fuffering/the misfortunes of life; and then make such improvement as the fubjea will naturally suggest.


I. RELIGION prepares the mind for en- SEk .

cbuntering, with fortitude, the most severe _ ihocks of adversity; whereas vice, by its natural influence on the temper, tends to produce dejetion under the slightest trials.
While worldly men enlarge their possesfions, and extend their connections, they imagine that they are strengthening themselves against all the possible vicissitudes of life. They fay in their hearts, My mountain fandsflrong, and IJhall never be moved. But so fatal is their delusion, that, instead of strengthening, they are weakening that which only can support them when thore vicissitudes come. It is their mind which muff then support them and their mind, by their sensual attachments, is corrupted and enfeebled. Addieted with intemperate fondness to .
pleasures of the world, they incur twd great and certain evils; they both exclude themselves from every refourLe except the world, and they increase thei:
sensibility to every blow which comes upon them from that quarter.

They have peither princripes nor tem. , per which cia fland theaffýalt of trouble They have no principleq which lead thwp to look beyond the .dinary xotation if events; and therefore, .vyhen apisforEuqe involve them, -the ,profpet muff be c9%-
frdtlefs on every  Tlie primes -have jd.quflified btem fcor .loqking up to the fiftlance of any higherlp9wer than ieir Spwa bilty,,or for relyipg qn any better guide than their own wisdom. And as 9m principle, they can derive npo fiup port, so in . temper corrupt4ed pro fperity they fipnd np relief, They have lotc that moderation of mind 'which qnr ablos ; wife man to accommodate hinmflf to ,his situation. ,Long fpd with, false hopes, .they axe exasperated aqd flung by every difappoQpttpent. Luxurious pn4 pffeminate, they gai bear-;no ,vneafinef.
Prpud and pre:fumnptuoup, they can brooi no oppofltion. ,pouriAhing difpofitiona which so little ,it this uncertai4g iate, they have inf{ued a dobpepgqtT,of jit7 ternefs into the cup of woe;., they fa1ae hlarpened the edge of that sward which is lifted up to finite them. Strangers to all the temperate Tatisfadions of a good and a pure mind; strangers to every pleasure ercept what was seasoned by vice or vanity, their adversity is to the last dqgree difconsolate. Health and opulence were the two pillars en which they reled. -Shake either of them I and their whole edifice of hope and comfort falls. Prdftrate and forloarn they are left on the ground; obliged to join with the man of Vphraim in his abr jea tamentation, They have taken ay my gods, *which I hawe inade, and *what ihave: I more * ?-Such are the causes 'to which we must ascribe the brokeki fpirts, the peevish temper, and impatient passions, that so pften attend the declining age, or falling fortunes of vicious -men.


But how different is the condition of a truly good man in .those trying fituationo .of life ! Religion had gradually prsepred his mind for all the events of this iaqonr itantrfiate. It had inftruded him 'in the * Judes ailli. 24. -  I nature of true happiness. It had early 11. weaned him from the undue love of the world, by discovering to him its vanity, and by setting higher profpeas in his view. Afflifions do not attack him by surprise, and therefore do not overwhelm him. He was equipped for the florm, as well as the calm, in this dubious navigation of life. Under those conditions he knew himself to be brought hither, that he -was not to retain always the enjoyrnent of what he loved: And therefore he is not overcome by disappointment, when that which is mortal, dies; when that which is mutable, begins to change; and when that which he knew to be transient, passes away.

All the principles which religion teaches, 
and all the hlabits which it forms, are favourable to firength of mind. It will be f6und, that whatever purifies, fortifies also the heart. In the course of living righteously, soberly, and godly, a good man acquires a steady and well-governed fpitit. Trainel, by Divine grace, to enjoy with moderation the advantages of the world, neither lifted up by success, nor .
enervated with sensuality, he meets the changes, in his lot without unmanly dejedion, He is inured to temperance and restraint. He has learned firmness and felf-command. He is accustomed to look up to that Supreme Providence, which disposes of human affairs, not with reverence only, but with trust and hope.

The time of prosperity was to him not merely a season of barren joy, but produaive of much useful improvement, He had cultivated his mind. He had flored it with useful knowledge, with good principles, and virtuous difpofi*
tions. These resources remain entire, when the days of trouble come. They remain with him in sickness, as in health in poverty, as in the midfl of riches; in his dark and solitary hours, no less than when surrounded with friends and gay society. From the glare of prosperity, he can, without deje&ion, 
 RM. withdraw into the shade. Excluded ' from several advantages of the world, 
he may be obliged to retreat into a narrower circle; but within that circle he will find many comforts left. His chief pleasures were always of the calm, innocent, and temperate kind; and over there, the changes of the world have the least power. His mind is a kingdom to him; and he can flill' enjoy it. The world did not bestow upon him all 'his enjoyments; and therefore it is not in the poyer of the world, by its most cruel attacks, to carry them all away.
  THE difireffes of life are alleviated to good men, by reflections on their past condua; while, by such refledions, they are highly aggravated to the bad. During the gay and aaive periods of life, sinners ýelude, in some measure, the force of conscience. Carried round in the whirl of affairs and pleasures; intent on contrivance, or eager in pursuit; amused by hope, or elated by enjoyment; they are sheltered by thit croud 8f frifles which furrotrids SE 
them, ft61h serious fhought. But tonfdiencd is too great a power to retnain always suppressed. There is in every man life, a period 4when he shall be 'made to fland forth as a 'real objeCt to his own view: And when that period c6des, W6 to him who is galled by the fight! 'In the dark and solitary hour of liftrefs, with a mind hurt and fore from some recent wound of fortune, how fhafl he bear to have his charaCter for the first time disclosed to him, in that humiliating light under which guilt will necessarily prefeht it ? Then, the recollecion of the 'paft becomes dreadful. It exhibits to him a life thrown away on vanities and follies, or consumed in flagitioufnefs and fin; no itation properly supported; no material duties fulfilled. Crimes -which once had been easily palliated, rife before him in fheir native deformity. The sense of guilt mixes itferf with all that has befallen him.
'He behl6ds, or thinks that he beholds, the hand of the God %Yhom he hath of "

The piety and virtue of his former life were as feeds sown in his prosperous slate, of which he reaps the fruits in the season of adversity. The riches, the pleasures, and the friends of the world, may have made wings to themselves, and sown away. But the improvement which he made of those advantages while they lasted, the temperate spirit with which he enjoyed them, the beneficent aCions which he performed, and the good example which he set to others, remain behind. By the memory of these, he enjoys his prosperity a fecond time in refletion; and perhaps this second and refle enjoyment is not inferiour to the first. It arrives at a more critical and needful time. It affords him the high fatisfation of having extraaed lasing pleasure from that which is lhort; and of having fixed that which by its nature was changing.- If my race be  now about to end, I have this com

"6 that misfortunes alone form the chief misery of man. None but the guilty are completely miserable. The misgiving and distrust, the accusations and reproaches of their minds, the sense of having drawn down upon their heads the evils which they fuffer,'and the terrifying expedation of more and worse evils to come; these are the essential ingredients of human misery. They not only whet the edge, but they envenom the darts of affli&ion, and add poison to the wound. Whereas, when misfortunes assail a good man, they carry no such fatal auxiliaries in their train. They may ruffle the surface of 'his foul; but there is a strength, within, which resists their farther imprefion. The constitution of his mind is found. The world can inflia upon it no wounds, but what admit of cure."

feel all its weakness by the pressure of adversity. Dejeced with evils which overpower its strength, it relies no longer on itself. It casts every where around, a wishing, exploring eye, for some shelter to screen, some power to uphold it; and if, when abandoned by the world, it can find nothing to which it may fly in the room of the world, its slate is truly forlorn. pow, whither should the ungodly, in this situation, turn for aid ? After having contended with the florms of adverse fortune till their spirits are exhausted, gladly would they retreat at last to the fanauary of religion. But that fanauary is thut against them; nay, it is environed with terrours. They behold there, not a Prote&or to whom they can fly, but a Judge whom they dread; and in those moments when they need his friendship the most, they are reduced to deprecate his wrath. If he once called when they reftufed, and Jfretched out his hands when they would not regard, how much reafor - have they to fear that he will leave them n6w to eat* the fruit of their own ways, and to be filled' with their own devi'ces that he will laugh at their calamity, and Smock when theirfear tometh ?

But of all the thoughts which can enter into the mind, in the season of diftreis, the belief of' an interest in his favour who rules, the world is the most soothing.
Every form of religion has afforded to virtuous men some degree of this confoTation. But' it was reserved for the Chriftian revelation, to carry it to its highe4 point. For it is the direa scope of that revelation, to accommodate tifelf to though circumstances of man, under two rhair ews; as guilty in the fight of God, and as ffruggling with the evils of the world. Under the former, it discovers to him a Mediator and an atonement; under the latter, it promises him the Spirit of grace and consolation. It is'a system of complete relief, extending from our spiritual to our' temporal distresses.

But much more when those pleasures, one after another, begin to withdraw; when life alters its form, and 8 ER  becomes dark and chearlefs; when its * changes warn the most inconsiderate, that what is so mutable will soon pass entirely -way; then, with pungent earnestness comes home that question to the heart, Into what world are we next to go ?- -
How miserable the man, who, under the diftraaions of calamity, hangs doubtful about an event which so nearly concerns him; who, in the midst of doubts and anxieties, approaching to *that awful boundary which separates this world from the next, shudders at the dark profpec before him; wishing to exist after death, and yet afraid of that existence; catching at every feeble hope which fuperflition can afford him, and trembling, in the fame moment, from refledion upon his crimes!

But blessed be God who hath brought life and immortality to light; who hath not only brought them to light, but secured them to good men; and by the death and refurrediop of Jesus Christ, hath begotten them unto the lively hope of an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not 
away. Justly is'this hope flyled in fcrip-i ture, the anchor of the fpol,, both Jure and Jfedfafl. or what an anchor is to a lhip in a dark night, on. an, unknown coast, and ainidft a boisterous ocean, that is this hope to the foul .when :diftrated by.
the confusions of the, world. In danger, it gives ,security; amidst general fluauation, it .affords one fixed point of ref. It is indeed the most eminent of all the advantages which religion now, confers.
For, confider the mighty power of hope over the human mind. It is the univerfal comforter. It is the, fpripg of all human a6tivity. Upon futurity;, men are conflantly fufpendedc Animated by the profpel of some distant good, they toil and fuffer, through the whole course of life; and it is not  much what they are at present, as what, they hope to be in fome.after time,, that enlivens their motions; fixes attention, and stimulates induftry..

The disorders which vice has introduced into the works of God, are about to terminate; and all tears are soon to be wiped away from the eyes of the juft.-The firm asfurance of this happy conclusion to the yexations and the vanities of life, works a greater effeft on the sincere illiterate Chriflian, than all the refinements of philolophy can work on the molf learned Infidele These miy gratify the mind that is at cafe; may fCoth the heart when slightly discomposed; but when it is fqre and deeply torn, w4en bereaved of its best '. ard most beloved comforts, 'the orily'con IL Sifolations that can.then find access, arise from the hope of a better world; where those comforts shall be again restored; and all the virtuous shall be assembled, in the presence of him who made them.
Such hopes banish that despair which overwhelms, and leave only that tender melancholy which softens the heart, and often renders the whole charaCter more gentle and amiable. '

OF this nature are- the resources which religibn provides for good men. By its previous discipline, it trains them to fortitude; by the refletions of a good conscience it fooths, by the sense of Divine favour it supports them; and when every comfort fails them on earth, it chears them with the hope of Heaven. Diftinguifhing his servants with such advantages, God is justly said to ereCt his pavilion over them in the evil time. He not onlyfpreads a tent for them in the *wilderness, but he transforms in some measure the. Rate of nature around them. To use the beautiful language of ancient prophecy; In the  -
fart, the thirfly land, where no water is, he openeth springs. -Itnlead of the thorn, he'maketh the fir-tree to come up ; infead of the briar, the myrtle tofpring. In midfl of the habitation of dragons, he maketh green paflures rife, and f9ill waters flow around his people.

THE improvement to be made of there truths, is as obvious, as it is important.
Let us fludy so to condut our lives, that we may be qualified for deriving such confolations from religion. To their reality, and their importance, all mankind bear witness. For no sooner are they overtaken ,by distress, than to religion they fly.
This, throughout every age, has been the universal shelter which the young and the old, the high and the low, the giddy and the serious, have fought to gain, as soon as they found- that reft could be no where else procured for the weary head, or the aching thAt croid to religion for relief, sow few  are entitled to approach that sacred source of comfort ? On what feeble iprops -&
their hopes and 'pretenfions relt ? Ho, much superstition mingles with that religion to which men are driven by ýdifirefs and fear You must first apply to 'it as the guide of life, before you can have recourse to it as the refuge of sorrow. You muff submit to its legislative authority, and experience ifs renewing influence, before you can look for its cdnfolatory effe&.
You muff -fecute the teftiritony dof -a goofl conscience, hnd 'peace with God through Jesus Christ; otherwife, when the floods /hall'come, and the rains defcenda and the woinds blow, tlhe houf6 which ydu had proposed for your retreat, shall prove the houfi founded on thefand, not on the rock."
"There are two plans, 'and tifere are but 'two, on which any aiah can propose to coridut himself through 'the dangers and distresses of human life. The oone is the plan of worldly wifdonr; tlie 'other, that -of determine 'idhereone to -conscience."
"He who gCLs upon -the former, lays prin.  xiple aside, and truits lhs defece .to his art and ability. .He avails himfglf of every advantage -which his knowledge 9f the world suggests. He attends to nothing but what he considers as his interest; and, unconfined .by cqpfcignce, pprfues it by every course ,which promises -him 4pccers. This planl, though too often adopted, will be found, on .trial, ineffeaual and deceitful. For hnuman ability is an unequal snatch for the violent .and unforeseen 'viciffitudes of the world. When these torrents rife in their might, they sweep away in a rnoynent the banks which worldly wisdom .had reared for ,dfense, and overwhelm 4alike .the .crafty sand the artless. IJ the mean time, perfops, this £.harader condemn themselves to Jive a snoft unquiet life. They (pass their days in perpetual anxiety, listening to every motion ; iartled by every-alarm; changiing their measures .on every new'Coccurrence; and when distress breaks .in over all their, defences, they are left under it, lopelefs and disconsolate."
"S  The'plan which; in opposition to this, "
", religion recommends, is both more ho nourable in itself, ahd more effeaual for security, is, at all hazards, to do your duty, and to leave the consequences to God. Let him who would aa upon this plan, adopt for the rule of his condua, that maxim of the Pfalmifl  Truf in the Lord, and do good *. To firm integrity, let him join a humble reliance oA God."
"Let his adherence to duty, encourage his religious trust. Let his religious trust, inspire him with fortitude in the performance of his duty. Let him know no path but the firaight and direa one. In the most critical moments of adion, let him ask no further questions, than What is the right, the fit, the worthy part?"
"How as a man, and as a Christian, it becomes him to ? Having received the decision of conscience, let him commit his *way unto the Lord. Let him, without trepidation or wavering, proceed in, difCharging his duty; resolved, that though the world may make him unfortunate, it thall never make him base; and confiding, that in wvhat God and his conscience re,uire him to aQt or fuffer, God and a good conscience will support him.-Such principles as these; are the best preparation for the vicissitudes of the human lot. They are the shield of inward peace. He who thinks and ats thus, fhallUbe exposed to no wounds but what religion can cure."

"# SERMON III. On the Influence of Religion upon Prosperity."
"## PSAL. i. 3. He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doth shall prosper."
"On the Influence of RELIGION upon fle hall be like a tree planted by'the'rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf alfoJhall not wither, and whatsoever be doth Jall prosper."
"H happy influence of religion  . upon human life, in the time of adversity, has been considered in the preceding discourse. Concerning this the fentiments of men are more generally agreed, than with refpet to some other prerogatives which religion claims. They very readily assign to it the office of a Comforter. But as long as their state is profperous, they are apt to account it an unnecef fafy guest, perhaps an unwelcome intrtder."
"Let us not be thus unj'uft to religion, nor confine its importance to one period only in the life of -man. It was never intended to be merely the nurse of sickness, and thV tass of old age. I purpose now to show you, That it is no less essential to the enjoyment of prosperity, than to the comfort ofadverfity: That prosperity is prosperous, if we may -be allowed the expression, ,to a good man only; and that to every other person, it will prove, notwithfianding its fair appearance, a barren andjoylefs slate."
"The Psalmist, in the Text, by an image -taken from one of the most beautiful objedts in nature, describes a man who flouL 'rifhes in full prbfperity. But to whom is tfhe description limited ? To him, as the -preceding verses inform us, that walketh I'ot in the counsel of the ungodly, nor flandeth in the way of fJiners, nprjitteth in the feat of the fcorful, but hlIth his delight in the law of God. He only is like the -tree .planted by the rivers of water; whilst the odlyy, as he adds, are htotfon but, how  prosperous soever they may appear to the ' world, are in truth but like the chaf -which the wind driveth away. In confirmation of this doarine, I shall lay before you, some of those circumflances which diftinl guifh the prosperity of the good man bet yond that of the finner; and shall conclude, with pointing out the dangers and miseries, into which the latter is apt to be betrayed, by his favourable situation in the world."
"I. PIETY, and gratitude to God,. "
"tribute in a high degree to enliven profperity. Gratitude is a pleasing emotion."
"The sense of being diflinguifhed by the kindness of another, gladdens the heart, warms it with reciprocal affeaion, and gives to any poffeffion which is agreeable ,in itself, a double relish, from its being the gift of a friend, Favours conferred by men, I acknowledge, may prove but-denfome. For human virtue is never perse and sometimes unreasonable expectations on the one  sometimes a mortifying fenfq of dependence on the, other, "
"corrode in secret the pleasure of beriefitg, 1."
"'and convert the obligations of friendship ."
",into grounds of jealousy. Buit nothing of this kind can asset the'intercourfe of gratitude with Heaven. Its fav6urs are wholly disinterested ; , and with a gratitude the most cordial and unfufpicious, a good man looks up to that Almighty Benefator, who aims at no end but the happiness of those whom he blesses, and who desires no return from them but a devout and thankful *heart. While others can trace their profperity to no higher source than a concurrence of worldly causes, and, often, of mean or trifling incidents, which occafionally favoured their designs; with what fuperiour satisfaction edoes the servant of God jreniark the hand of. that gracious Power, which hath raised him up; -which hath happily conduaed him through the various fleps of life, and crowned him with the most favourable diftinaion beyond his equals ?"
"Let us farther confider,: that not only gratitude for the past, but a chearing sense ER  Qs God favour at the present, enters into Sthe pious emotion, They are only the virtuous, who in their profpermua days hear this voice addressed to them; Ga bhy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry hearl ; for God now acceptetb thy 'works- . He who is the Author of their prosperity, gives, them a title to enjoy, with complacency, his own gift. While bad men snatch the pleasures of the world as by flealth, without counter narce from God the proprietor of the world; the righteous fit openly down  the feast of life, under the fmiile of approving Heaven. No guilty fears damp their joys. The blessing of God rests upoa all that they poffeffs; his prote&ion flprr rounds them; and hence, in the habitations of the righteous, is found the voics of rejoicing and falvatien. A luthe unknowa to others, invefte, in their fight, the whole face of nature. Their piety refle a funshine from heavep upon the prosperity of the world unites in one point of view, "
"- Eccles. ix. 7 the the smiling afpet, both of the powers ht  above, and of the objets below. Not I only have they as full a relish as others, of the innocent pleasures of life, but, moreover, ir these they hold communion with God. In all that is good or fair, they trace his hand. From the beauties of nature, from the improvements of art, from the ernjoyments of social life, they raise their affedion to the source of all the happiness which furtounds them; and thus widen the sphere of their pleasures, by adding intelleetual, and spiritual, to earthly joys."
"For illustration of what I have said on this head, remark that chearful enjoyment of a prosperous state which King David had, when he wrote the twenty-third Vfalm; and compare the highest pleasures of the riotous finner, with the happy and satisfied spirit which breathes throughout that Pfalm.-In the midst of the splendour of royalty, with what amiable simplicity of gratitude does he took up to the Lord as Ms Shepherd; happier in ascribing all his success to divine favour, than to the policy of his counsels, or to 'the force of his III. armis! How mnany inflances of divine goodness arose before him in pleasing rec membrance, -when with such relish he speaks of the green paflures and fill Iwater4 bejide which God, had led him ; of his cup which he hath made to overflow ; and of the table which he hath prepared for him in presence of his enemies .! With what perset tranquillity does he look forward to the time of his passing through the valley of. the jhadowvf death.; i nappalled by that .Spetre, whose most distant appear-,"
"prce blasts the prosperity ds sinners ! He fears no evil, as long as the r9d and the flaffof his Divine Shepherd are with him;'"
"and,, through all the. unknowr periods of this and of -a future existence, commits himself to his guidance with secure and triumphant hope. , Surely goodness and percy Jhall fqllow me all the days of my ife ; and I will dwell in the hose of the Lord for ever.-What a purified, sentimental enjoyment. of. prosperity,. is here .exhibited! How different from that gross relilh of worldly pleasures, which belongs to thbfe who behold only the terrefirial of tlings; who raise their views to no higher objeCs than the succession of human contingencies, and the weak efforts of human ability; who have no proteCtor or patron in the heavens, to enliven their prosperity, or to warm their hearts with gratitude and trust!"
"II. RELIGION affords to good men pe culiar security in the enjoyment of their prosperity. One of the first reflections which muff strike every thinking man, aster his situation in the world has become agreeable, is, That the continuance of such a situation is most uncertain. From a variety of causes, he lies open to change."
"On many sides he fees that he may be pierced;- and the wider his comforts extend, the broader is the mark which he spreads to the arrows of misfortune. Hence many a secret alarm to the reflecting mind; and to those who rejet all such alarms, the real danger increases, in proportion to their improvident security."
"By worldly assistance it is vain to think of providing any effeaual defence, feeing the world mutability is the very cause of our terrour. It is from a higher principle, from a power fuperiour to the world, that relief must be fought, amidift such difquietudes of the heart. He who in his profperity can look up to One who is witness to his moderation, humanity, and charity; he who can appeal to Heaven, that he has not been elated by pride, nor overcome by pleasure, but has studied to employ itq gifts to the honour of the giver; this man, if there be any truth in religion, if there be any benignity or goodness in the administration of the universe, has just cause for encouragement and hope. Not that an interest in the Divine grace will perpetuate to a good man, more than to others, a life of unruffled prosperity."
"Change and alteration form the very esfence of the world. But let the world change around him at pleasure, he has ground to hope that it shall not be able to make him unhappy. Whatever may vary, "
"God providence is fitll the fame; and his love to the righteous remains unaltered. -"
"If it shall be the Divine will to remove one comfort, he trusts that some other fiall be given. Whatever is given, whatever is taken away he confides, that in the last result allfhall work for his good."
"Hence, he is not disturbed, like bad men, by the inflability of the world."
"Dangers, which overcom8 others, ihake not his more steady mind. He enjoys the pleasures of life pure and unallayed, because he enjoys them, as long as they last, without anxious terrours. They are not his all, his only good. He welcomes them when they arrive; and when they pass away, he can eye them, as they depart, without agony or despair. His profperity firikes a deeper and firmer root than that of the ungodly. And for this reason he is compared,.in the Text, to a tree planted by the rivers of water ; a tree, whose branches the tempest may indeed bend, but whose roots it cannot touch; a tree, which may occasionally be firipped  of its leaves and blossoms, but which still . . maintains its place, and in due season flou."
"rifhes a-new. Whereas the finner' in his prosperity, according to the allusion in the -book of Jab, resembles the rujh that groweth up in the mire *; a slender reed, that may flourish green for a while by the of the brook, as long as it is cherilhed by the fun, and fanned by the breeze; till the first bitter blast breaks its feeble stem, roots it out from its bed, and lays it in -the duff.

"III. RELIGION forms good men to the most proper temper for the enjoyment of prosperity. A little refleaion may satisfy us, that mere poffeffion, even granting it to be secure, does not conflitute enjoyment."
"Give a man all that is in the power of the world to bestow; surround him with riches; crown him with honours; invest him, if you will, with absolute dominion; but leave him at the .fame time under some SE RIt cret opprelfion ot heaviness of heart; your beflow indeed the materials of enjoymeht, but you deprive him of ability to ,extra~&"

"rode but one of his smallest nerves; and you shall prefenfly fee all his gaiety vanifh; you shall hear him complain, that he is a miserable creature, and express his envy of the peasant and the cottager.-"
"And can you believe, that a disease in the foul is less fatal to enjoyment, than a difease in the animal frame; or that a found mind is not as essential, as a found body, to the prosperity of man ?-Let us rate sensual gratifications as higlt as we please, "
"IIm. we bhall be made to feel that the feat of enjoyment is in'the foul., The corrupted temper, and thie guilty passions of the bad, fruftrat6 the effe6 of every advantage which the world confers on them. The world may call them men of pleasure, but of all men they are the greatest foes to pleasure. From their eagerhefs to grasp, -they firangle and destroy it. None but the temperate, the regular, and the virtuous, know how to enjoy^profperity."
"They bring to its comforts the manly relifh of a found uncorrupted mind. They flop at the proper point, before enjoyment legenerates into disgust, and pleaiure is converted into pain. They are stranger4 to those complaints which flow from spleen, paprice, and all the fantastical distresses of a vitiated mind. While riotous indulgence enervate§ both the body and the mind, purity and virtue heighten all the powers of human fruition. Moderate and simple pleasures relish high with the temperate; in the midst of his studied refinements, the voluptuary languilhes."
"Wherever guilt mingles with prosperity, "
"a certain gloom and heaviness enter along with it. Vitious intrigues never fail to entangle and embarrass those who engage in them. But innocence confers ease and freedom on the mind; leaves it open to every pleasing sensation; gives a lightness to the spirits, similar to the native gaiety of youth and health; ill imitated, and ill supplied, by that forced levity of the viti."
"ous, which arises not from the health, but from the drunkenness of the mind."
"Feeble are all pleasures in which the heart has no part. The felfifh gratifications of the bad, are both narrow in theiri circle, and short in their duration. But prosperity is redoubled to a good man, by his generous use of it. It is refleted back upon him from every one whom he makes happy.

"xity of good men, by the. profpeC which it affords them of greater happiness to come in another world. I showed, in the foregoing discourse, the mighty effea of the hope of Heaven, in relieving the mitid .under the troubles of life.

What is present, is never fufficient to give us.full fatisfa&ion. To the present we muff always join some agreeable anticipations of futurity, in order to complete our pleasure. What an accession then muff the prosperity of the righteous man receive, when, born with a fmobth and gentle gale along the current of life, and looking round on all the blessings of his slate, he can confider these as no more than an introducion to higher scenes which are hereafter to open; he can view his present life, as only the 0 ER  porch through which he is to pats into the IlL Spalace of bliss; and his present joys, as but a feeble stream, dispensed for his occa'"

"It is the fate of all human pleasures, by continuance, to fade; of most of them, to cloy. Hence, in the most prosperous state, there are frequent intervals'.of languor, and even of dejetion. There are vacuities in the happiest life, which it is not in the power of the world to fill up, What relief so adapted to those vacant oir dejeaed periods, as the pleasing hopes which arise from immortality ? How barref and imperfec that prosperity, whichl can have tecourfe to no such tubfidiary SE "
"comfort, in order to animate the ftagna- I of vulgar life, and to supply the in."
"fufficiency of worldly pleasure !"
"Worldly prosperity declines with  dining life. In youth its relish was brisk and poignant. It becomes more sober as life advances; and flattens as life descends. He who lately overflowed with chearful spirits and high hopes, begins to look back with heaviness on the days of foater years. He thinks of his old companions, who are gone; and re*
views-paft scenes, more agreeable than any which ate likely to return. The adtivity of pursuit is weakened. The gaiety of 4mufement is fled. The gratifications of sense languish. When his accuflomed pleasures, one after another, thus fleal treacherously away, what can he, who is an utter fttanger to religion, and to the hope of heaven, substitute in their place ?
--But even in that drooping period, the promises and hopes of religion support the spirits of a good man till the latest i, hour. His leaf, it is said in the Text, 
li ]Jiall not wither, It thall not be in thb power of time to blast his prosperity But old age shall receive him into a quieg rel~eat, where, if lively sensations fail, gentle pleasures remain to sooth him.
That hope of immortality, which formerly improved his other enjoyments, pow in a great measure supplies their ibfence. Its importance rises, in proportion as its obr jeat draws near. He is not forsaken by:
the world, but retires from it with dignity; xeviewing with a calm mind the part which he has aaed, and trufling to the promise of God for an approaching reward. Such sentiments adl expetations shed a pleasing tranquillity over the old age of the righteous man. They make the evening of his days go down unclouded; and allow the fiream of life, though fallen low, to run clear to the last drop.

THUS I have shown, I hope, with full evidence, what material ingredients religion and a good conscience are in the pro 
fperity of life. Separated from them, 


prosperity, how fair soever it may feent to the world, is insipid, nay, frequently ioxious to the poffeffor: United with them, it rises into a real blessing bestowed by God upon man. God giveth to a man that is good in his fght, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the fnner he giveth fore travel, to gather, and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God*.

ALLOW me now to conclude the sub je6, with representing to the prosperous pen of the world, those crimes and miseries into which the abuse of their condition is likely to betray them, and calling upon them to beware of the dangers with which they are threatened.

It is unfortunate for mankind, that those situations which favour pleasure, are too generally adverse to virtue. Virtue requires internal government and discipline; prosperity relaxes the mind, and inflames the passions. Virtue is supported by a  regard to what is future; prosperity at taches us wholly to what is present. The charaaeriflicks of virtue, are tnodefly and humility; the most common attendants of prosperity, are pride and presumption.
One should think, that prosperity would prove the strongest incitement to remember and to honour that God who beftows it.
Yet such is the perverseness of human na, ture, that it proves much oftener the motive to impiety. The changes of the world call the attention of men to an Invifible Power. But a train of events proceeding according to their with, leads them to nothing beyond what they fee.
The Supreme Giver is concealed from view by his own gifts. This inflance of success they ascribe to a fortunate concurrence of worldly causes; that acquisition, to their own flill and industry; unmindful of him, who from the beginning arranged that series of causes, and who placed them in circumitances where their industry could operate with success. From forgetting God, they too often proceed to despise him.

All that is light or giddy in their minds,  is fpt in motion by the gale of prosperity.
Arrogance and felf-fufficiency are lifted up; and their state is considered, as fecured by their own firength. Hence that pride of countenance, through which the wicked, in their prosperity, as David observes, refuse tofeek after God. They are described as speaking loftily, and setting their mouth againfj the Heavens. They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the found of the organ; and they fay unto God, Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. What is the Al..
mighty, that we should serve him? Or what profit Jfould we have, if twe pray unto him ?

They fay unto God, Depart from us.-.

What an impious voice! Could we haire believed it possible, that worldly pleafures should so far intoxicate any human heart ? Wretched and infatuated men !
Have you ever examined on what your confidence refls ?-You'have said in your hearts, You Jhall never be moved; you fancy yourselves placed on a mountain  which flandeth frong.

No mighty effort, no long preparation of events, is needed to overturn your prosperity. By flow degrees it rose. Long time, much labour, and the concurrence of many assisting causes, were necessary to rear it up; but one flight incident can entirely overthrow it. Suspicions areinfused into the patron or the prince aon whom you depend; and your disgrace ensues. Exercise, or amusement, kindles a fever in the veins of those whom you loved; and you are robbed of your comforts and hopes. A few grains of sand lodge themselves within you; and the reft of your life is disease- and misery."

"# SERMON  On our Imperfect Knowledge of a Future State."

"T HE Apostle here describes the im- "

"tors have rendered by feeing them darkly that is, the truth in part discovered, in part concealed, and placed beyond our This description, however just and true, "
"cannot fail to occasion some perplexity to an enquiring mind. For it may seem ftrainge, that so much darkness should be left upon those celestial objets, towards which we are at the fame time commanded to aspire. We are strangers in the universe of God. Confined to that' spot on which we dwell, we are permitted to know nothing of what is tranfading in the regions above us and around us. By much labour, we acquire a superficial acquaintance with a few sensible objetas which we find in our present habitation; hut we enter, and we depart, under a total ignorance of the nature and laws of the spiritual world. One fubjea particular, when our thoughts proceed in thisi train, muff often recur upon the mind with peculiar anxiety; that is, the importality of the foul, and the future state of man. Exposed as we are at present to such variety of affliiions, and fubjeaed to to inuch disappointment in all our pur- I."
"ftits of happiness, Why, it may be said, . I las our gracious Creator denied us the consolation of a full discovery of our future existence, if indeed such an existence be prepared for us ?--Reason, it is true, suggests many arguments in behalf of immortality: Revelation gives full affurance of it. Yet even that Gospel which is said to have brought life and immortality to light, allows us to fee only through a glass darkly. It doth not yet appear what we Jhall be. Our knowledge of a future world, is very imperfect our ideas of it, are faint and confused. It is not displayed in such a manner, as to make an impreflion suited to the importance of the objedt."
"The faith even of the best men, is much inferiour, both in clearness ahd in force, to the evidence of sense; and proves, on many occasions, infufficient to counterbalance the temptations of the present world."
"Happy moments indeed there fometimesl are in the lives of pious men, when fequeftered from worldly cares, and born up  on the wings of divine contemplation, they rife to a near and transporting view of immortal glory. But such efforts, of the inind are rare, and qannot be .long sup.,"
"ported. When the spirit of meditatiop subsides, this lively sense of a future state decays ; and though the general belief of it remain, yet even good men,. when they return to the ordinary business and cares of life, seem to rejoin the multitude, and to re-affume the fame hopes, and fears, and interefls, which influence, the reft of the world."
"SFrom such refleaions,. a considerable, difficulty rerpeding this important subje&, either arises, or seems to arise. Was such an obscure and imperfec discovery of another life worthy to proceed from God ?'"
"Does it not afford some ground, either to tax his goodness, or to fufpec the evidence of its coming from him ?-This is, the point which we are now to confider;."
"and let us confider it with that close attention which the fubjet merits. Let us en:-."
"quire, whether we Lave any reason, ei !ther to complain of Pr6vidence, or to ob- 4 ER "
".jer to the evidence of a future slate, 'because that evidence is not of a more fenfi1 ble and firiking nature. .Let us 'attempt humbly to trace the reasons, why, though permitted to know and to fee somewhat of the eternal world, we are nevertheless permitted only. to know in part, and to fee through a glass, darkly."
"IT plainly appears to be the plan of the Deity, in all his difpenfations, to mix light with darkness, evidence with uncertainty. Whatever the reasons of this procedure be, the fat is undeniable. He is described in the Old Testament, as a God that hideth himself*. Clouds and darkness, are said tofurround him. His way is in the sea, and his path in the great waters; his footfleps are not known. Both the works:"
"and the ways of God are full of mystery."
"In the ordinary course of his government, innumerable events occur which perplex:"
"us to the utmost. There is a certain limit t6 all our enquiries in religion, beyond I which if we attempt to proceed, we are loft in a maze of inextricable difficulties."
"Even that revelation which affords fucl material inftrudion to man, concerning his duty and his happiness, leaves many doubts unresolved. Why it was not given sooner; why not to all men; why there flould be so many things in it hard to be underflood, are difficulties not inconsiderable, in the midst of that incontestable evidence by which it is supported. If, then, the future state of man be not placed in so full and clear a light as we desire, this is no more than what the analogy of all religion, both natural and revealed, gave us reason to expe&."
"But such a solution of the difficulty will be thought imperfet. It may, perhaps, not give much fatisfa&ion, to show that all religion abounds with difficulties of a like nature. Our situation, it will be said, isfo much the more to be lamented, that not on one only we are confined in our enquiries, but on all hands environed with nyfltrious oblcurity.-Let us then, if so sti "
"much diffatisfied with our condition, give "
"fcppe for once to Fancy, and confider how the plan of Providence might be retified to our with. Let us call upon the Scepick, and desire him to fay, what measure of information would afford him entire fatisfadion."
",This, he will tell us, requires not any long or deep deliberation. He desires only to have his view enlarged beyond the limits of this corporeal slate. Instead of refling upon evidence which requires difcuflion, which must be supported by much reafoping, and which, after all, he alleges yields very imperfed information, he demands the everlasting mansions to be so displayed, if in truth such mansions there be, as to place faith on a level with the evidence of sense. What noble and happy effeas, he exclaims, would inflantly follow, if man thus beheld his present and his future existence at once before him !"
"He would then become worthy of his rank in the creation. Infiead of being the sport; as now, of degrading passions and childild SIv, attachments, he would solely on the principles of immortality. His'purfuit of virtue would be steady; his life would be undiflurbed and happy.

"Were the celestial glory exposed to out admiring view; did the angelic harmony found in our enraptured ears; what earthly concerns could have the power of engaging our attention for a single moment ?

"by which we are at present flimulated, would cease to operate. Human life would present no objets fufficient to rouse the mind; to kindle the spirit of enterprize, or to urge the hand of in*"

How far the change would contribute to his welfare, comes to be considered.

If there be any principle fully afcer tained by religion, it is, That this life was intended for a state of trial and improve'ment to man. His preparation for a better world required a gradual purification, carried on. by fleps of progressive difcipline. The situation, therefore, here assigned him, was such as to answer this design, by calling forth all his aaive powers, by giving full scope to his moral dispositions, and bringing to light his whole characer. Hence it became proper, that difficulty and temptation should arise in the pourfe of his duty. Ample rewards were promised to virtue ; but these rewards were left, as yet, in obscurity and distant profped. The impreflions of  sense were so balanced against the dnfco  ' veries of immortality, as to allow a con fiia between faith and sense, between conscience and desire, between present pleasure and future good. In this confli6t the fouls of good men are tried, improved, and strengthened. In this field, their honours are reaped. Here ate formed the capital virtues of fortitude, temperance, and felf-denial; moderation in prosperity, patience in adversity, sub4iiffion to the will of God, and charity and forgivcnefs to men, amidst the various competitions of worldly interest.

Such is the plan of Divine wisdom for tnan improvement. But put the cafe, that the plan devised by human wisdom were to take place, and that the rewards of the just were to be now fully displayed to view; the exercise of all those graces which I have mentioned, would be entirely superseded. Their very names would be unknown. Every temptation being withdrawn, every worldly attachment being subdued by the overpowering dif 
coveries of eternity, no trial of incerity, EM.


no dlfcrimination of characers, would re, main; no opportunity would be afforded for those aCtive exertions, which are the means of purifying and perfeaing the good. On the competition between time and eternity, depends the chief exercise of human virtue. The obscurity which at present hangs over eternal obje  preserves the competition. Remove that ob.
fcurity, and you remove human virtue from its place. You overthrow that whole system of discipline, by which imperfe& creatures are, in this life, gradually trained up for a more perse& state.

This, then, is the conclusion to which at last we arrive, That the full display which was demanded, of the heavenly glory, would be so far from improving the human foul, that it would abolish those virtues and duties which are the great instruments of its improvement. It would be unsuitable to the chara&er of man in every view, either as an acive being, or a moral agent. It would dif 
 qualify him for taking part in the affairs - of the world; for relishing the pleasures, 
or for discharging the duties of life: In a word, it would entirely defeat the purpose of his being placed on this earth.
And the question, Why the Almighty has been pleased to leave a spiritual world, and the future existence of man, under so much obscurity, resolves in the end into this, Why there should be fuch'a creature as man in the universe of God ?-
Such is the issue of the improvements proposed to be made on the plans of Providence. They add to the discoveries of the fuperiour wisdom of God, and. of the presumption and folly of man.

FROM what has been said, it now ap pears, That no reasonable obje6tion to the belief of a future Rate arises, from the imperfe discoveries of it which we enjoy; from the difficulties that are mingled with its evidence; from our feeing as through a glass darkly, and being left to ,walk by faith and not by fight. It cannot be otherwise, it ought not to be other- 


wife, in our present state. The evidence which is afforded, is fufficient for the conviaion of a .candid mind, fufficient for a rational ground of conduCt; though not so firiking as to withdraw our attention from the present world, or altogether to overcome the impression of fenfible obje6s. In such evidence it becomes us to acquiesce, without indulging either doubts or complaints, on account of our not receiving all the fatisfation which we fondly desire, but which our present immaturity of being excludes. For upon the supposition of immortality, this life is no other than the childhood of existence; and the measures of our knowledge must be proportioned to such a state. To the successive flages of human life, from infancy to old! age, belong certain peculiar attachments, certain cares, desires, and interests; which open not abruptly, but by gradual advances on the mind, as it becomes fit to receive them, and is prepared for ading the part to which, in  their order, they pertain. Hence, in the.


, , education of a child, no one thinks of in spiring him all at once with the know.
ledge, the sentiments, and views of a man, and with contempt for the exer.
cifes and amusements of childhood. On the contrary, employments suited to his age are allowed to occupy him. By these his powers are gradually unfolded; and advantage is taken of his youthful pursuits, to improve and firengthen his mind; till, flep by step, he is led on to higher profpeds, and prepared for a larger and more important scene of adion.

This analogy, which so happily illus trates the present condu6t of -the Deity towards man, deserves attention the more, as it is the very illustration used by the Apofile, when treating of this fubjea in the context. Now, says he, we know in part--ut when that which is perfed is come, that which is in part Jhall be done away. When I was a child, 1 spake as 4 child, I underfood as a child, I thought as 4 Child i but when I became a man, I put away childi things. For now we fee ER  

through a glass, darkly ; but then, face to face: Now I know in part; but then, I Jhall know even as I am known. Under the care of the Almighty, our education is now going on, from a mortal to an immortal state. As much light is let in upon us, as we can, bear without injury.
When the objets become too splendid and dazzling for our fight, the curtain is drawn. Exercised in such a field of adion, as suits the strength of our unripened powers, we are, at the fame time by proper profpeas and hopes, prompted to aspire towards the manhood of our nature, the time when childih thingsJhall be put away. But fRill, between those future profpeas, and the impression of present objets, such an accurate proportion is established, as on the one hard ihall not produce a total contempt of earthly things, while we aspire to those that are heavenly; and on the other, shall not encourage such a degree of attachment to our present slate, as would ER  render us unworthy of future advanceL ment. In a word, the whole course of things is so ordered, that we may neither by an irregular and precipitate education, become lyen too soon; nor by a fond and trifling indulgence, be (uffered to continue children for ever, 
LET these refletions not only remove the doubts which may arise from our obscure knowledge of immortality, but likewise produce the highest admiration of the wisdom of our Creator. The ftructure of the natural world affords innumerable instances of profound design, which no attentive fpedator can survey without wonder. In the moral world, where the workmanship is of much finer and more delicate contexture, fubjets of flill greater admiration open to view. But admiration muff rife to its -Jigheft point, when those parts of the moral conflitution, which at first were reptted blemifhes, which carried the appearance of objecions, either to the wisdom or the goodness of Providence, are discovered,  

on more accurate infpetion, to be adjufted with the most exquisite propriety.
We have now seen, that the darkness of man condition is no less essential to his well-being, than the light which he enjoys. His internal powers, and his external situation, appear to be exaaly fitted to each other. Those complaints which we are apt to make, of our limited capacity and narrow views, of our inability tQ penetrate farther into the future destination of man, are found, from the foregoing observations, to be just as unreasonable, as the childish complaints of our not being formed with a microscopic eye, nor furnifhed with an eagle wing that is, of not being endowed with powers which would subvert the nature, and countera&
the laws, of our present slate.

In order to do justice to the fubjed, I must observe, That the fame reasoning which has been now employed with refpe6 to our knowledge of immortality, is'
equally applicable to many other branches SE  of intelleaual knowledge. Thus, why weý are permitted to know so little of the nature of that Eternal Being who rules the universe; why the manner in which he operates on the natural and moral world, is wholly concealed; why we are kept An such ignorance, with refpe£; to the extent of his works, to the nature and agency of spiritual beings, and even with refpet to Sthe union between our own foul and body:
To all these, and several other enquiries of the fame kind, which often employ the solicitous researches of speculative men, the answer is the fame that was given to the interesting question which makes- the subje& of our discourse. The degree of knowledge desired, would prove incompatible with the design, and with the proper bufiness of this life. It would raise us to a sphere too exalted; would reveal obje6ts too great and striking for ourprefent faculties; would excite feelings too strong for us to bear; in a word, would unfit us for thinking or ading like human creatures.
It is therefore reserved for a more 
vanced period of our nature; and the hand of Infinite wisdom hath in mercy drawn a .
veil over scenes which would overpower the fight of mortals.

One inflance, in particular, of Divine wisdom, is Mo illustrious, and corresponds so remarkably with our present fubjet, that I cannot pass it over without notice; that is, the concealment under which Pro,vidence has placed the future events of our life on earth. The desire of penetrating into this unknown region, has ever been one of the most anxious passions of men. It has often seized the wife as well as the credulous, and given rife to many vain and impious superstitions throughout the whole earth. Burning with curiosity at the approach of some critical event, and impatient under the perplexity of conjecture and doubt, How cruel is Providence, we are apt to exclaim, in denying to man the power of fore fight, and in limiting him to the knowledge of the present moment ? Were he permitted to look forward intP the course of destiny, how much more  suitably would he be prepared for the vari, 
ous turns and changes in his life ? With what moderation would he enjoy his profperity, under the fore-knowledge of an approaching reverse ? And with what eagernefs be prompted to improve tte flying hours, by feeing the inevitable term draw nigh which was to finish his course ?

But while Fancy indulges such vain fires and criminal complaints, this coveted fore-knowledge must clearly appear to the eye of reason, to be the most fatal gift which the Almighty could bestow. If in this present mixed slate, all the successive scenes of distress through which we are to pass, were laid before ps in ore view, perpetual sadness would overcast our life.
Hardly would any transient gleams of intervening joy be able to force their way through the cloud, Faint would be the relish of pleasures, of which we foresaw the close : Insupportable the burden of asflitions, under which we were oppressed by a load, not only of present, but of anticipated foTrows. Friends would begin their union, with lamenting the day which  was to dissolve it; and, with weeping eye, the parent would every moment behold the child whom he knew that he was to lose. In short, as soon as that mysterious veil, which now covers futurity, was lifted up, all the gaiety of life would difappear; its flattering hopes, its pleating illusions, would vanifi; and nothing but its vanity and sadness remain. The forefight of the hour of death would continually interrupt the course of human asfairs; and the overwhelming prospect of the future, instead of exciting men to proper aaivity, would render them immoveable with consternation and dismay..--
How much more friendly to man is that mixture of knowledge and ignorance which is allotted him in this state 1 Ignorant of the events which are to befall us, and of the precise term which is to conclude our life, by this ignorance our enjoyment of present objeas is favoured; and knowing that death is certain, and that human affairs are full of change, by  this knowledge our attachment to those ob je6s is moderated. Precisely in the fame manner, as, by the mixture of evidence and obscurity which remains on the prosped of a future state, a proper balance is preserved between our love of this life, and our desire of a better. '

The longer that our thoughts dwell oa this fubjet, the more we must be con.
vinced, that in nothing the Divine wisdom is more admirable, than in proportioning knowledge to the necessities of man, Inflead of lamenting our condition, that we are permitted only tofee as through a glass darkly, we have reason to bless our Creator, no less for what he hath concealed, than for what he hath allowed us to know. He is wonderful in counsel, as he is excellent in working. He is wife in heart, and his thoughts are deep. How unfearchabie are the riches of the wisdom of the knowledge of God!"
"FROM the whole vievi which we have taken of the subjeCt, this important in "
"firution arises, That the great design of "
"all the knowledge, and in particular of the religious knowledge which God hath asforded us, is, to fit us for discharging the duties of life. No useless discoveries are made to us in religion: No discoveries even of useful truths, beyond the precise degree of information, which is fubfervient to right conduc. To this great end all our information points. In this center all the lines of knowledge meet. Life and immortality are brought to light in the gofpel, yet not so displayed as to gratify the curiosity of the world with an astonishing fpedacle; but only so far made known, as to assist and support us in the pratice of our duty. If the discovery were more imperfet, it would excite no desire of immortality; if it were more full and firiking, it would render us careless of life."
"On the first supposition, no fufficient motive to virtue would appear; on the second, no proper trial of it would remain. In the one cafe, we should think and aft like men who have their portion only in this world;  in the other cafe, like men, who have nO concern with this world at all, Whereas now, by the wife conflitution of Heaven, we are placed in the most favourable fitua."
"tion for aaing, with propriety, our allotted part here; and for rising, in due course, to higher honour and happiness hereafter."
"Let us then second the kind intentions of Providence, and at upon the plai which it hath pointed out. Checking our inquisitive solicitude about what tJe Almighty hath concealed, let us dili, gently improve what he hath made knowti Inhabitants of the earth, we are at the fame time candidates for heaven. ' Look."
"ing upon there as only different views of one consistent charader, let us carry on our preparation for heaven, not by abftraaing ourselves from the concerns of this world, but by fulfilling the duties and offices of every station in life. Living soberly, righteously, and godly in the present *world, let us look for that ble/Jd hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Chrjfl."
"3Before I conclude, it may be proper to ER RT observe, That the reasonings in this I course give no ground to apprehend any danger of our being too much influenced by the belief of a future state. have shown the hurtful effects which would follow from too bright and full a discovery of the glory of that state; and in showing this, I have justified the decree of Providence, which permits no such discovery."
"But as our nature is at present constituted, attached by so many firong connections to the world of sense, and enjoying a communication so feeble and distant with the world of spirits, we need fear no danger from cultivating intercourse with the latter as much as possible. On the contrary, from that intercourse the chief security of our virtue is to be fought. The biafs of our nature leans so much towards sense, that from this the peril is to be dreaded, and on this the defence is to be provided."
"Let us then walk by faith. Let us firengthen this principle of ation to the ltmoft of our pbwer.. Let implore the Divirib grate -to firerigthen it withii~ ti more and more: That wve may thence deL itve An aritidote against that flbtile poifdd, which incessant cotiitnetce with the bbjeah of fenfd diffufes through our fouls i that we may hence acquire pHflty ahd dignity of manners, suited to our divifde hoped'"
"and, undefilkd by the pleasures 6f th6 world, unfhakpr by itS tekrodfr, may preserve to the end one cotiftant tenor itegrity. Till At last, having, urndei the cond'uft of Christian faith, happily finiihed the period of discipline, we enter on tiat ftRaie, Where A far hobler fcerie hMAl opefd; vhere eternal objeas flall fhihe in their native splendour; where, thiS twilight of moral life being past, the Suit ofrighteoufhess shall rife; and that which if perfeft being come, that wvhich is in part fJall be done awvay.

# SERMON  On the Death of Christ.

## JOHN xvii. I. Jesus lift up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father! The hour is come On the DEATH of CHRIST4 Preached at the celebration of the SACRAMEfT of the LORD SuppEg.



efuf lift up his eyes to heaven, and faidi Father I The hour is come ;-
 HESE were the words of our blessed Lord on a memorable occa- 

sion. The feast of the passover drew nigh, at which he knew that he was to fuffer.
The night was arrived wherein he was to be delivered into-the hands of his ene.
mies.  had spent the evening in conference with his disciples; like a dying father in the midst of his family; mingling consolations with his last inftruc 

tions. When he had ended his discourse  to them, he lifted uphis eyes to bhaven, 
and, with the words which I have now read, began that solemn prayer of intercession for the Church, which closed his ministry. Immediately after, he went forth with'his disciples into the garden of Gethsemane, and surrendered himself to those who came to apprehend him.

Such was the situation of our Lord at the time of his pronouncing there words.
He saw his mission on the point of being accomplished. He had the profpea full before him, of all that he was about to fuffer.-Father! The hour is come.-What hohr ? An hour the most critical, the molt pregnant with great events, since hours had begun to be numbered, since time had begun to run. It was the hour in which the Son of God was to terminate the labours of his important life, by a death still more important and illuftrious ; the hour of atoning, by his fufferings, for the guilt of mankind; the hour of accomplishing prophecies, types, and symbols, which had be'en carried on through a series of ages; the hour of ' '
cluding the old, and of introducing to the world the new dispensation of religion; the hour of his triumphing over the world, and death, and hell; the hour of his eaing that spiritual kingdom which is to last for ever. Such is the hour, such are the events, which you are to commemorate in the Sacrament of our Lord Supper. I thall attempt to set them before you as proper fubjeas, at this time, of your devout meditation. To display them in their genuine majefly, is beyond the ability of man.

I. THIS was the hour in which Christ was glorified by his fufferings. The whole of his life had discovered much real greatness, under a mean appearance.
Through the cloud of his humiliation, his native lustre often broke, forth; but never did it ihine so bright, as in this last, this trying hour. It was indeed the hour of distress, and of blood. He knew it to , ER  bg such; and when he uttered the words  of jhe Text, he had before his eyes, the executioner and the cross, the scourge, the nails, and the spear. But by profpeds of this .nature his foiu was not to be over.
come. It is distress which ennobles every great charaacer; and distress was to glo, rify the Son of God. He was pow to teach all mankind, by his exampJe, how to fuffer and to die. He was to fland forth before his enemies, as the faithful witness of the truth; jultifying by his behavioir the charader which he assumed, and sealing with his blood the dodtrine which he taught."
"What magnanimity in all his words and ations on this great occafioo! The court of Herod, the judgement-hall of Pilate, the hil of Calvary, were fb pany -theatres prepared for his displaying all the virtues of a constant and patient mind."
"When led forth to fuffer, the first voice which we hear from him, is a generous lamentation over the fate of his unfortupate, though guilty, country; and, to the last noment of his jife, we 1ehol4 hip.in poffeffiop of the faap gentle and benevolept spirit, No upbraiding, 09 cqpnplaining expression escaped from his lips, during the long and painful approaches of a ,rPl death. He betrayed no symptom qs a weal or a vulgar, of a difcoxmgfed or impatient mind. tjt the utmqpt tttpntjai of filial tepderrefs, he committed his aged mother to the care of hi* beloved disciple *. With all jhe dignity of a SoYereign, ,he coiferred pardon qn a pei ;ent fellow-fufferer. With a greatness of Piqid beyond example, he spent his, last niqrments in apologies and prayers, for lhofe who were tEedding his blood."
"lýy ,wonders in heaven, and wonders on earth, was this hour distinguished, All nature seemed to feel it ; and the degd and the living bore witness to its importance, The reil of the temple was rent in twain."
"The earth shook. There was darkness over all the land. The graves were opened, and many whoflept arose and went into *See John xix. 26, 27, "
"the Holy City. Nor were these the only  prodigies of this awful hour. The most hardened hearts were subdued and changed. The Judge, who in order to gratify the multitude passed sentence against him, publickly attested his innocence. The Roman centurion, who presided at the execution, glorifed God, and acknowledged the fufferer to be more than man. After he saw the things which had pafed, he said, Certainly this was a righteous perfoi ; truly, this was the Son of God. The Jewish malefador who was crucified with him, addressed him as a King, and implored his favour, Even the crowd of insensible fpeftators, who had come forth as to a common fpedacle, and who began with clamours and insults, returned home, smiting their breafs.-Look back on the heroes, the philosophers, the legislators of old. View them in their last moments."
"Recall every circumstance which diftinguifled their departure from the world."
"Where can you find such an assemblage of high virtues, and of great events, as con curred at the death ofChrift? Where, fb "
"many teflimonies given to the dignity of  the dying person, by earth, 'and by heaven ?"
"II. THIS was the hour in which Christ atoned for the fins of mankind, ind accomplifhed our eternal redemption. It was the hour when that great sacrifice was offered up, the efficacy of which reaches back to the first transgression of man, and extends forward to the end of time; the hour when, from the cross, as from an high altar, that blood was flowing, which washed away the guilt of the nations."
"This awful dispensation of the Al mighty, contains mysteries which are beyond the discovery of ,man. It is one of those things into which the angels desire to look. What has been revealed to us, is, That the death of Christ was the interpofition of Heaven for preventing the ruin of human kind. We know, that under the government of God, misery is the natural consequence of guilt. After rational ER  preaturts had, by their criminal condu&~"
". - introduced difpr4pe iito the Divine kingr dorp, there waq no ground to believe, tha4 by their penitence and prayers alone, they could prevent the deftrution which threateped them. The prevalence of propitiatory a[crifices throughout Ihp earth, proclaims it to be the general sense of mankind, that mere repentance was not of fufficient avail to expiate fin, or ;Q (lop its pepal effeas. By the conflant allusions which are carried on in the New Testament to the sacrifices under the Law, as prg-fignifying a great atone."
"ment made by Christ; and by the strong ecpreflions which are used in describing the effeas of his death, the sacred writers jhow, as plainly as language allows, that there was an efficacy in his fufferings, far beyond that of mere example and infiruatio. The nature and extent of that efficacy we are unable, as yet, fully to, trace. ,Part we are capable of beholding; and the wisdom of what we behold, we have reason to adore. We discern in this plan of redemption, the evil of fin lrongly exhibited; and the justice of the ."
"Divine government awfully exemplified, in Christ fuffering for sinners. But let us not imagine, that our present disco."
"veries unfold the whole influence of the death of Christ. It is conneaed with causes into which we cannot penetrate."
"It produces consequences too extensive for us to explore. God thoughts are not as our thoughts. In all things, we fe only in part; and here, if any where, we fee also as through a gla  darkly."
"This, however, is fully manifest, that redemption is one of the most glorious works of the Almighty. If the hour of the creation of the world was great and illustrious; that hour, when, from the dark and formless mafe, this fair fyflem of nature arose at the Divine command; when the morning flarsfang together, and all the Jfns qs God ]houted for joy ; no efs illustrious is the hour qs the reftration of the world; the hour when, from coQn depnation and misery, it emerged Into SE RM . happiness and peace. With less external ._. majefly it was attended, but is, on that account, the more wonderful, that under an appearance so simple, fuch'great events were covered."
"III. IN this hour, the long series of prophesies, visions, types, and figure6, was accomplished. This was the center in which they all met: This the point, towards which they had tended and verged, throughout the course of so many generations. You behold the Law and the Prophets flanding, if we may speak so, at the foot of the cross, and doing homage.. You behold Moses and Aaron bearing the ark of the covenant-; David and Elijah presenting the oracle of teffimony. You behold all the priests and sacrifices, all the rites and ordinances, all the types and symbols, assembled together to receive their consummation."
"Without the death of Christ, the worship and ceremonies of the law 'would have remained a pompous, but unmeaning in "
"flitution. In the hour when he was cru- "
"cified, the book with the seven seals was opened. Every rite assumed its fignificancy; every prediaion met its event; every symbol displayed its correspond "
"The dark, and seemingly ambiguous method of conveying important difcoveries under figures and emblems, was not peculiar to the sacred books. The Spirit of God, in pre-fignifying the death of Christ, adopted that plan, according to which the whole knowledge of those early ages was propagated through the world. Under the veil of mysterious allusion, all wisdom was then concealed."
"From the sensible world, images were every where borrowed, to describe things unseen. More was underitood to be meant, than was openly expressed. By enigmatical rites, the Priest communicated his do&rines; by parables and allegories, the Philosopher inftru his disciples ; even the Legislator, by figurative sayings, commanded the reverence of the people. Agreeably to'this prevalt , mode of inftru&ion, the whole difL penfation of the Old Teflament was so conduaed, as to be the shadow and the figure of a spiritual fyflem. Every remarkable event, every distinguished perm fonage, under the Law, is interpreted in the New Testament, as bearing some reference to the hour of which we treat."
"If Isaac was laid upon the altar as an innocent viaim; if David was driven from his throne by the wicked, and restored by the hand of God; if the brazen serpent was lifted up, to heal the people; if the rock was smitten by Moses, to furnith drink in the wilderness; all were types of Christ, and alluded to his death."
"In prediaing the fame event, the han guage of ancient prophecy was magnificent, but feeringly contradi&ory: For it foretold a Messiah, who was to be at once a fufferer and a conqueror. The Star was to come rut of facvb, and the Branch to fprifg from theflem of Jee. The/ngel of the Covrnawt, tbh Deefre ofall Tations, was to Mfe fuddedty to his ten~ple; arid to htli "
"*Wa td be te gathering of people. Yet at the fame time, he Was to be despised and  eted of inen; he wds tb be taken froih prifoft nd from judgment, and to be led as hrib to tbflattghtet. Though he Was A ~ah of orrows and acquainted with griefý yet the Gentiles were to come to his light, dfid kings to the brightness of is riing. In thd hour when Christ died, those prophetical riddles were solved; those seeming contradidtions were reconciled. The obrcurity of oracles, and the ambiguity of types vanished. The Sun of righteousness rose; and, together with the dawfn of religion, those shadows passed away."
"IV. THIS was the hour of the abolition of the Law, and the introdu&ion of the Gospel; the hour of terminating the old, and of beginning the new dispensation of religious knowledge and worship, throughout the eairth. Viewed it. this light, it forms the most august sera which is to be founa in the history of mankind. When ERI . Chrifl was fuffering on the crbfs, wve are I . informed by one of the Evangelists, that he said, I thirf ; and that they filled a fpunge ,with vinegar, and put it to his mouth."
",After he bad tafled the vinegar, knowing that all things were now accomplJhed, and the scripture fufilled, he Jaid, It isflni/bed* ; that is, This offered draught of vinegar was the last circumitance predited by an ancient Prophet  that remained tq be fulfilled. The vision and the prophecy are now sealed: The Mofaick dispensation is closed. And he bowed his head, an4 gave up the ghost."
"It is fni/qed.-When he uttered these words, he changed the state of the universe. At that moment, the Law ceased, and the Gospel commenced. This was the ever-memorable point of time, which feparated the old and the new world from each other. On one of the point oJ teparation, you behold the Law, with its priests, its sacrifices, and its rites, retiring from fight. On the other  you be *Joha xix. z8S 29, 30. Pfa. lxix. 2 ."
"hold she Gospel, with its simple and- ve- sE 8. Mt nerable iniftitutions, coming forward, into view. 'Significantly was the veil of the temple rent in this hour; for the glory then departed fromi between the cherubims."
"The legal High Priest delivered, up his Urim and Thummim, his breast-plate, his robes, and his incense i And CHRIsti flood forth as the Great' High Priest of all succeeding generations. By- that ond facrifice which he now offered, he abolished sacrifices for ever. Altars on which the fire had blazed for ages, 'were n6w tb fmokb no more. Vitims were no more to bleed."
"Not with the blood of bulls and goats, but 'rith his own blood, he now entered into the Holy Place, there to appear in the presence of God for us."
"This was the hour of association and union to all. the worshippers of God."
"When Christ said, It zi'fnJhed, he threw down the wall of partition which had so long divided the Gentile from the Jew."
"HI gathered into one, all the faithful, out 6f every kindred and people. He pro 

fEt  ~laimed the hour to'be come,- whern the  knowledge of the true God should be Ab longer confined to one nation, nor his wrship to. one temple; but over all the earth, the worshippers of the Father should free kiiz in firit and in truth. From'that hour, they who dwelt in the uttermojl ends of the earth, frangers to the covenant of promise, began to. be, brought nighi In that hour, the light of the Gospel dawned from afar on the British islands.

During a long course of ages, Provi dence seemed to be occupied in preparing the world for this revolution. The whole Jewish ceconomy was intended to usher it in. The knowledge of God was preserved unextingtifhed in one corner of the world, ttait thence, in due time, might issue forth the light which -was to overspread the earth. Successive revelations gradually enlarged the views of men beyond the narrow bounds of Judaea, to a more extenive kingdom of God. Signs and miracles awakened their expedation, and direaed their eyes towards this great event. Whe

ijounfain, pr fpokg by the Prophet voice; whether be feattered his chosen people into .aptivity, or re-assembled them in their owA land; he was still carrying on a progreffive plan, which was accomplished at the death of Christ.
\ Not only in' the territories of lfrael, but over all.the earth, the great difpenfations of Proyidence refpeaed the approach of this important hour. If empires rose or fell if. war divided, or peace united the nations; if learning civilized their manners, or philosophy enlarged their views; all was, by the secret decree of Heaven, made to ripen the world for ,that fulness of time, when Christ was to publish the whole counsel of God. The Persian, the Macedonian, the Roman Conqueror, entered upon the sage, each at his predited period ; and, though he meant not so, neither did his heart think so, ministered to his hour. The revolutions of power, and -the fuccefflon of monarchies, were fa ar.,,anged by Providence,' as .to facilitate the  2 progress SsE  progress of th6 Gospel through the habil, _i able world, after the day had arrived, 
'when the flone which was cut out of ,
mountain without hands, fIould become a great mountain, and fil the earth *. This -was the day, Iwhich Abraham saw afar of, and was glad. This was the day, which many Prophets and Kings, and righteoul men, desired to fee, but could not ; the day for which the earnefl expetlation of the creaTure, long oppressed with ignorance, and bewildered in fuperfition, might be justly said to wait.
  THis was the hour of ChrifP triumph over all the powers of darkness;,
the hour in which he overthrew dominions and ' thrones, led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. The contest which the kingdom of darkness had long maintained against the kingdom of light, was now brought to its crisis. The period was come, when the feed of the woman Jhould bruise the head of the serpent. For many  * Dan,  34, 35 ages, the most gross fuperflition had filled ) a the earth. The glory of the uncorruptible God was every where, except in the land of Judsea, changed into images made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and beafs, pnd creeping things, The world, which the Almighty created for himself, seemed to have become a temple of idols. Even to vices and passions, altars were raised; and what was intitled Religion, was in effec a discipline of impurity. In the midst of this universal darkness, Satan had.
ereted his throne; and the learned and poliihed, as well as the savage nations, bowed down before him. But at the hour when Christ appeared on the cross, the signal of his defeat was given. His kingdom suddenly departed from him ; the reign of Idolatry passed away: He was beheld tofall like lightning from heaven. In that hour, the foundation of every Pagan temple shook. The statue of every salsa God tottered on its base. The Priest fled from his falling ihrine; and the Heathen oracles became dumb for ever.

SE ,i- . As on the cross Christ triumphed oviel Satan, so he overcame his auxiliary, thl world. Long had it assailed him with ita temptations and difcouragements. In thie hour of severe trial, he surmounted them ill. Formerly he had despised the pleaJ fures of the world. He now baffled itý terrours. Hence he is justly said to have crucified the world. By his fufferingsi he ennobled diflrefs; and he darkened the lustre of the pomp and vanities -of life. He discovered to his followers thb path which leads, through affli&ion, to glory and to vicory; and he imparted to them the fame spirit which enabled him to overtome. My kingdom is not of this world. In this world ye Jfhall have tribulation : -But be of good cheer; I have overcome the world *."
"Death also, the last foe of man, 'was the viaim of this hour. The formidable appearance of the fpe&re remained; but his dart was taken away, For, intha . hpur when Christ expiated guilt, he dif, "
"armed death, by securing the refurre-ion RM."
"of the just. When he said to his peni tent fellow-fufferer, To-day thou Jhalt be with me in paradise, he announced to all his followers the certainty of heavenly bliss. He declared, the cherubims to be."
"difnriffed, and the flaming sword to be fheathed, which had been appointed at the fall, to keep from man the way of the Tree. of life *. Faint, before this period, had been the hope, indiftina the profped, which egen good men enjoyed of the ,heavenly kingdom. Life and immortality were now brought to light. From the hill of Calvary, the first clear and certain view. was given to the world of the everJaftiog, mansions. Since that hour, they ahave been the perpetual consolation of believers in Christ. Under trouble, they looth their minds ; amidst temptation, thley support their virtue; and, in their .dying,moments, enable them to fay, 0 ,Deaqh ! where is thy fling? 0 Grave !"

"S RJ.  THIS was the hour when our Lord ..... erected that spiritual kingdom which is never to end. How vain are the counfela and designs of mei! How thallow is the policy of the wicked! How ahort their triumphing !. The enemies of Christ imagined, that in this hour they had fucceftik fully accomplished their plan for .his  ilruaion. They believed, that they had entirely scattered the small party of his followers, and had extinguilhed his namel and his honour for' ever. In derision, they addressed him as a King. They clothed him with purple robes; - they crowned him with a crown of thorns; they put a med into his hand; and, with insulting mockery, bowed the knee before'"
"him. Blind and impious men! How little did they know, that the Almighty was at that moment setting him as a King on the hill of Sion; giving him the Heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermoJ parts of the earth for his pofflion ! How little did they know, that their badges of mock royalty were at that moment ton verted into the signals of absolute domi- "

"power! The reed which they put into his hands, became a rod of iron, with which he was to break in pieces his enen-ies a sceptre, with which he was to rule the universe in righteousness. The cross, which they thought Was to stigmatize him with infamy, became the ensign of his renown. Instead of being the reproach of his followers, it was to be their boast and their glory. The cross was to fbine on palaces and churches, throughout the earthi It was to be assumed as the distinction of the most powerful monarchs, and to wave in the banner of victarious armies, when the memory of Herod and Pilate should be accursed; when -Jerusalem thould be reduced to ashes, and the Jews be Vagabonds over all the world."
"These were the triumphs which com menced at this hour. Our Lord saw them already in their birth he Jaw of the travail of his foul, and was fatisjed."

He beheld the Gentiles waiting below the cross, to   ceive the Gospel. He beheld Ethispia and the Isles Jfretching out their hands t4 God; the defart beginning to rejoice, and to blofom as the lose ; and the knowledge of ths Lord filling the earth, as the *waters cove the sea.

It was the plrformance of the mercy promied to the fathers. We behold the consummation of a great plan, which, throughout a course of ages, had been uniformly pursued; and which, against every- human appearance, was, at the appointed moment, exa6tly fulfilled. No word that is gone out of the mouth of the Lord, Jhall fail No length of time alters his purpose. No obitacles can retard it. Towards the ends accomplished in this hour, the noft repugnant instruments were made to operate4 We discern God bending to his purpose, the jarring paflions, the opposite interests, and even the vices of men; uniting seeming 'contrarieties in his scheme; making the zwrath of man to praiJ 'him; obliging the ambition of Princes, the prejudices of the Jews, the ER  malice of Satan, all to concur, eithevii ---,' bringing forward this hour, or ih cdi pleting its destined effects.

LASTLY, The consideration of this whole fubjet tends to excite gratitude and devotion, when we approach to God in ads of worship. The hour of which I have discoursed, presents him to us in the amiable light of the Deliverer of mankind,'

By such views of the Divine nature, Christian faith lays the foundation for a worship which shall be at once rational and affectionate; a worship, in which the light of the undeftladfng flall concur with the devotion ol heart, and the most profound rever united with the most cordial love. Christian faith is not a system of speculative truths. It is not a lesson of moral inftrution only. By a train of high discoveries which it reveals, by a succession ofintereffing obje6s which it places in our view, it is calculated to elevate the mind, to purify the affeaions, and, by the assistance of devotion, to confirm and encourage virtue. Such, in particular, is the scope of that divine inftitution, the Sacrament of our Lord Supper. To this happy purpose let it conduce, by concentering, in one striking point of light, all that the Gospel has flif  played of what is most important to man.

Touched with just contrition for pait offences, and filled with a grateful sense of Divine goodness, let us come to the altar of God; and, with a humble faith in his infinite mercies, devote ourselves to his service for ever.



# SERMON  On Gentleness.

The wisdom that is from above, is-gentle be wife in our own eyes, to be wife in the opinion of the world, 
and to be wife in the fight of God, are three things so very different, as rarely to coincide. One may often be wife in his own eyes, who is far from being f6 in the judgment of the world; and to be reputed a prudent man by the world, is no security for being accounted wife by God.
As there is a worldly happiness, which God perceives to be no other than difguised misery; as there are worldly ho-,
nours, which in his estimation are reproach; so there is a worldly wisdom,  . which, in bis fight, isfoolyij7nefs. Of this worldly wisdom the charaders are given in the co'ntext, and placed in contrast with those of the wisdom which is from above.
The one is the wisdom of 'the crafty; the other, that of the upright. The one terminates in felfilhnefs ; the other, in charity. The one is full of frife and bitter envyings; the other, of mercy- and of good fruits. One of the chief chara6ters by which the wisdom from above is diftinguifhed, is gentleness, of which I am now to discourse. Of this there is thU greater occasion to discourse, because it is too seldom viewed in a religious light; and is more readily considered by the bulk of men, as a mere felicity of nature, br an exterior accomplishment of manners, than as a Christian virtue which they are bound to cultivate. I ihall first explain the nature of this virtue; and shall then offer some arguments to recommend, and some direaions to facilitate, the pradice of it.

I BtGIN with dilfinguiflhing trud gen tlenffs fkdm passive tameness of spirit, and, froi Utnlimited compliance with the manners of others. That pamive tameness which submits, without firuggle, to every inctoachtnent of the violent and asfuming, forms no part of Christian duty; but, ori the contrary, is deftruaive of general happiness and order. That uhliinited complaisance, which, on every occafion, falls in with the opinions and manners of others, is so fat from being a virtue, that it is itself a vice, and the patent of many vices. It overthrows all fleadinefs bs principle; and produces that sinful conformity with the world, which taints the whole charater. In the present corrupted slate of human manners, always to assent and to comply, is the very worst maxim we can adopt. It is impossible to support the purity and dignity of Christian morals, without oppofing thd world on various occasions, even though we should fland alone. That gentleness therefore which belongs to vir 


 tue, is to be carefully distinguished from ' the mean spirit of cowards, and the fawnS assent of sycophants. It renounces no just right from fear. It gives up no important truth from flattery. It is 
deed not only consistent with a firm mind, but it necessarily requires a manly spirit, and a fixed principle, in order to give it any real value. Upon this solid ground only, the polilh of gentleness can with advantage be fuperinduced.

It flands opposed, not to the most termined regard for virtue and truth, but to harshness and severity, to pride and arrogance, to violence and oppression.
It is, properly, that part of the great 'virtue of charity, which makes us unwilling to give pain to any of our brethren. Compaflion prompts us to relieve their wants. Forbearance prevents us from retaliating their injuries. Meekness restrains our angry passions; candour, our Tevere judgments. Gentleness correts whatever is offenfive in our manners, and, by a conflant train of humane at 
tentiond, fludies to alleviate the burden SE 


of common misery. Its office, therefore, '
is eKtenfive. It is not, like some other virtues, I called forth only on peculiar emergencies; but it is continually in action% Vwhen' we are engaged in intercourse with men. It' ought to form our address, to regulafe our speech, and to diffufe itfelt over our whole behaviour.

I must warn you, however, not to confound this gentle wisdom which from abowe, with that artificial courtesy, that studied smoothness of manners, which is learned in the school of the world. Such accompli.hments, the most frivoldus and empty may possess. Too often they are employed by the artful, as a snare; too often affeCted by the hard and unfeeling, as a cover to the baseness of their minds. We cannot, at the fame time, avoid observing the homage, which, even in such inflances, the world is conflrained to pay to virtue. In order to render focietjr agreeable, it is found peceffary to assume somewhat, that may at  least carry its appearance. Virtue is thq  universal charm. Even its fha4dw is coursed, when the fubflance is wanting&
The imitation of its form has been wse duced into an art; and, in the commerce of life, the first fludy of all, who wpuwld either gain the esteem, or win the harts of others, is to learn the speech, and to adopt the manners, of candour, genltle ners, and humanity. Iut that geptlenefs which is the charateriftickl of a, good man, has, like every other vixtue, its feat in the heart; And, let me add, non thing except what flows from the bearmt can render even external manners truly pleasing. For no assumed behaviour. can at 'all times hide the real' charafter. In, that unaffeded civility which fpiings from a gentle mind, there is a, charm infinitely more powerful, 'than in all the fludied manners of the most finifbed True genjlenefs is founded on a sense of wtiat we owe to him who made us, and to the common nature of which we all hare. It arises from refletQon on our own failiigs and wants; and from just 
views of the condition, and the duty of man. It is native feeling, heightened and idiproved by principle., ft is the heart which easily relents; which feefs for every thing hat is fiuta  indc is backward mtd flow to infli& the least wound.

It' exerdifes' authority wikft moderation adminiftes reproof with tenderness; donfers favours with ealfe and' modefty. It is unassuming in opinion, and'"
"temperate ihW zeal.' It contendS not eagerly alobt trifles; ilow t6conit'rad and'"
"'still flower to blaine; but prompt to allay dissention, arid to rditord' peace. It neiffleF intettheddles' nrieedflarily with the affairs, nor pries inquisitively into the secrets, of others; ft delights 'above all things to alleviate distress, and, if it can "
"S  not dry up the falling tear, to o9pth, at VL. least the grieving heart. Where it has not the power of being useful, it js neyr burdenfonie.. It seeks to please, ;athej than to thine and dazzle; and conqeal with care that superiority, either q9 talents, or of rank, which is oppressive t4 those who are beneath it. In a word, i is that spirit, and that tenour of mannersy which the gospel of Christ enjoins, when it commands us to bear one another burdens; to rejoice with those who -rejoice, and to weep with those who weep; topleafe."
"every one his neighbour for his good; to be kind and tender-hearted;, to be pitiful and courteous; to Jupport the weak, and to be patient towards all men."
"Having now fufficiently explained the mature of this amiable virtue, I proceed to rpcommend it to your practice. Let me, for this end, desire you to confider the duty which you owe to Godl to confider the relation which you bear to oge another; to confider your own interest."
"I. CONSIDER the duty which you owe to God. When you survey his works, nothing is so conspicuous, as his greatness and majesty. When you'confult his word, nothing is more remarkable, than his attention to fofteti that greatness, and to place it in the mildest and least oppressive light. He not only charaterizes himself as the God of consolation, but, with condescending gentleness, he particularly accommodates himself to the situation of the unfortunate. 1e dwelleth 'with the humible and contrite. He hideth not his face when the affliced cry. lie bealeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.-When his Son came to be the Saviour of the world, he was eminent for the fame attribute of mild and gentle goodness. Long before his birth, it was prophesied of him, that he should not firive, nor cry, nor cause his voice to be heard in the Jreets; that the bruised reed he Jhould not break, nor quench the fioking flax*: And after his death, this SMatth. xii. 19, 20."
"'s 9  difiinguifhing feature in his charater was  SLtfo universally remembered, that the Apofýle Paul, on occasion of a request which he, makes to the Corinthians, uses those red markable expressions *, I beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Chrifl. Daring all his intercourse with mieht no harfhnefi or pride, or stately distance, appeated' if his demeanour. In his access, he was eafy in, his manners,, simple; in his an~swers,."
"mild; ia his whole behaviour; humble and, obliging. Learn of me,, said hi sot I an meek and lowly in heart.--Ars the Son God is the pattern, to the Holy Ghofit is the inspires of gentleness, His name is the Comforter, the Spirit of grace and peace."
"His fruits, or operations on the hinman mind, are love, meekness, gentleness, and lbngfuffering -Thus, by every discovery of the Godhead, honour is conferred upon gentleness. It is held' up to 6  View, ar peculiarly conneted with Celeffial Nature."
"And suitable to such discoveries, is the whole firain of the Gospel. It were unnecessary to * Cor.  i. Gal.  22."
"appeal to any single precept. You need "
"only open the New Tefiament, to find this ty virtue perpetually inculcated. Charity, or love is thd capital figure ever presented i eout vrew; and gentlernefs, forbearanceand forgiveness, are the founds ever re eurrirrg on our ear."
"So predominant, indeed, is this fpiril throughout the Christian dispensation, that even the vices and corruptions of men. have not been able altogether to defeat its tendency. Though that edifpenfation is far from having hithert6 produced' its full effet upon the word, yet we can clearly trace its influence, humanizing the manners o4 men. Remarkable, in this refpe6t, is the viapry whici it has gained over those powers of violence and cruelty, which belong to the infernal kingdom. Wherever Chriaianity prevails, it has discouraged, and, in fomen degfee, abolithed slavery. It lhas rescued human nature from that ignominious yoke, under which, in former ages, the one halfi of mankind groaned. It has  introduced more equality between the tw%

YI, sexes, and rendered the conjugal uniou, 
more rational and happy. It has abatedc the ferocioufnefs of war. It has mihi, gated the rigour of despotism, mitigate[
the cruelty of punishments; -in a words has reduced mankind, from thejir ancient barbarity, into a more humane and gentle slate.- Do we pretend re(pea and zeal for this religion, and at the fame time, allow ourselves in that harfhnefs,and feve, rity, which are so contraditory to its get nius ? Too plainly we show,, that it has no, power over our hearts. We may retain the Christian name; but we have abandoned the Christian spirit, r  CONsIDaR the relation whicl yo0, 
bear to one another. .Man, as a solitary individual, is a very wretched being.,
As long as he flands detached from his kind, he is poffeffed, neither of happinefl, nor of firength. We are formed by na-,
ture to unite; we are impelled towards each other, by the compassionate inftinas in our frame; we are linked by a thou-  
sand -connetions, founded on common wants. Gentleness therefore, or, as it is very properly termed, humanity, is what mari, as such, in every flation, owes to ntan To be inaccessible, contemptuous, and hard of heart, is to revolt against our own nature; is, in the language of scripture, to hide ourselves from our own flieh. Accordingly, as all feel the claim which they have. to mildness and humanity, so all are sensibly hurt by the want of it in others. On no are we more vulnerable. No complaint is more feelingly made, than that of the harlh and rugged manners of persons with whom we, have intercourse. But how seldom do we transfer the cafe to ourselves, or examine how far we are guilty of infliting on others, whose sensibility is the fame with ours, those very wounds of which we so loudly complain ?

But, perhaps, it will be pleaded by some, That this gentleness, on which we now insist, regards only those smaller offices of life, which in their eye aIe  - not essential to religion and goodthef Negligent, they confers, on flight occat fions, of the government of their temer, or the regulation of their behaviour, they are attentive, as they pretend, to the great duties of beneficence; and feady, whenever the opportunity presents, t6 perform important services to their fellow-creatures. But let such persons reflet that the occasions of performing those important good deeds, very rarely occur. Perhaps their situation in life, or the nature of their conneaions, may in a great measure exclude them from such opportunities. Great events give scope for great virtues; but the main tenOur human life, is composed of small occirt rences. Within the round of these, lie the materials of the happiness of most men; the fubjets of their duty, and the trials of their virtue. Virtue must be formed and supported, not by unfrequent aas, but by daily and repeated exertions. In order to its becoming either vigorous or useful, it must be habitually aaive; not breaking forth occailonally with 
a transient lufire, like the blaze of the conmet; but regular in its returns, like the light of day: Not like the aromatic gale, which sometimes fears the sens  but like the prdinary breeze, vwhich purifies the air, and renders it healthful.

Years may pass over our heads, with out affording any- opportunity for ads of high beneficence, or extensive utility.
Whereas not a day paiffs, but in the common tranfaaions of life, and efpecially in tlh intercourse of domeflic society, gentleness finds place for promoting the happiness of others, and for strengthening in ourselves the habit of virtue. Nay, by seasonable discoveries of a humane spirit, we sometimes contribute more materially to the advancement of happiness, than by aations which are seemingly more important. There are situations, not a few, in human lifeI where the encouraging reception,' the condescending behaviour, and the look.


of sympathy, bring greater relief to the  cc heart, than the most bountiful gift. While, 
on the other  when the hand of liberality is extended to bestow, the want of gentleness is fufficient to frustrate the intention of the benefit. We four those * whom we meant to bblige; and, by con ferring favours with ostentation and harshness, we convert them into injuries. Can any disposition then be held to possess a low place in the scale of .virtue, whose influence is so considerable on the happinets of the world ?

Gentleness is, in truth, the great ave nue to mutual enjoyment. AmidfP the firife of interfering interests, it tempers the violence of contention, and keeps alive the feeds of harmony. It softens animofities; renews endearments; and renders the countenance of man, a refrefhment to man. Banish gentleness from the earth; suppose the world to be filled with none but harsh and contentious spirits; and what fort of society would remain ? The solitude of the defart were preferable to it. The conflia of jarring lenwents in chaos the cave, where sub- 4---. ferraneous winds contend and roar; the den, where serpents hiss, and beasts of the forest howl; would be the only proper representations of such assemblies of men.
-0 that I had wings like a dove ! for.then Itwouldfly away, and be at ref. Lo ! then I would wander far of, and remain in the wilderness; I would haqfen my escape from the windy florm and tempef : For I havs seen violence and flrife in the city. Mifchief and sorrow are in the midst of it Deceit and guile depart not from the fJreet *.
-Strange! that where men have all one common interest, they should so often, absurdly, concur in defeating it! Has not Nature already provided a fufficient quantity of unavoidable evils for the slate of man ? As if we did not fuffer enough from the florm which beats upon us without, must we conspire also, in those societies where we assemble, in order to find a retreat from that storm, to harass one ano 



 ther ?-But if the sense of duty, and of --  common happiness, be infufficient to re*

commend the virtue of which,we treat, then let me desire you, 
III. To confider your own interef.

Whatever ends a good man can be supposed to pursue, gentleness will be founl to favour them. It prepoffeffes and wins every heart. It persuades, when ever other argument fails; often disarms the fierce, and melts the flubborn, Whereas harshness confirms the opposition it would subdue; and, of an indifferent perfoa, creates an enemy. He who could overlook an injury committed in the collision of interests, will long and severely resent the flights of a contemptuous behaviour.-
To the man ofgentlenefs, the world is generally disposed to ascribe every other gool , quality. The higher endowments of the mind we admire at a distance; and whe any impropriety of behaviour accompanies them,. we admire without love. They.arq like some of the distant flars, whose bene, 
ficaalinfluence reaches not to us. Where- I.  of the influence of gentleness, all in 
frme degree partake, and therefore all love it. The man of this charader rises in the world without struggle, and flourishes without envy. His misfortunes are univerfally lamented; and his failings are easily forgiven."
"But whatever may be the effet of this virtue on our external condition, its "
"fluence on our internal enjoyment is certain and powerful. That inward tran-tuillity which it promotes, is the sirs tequifite to every pleasurable feeling. It is the calm and clear atmosphere, the ferenity and sun-shine of the mind. Wherl benigiity and gentleness reign within, we are always least in hazard of being rufled from without; every person, and evefr occurrence, are beheld in the most favourable light. But let some clouds of disgust and ill-humour gather oh the mind; and immediately the scene change'"
"Nature seems transfdrmed; and the appearance of all things is blackened to out  view.' The gentle mind is like the smooth *---' fiream, which reflets every objet iii Itt juit proportion, and in its fairest colourk The violent spirit, like troubled waters, renders back the images of things diftoried ,and broken; and communicates to them all, that disordered motion which arise solely from its own agitation."
"Offences muji come. As soon may the waves of the sea cease to roll, as provo-."
"cations to arise from human corruption and frailty. Attacked by great injuries, the man of mild and gentle spirit will feel what human nature feels; and will defend and resent, as his duty allows lim."
"But to those flight provocations, and frivolous offences, which are the most frequent causes of disquiet, he is happily fuperiour.- Hence his days flow in a far more placid tenour than those of others i exempted from the numberless difcom*"
"pofures which agitate vulgar minds. Inspired with higher sentiments; taught to regard, with indulgent eye, the frailties of men, . the omissions ps the' careless, the follies of the imprudent, and the levity of the fickle, he retreats into the calmnels of his spirit, as into an undisturbed fanCuary.; and quietly allows the usual current of life to hold its course."
"This virtue has another, and flill more important connetion with our interest, by means of that relation which our present behaviour bears to our eternal state."
"Heaven is the region of gentleness -and friendship; Hell, of fierceness and animofity. If then, as the scripture, inftruts .us, according to what we now sow, we mztfl hereafter reap ; it follows, that the cultivation of a gentle temper is necessary to prepare us for heavenly felicity; and that the indulgence of harsh dispositions, -is the introducion to future misery. Men, I am afraid, too often separate those articles of their belief which relate to eternity, from'the ordinary affairs of the world."
"They conned them with the seasons of seriousness and gravity. They leave ther with much refpec, as in a high region, to which, only on great occasions, they common life, eonfider themselves- a1 liberty to' give free feope to their humour and passions. Whereas, in fa&, it is theft behaviour in the daily train of social in*"
"tercourfe, which, more than any othli cause, fixes and determines their fpiritdal charater; gradually inflilling thofo di4t positions, and forming those habits, 1whic affeat their everlasting condition. With -regard to trifles, perhaps, their malignant dispositions may chiefly be indulged."
"%3ut let them remember well, that those trifles, by increasing the growth of pei."
"vifhnefs and passion, become pregnant with the most serious 'mifchiefs; and may fit them, before they are aware, for being the future companions of none bat infernal spirits."
"I mean not to fay, that in order to our preparation for Heaven, it is enough to be mild and gentle or that this virtUi olone, will cover all our fins. Through the felicity of natural eonflitution, a Cetain degree of this benignity may be pes sessed by some, whose hearts are in' ether refpeas corrupt, and their lives irregular."
"jBut what I mean to assert, is, That where no jatteption is given to the government .qs temper, meetnefs for Heaven is not yet acquired, and the regenerating, power of religion is as yet unknown. One of the first works of the Spirit of God, is, to infuse into every heart which it inhabits, that gentle wisdom which is from above. They who are Chrif  have crucifed the ftefh, with its affeFions and luffs; but let it not be forgotten, that among the works of the feJh, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, flrife, and envyings, are as expressly enumerated, as uncleanness, murders, drunkenness, and revelling *."
"They who continue either in the one or the other, Jhall not inherit, indeed cannot inherit, the kingdom of God."
"Having thus shown the importance of gentleness, both as a moral virtue, and as a Christian grace, I thall conclude thr fibjeC, with briefly suggesting some cod  Gal. . 19, 20, 21. 


fiderations which may be of tife to facit  li tate the pradice of it.

FOR this end, let me advise you to view your charater with an' impartial eyeý and to learn, from your own failings, to give that indulgence which in your turn you claim. It is pride which fills the world with so much harshness and feve-'
rity. In the fulness of felf-eftimation, we forget what we are. We claim attentions, to which we are not entitled. We are rigorous to offences, as if we had never offended; unfeeling to distress, as if we knew not what it was to fuffer. Fromr those airy regions of pride and folly, let us descend to our proper level. Let us survey the natural equality on which Providence has placed man with man, and reflet on the infirmities common to all, If the reflection on natural equality and mutual offences be infufficient to prompt kumanity, let us at leafs remember what Vve are in the fight of God. Have wp apne of that forbearance to give to one another, which we all so earnestly intreat $ 


from Heaven ? Can we look for clemency or gentleness from our Judge, when we are so backward to show it to our own brethren ?

Accustom yourselves, also, to reflet on the finall moment of those things which are the usual incentives to violence and contentidn. In the ruffled and angry hour, we view every appearance through a false medium. The most inconsiderable point of interest, or' honour, swells into a momentous objeat; and the slightest attack seems to threaten immediate ruin.
But after passion or pride has subsided, we look round in vain for the mighty mifchiefs we dreaded. The fabric, which our disturbed imagination had reared, totally disappears. But though the cause of contention has dwindled away, its consequences remain. We have alienated a friend; we have embittered an enemy; *we have sown the feeds of future fufpTion, malevolence, or disgust.- Suspend your Violence, I beseech you, for a mo StE I , ment, when causes of discord oecur. 4n i- ticipate that period of coolness, which, of itself, will soon arrive. Allow yourfqlves to think, how little you have any profpe4 of gaining by fierce contention; but how much of the true happiness of life you are certain of throwing away., Easily, and from the smallest chink, the bitter waters of strife are let forth; but their course cannot be foreseen; and he seldom fails of fuffering most from their poifonou§
effea, who firfl allowed them to flow, 
But gentleness will, most of all, be pro.

moted by frequent views of those great objets which our holy religion presents.
Let the profpeds of immortality fill your minds. Look upon this world as a ftatq of passage. Confider yourselves as engaged in the pursuit of higher interests as acing now, under the eye of God, an introdu&ory part to a more important scene. Elevated by such sentiments, your minds will become calm and sedate. You will look down, as from a superior ftation, on the petty diflurbances of thp world. They are the felfifh, the sensual, $8 


and the vain, who are most fuibje& to the impotence of passion. They are linked so dlofely to the world; by so many sides they touch every objea, and every per; fbnr around them, that they are perpetually hurt, and perpetually hurting others.
But the spirit of true religion removes to a proper distance from the grating objets of worldly contention. It leaves us fufficiently connerted with the world, for ading our part in it with propriety; but difeogages us from it so far, as to weaken its power of disturbing out tranquillity. It inspires magnanimity; and magnanimity always breathes gentleness. It leads us to view the follies of men with pity, not with rancour; and to treat, with the mildness of a superior nature, what in little minds would call forth all the bitterness of passion.

Aided by such considerations, let us cultivate that gentle wisdom which is, in so many refpeas, important both to our duty and our happiness. Let us assume  if as the ornament of every age, and of 6 every station. Let it. temper the petu lance of youth, and soften the morose ness of old age. Let it mitigate authority in those who rule, and promote deference among those who obey. I conclude with repeating the caution, not to mistake for true gentleness, that flimzy imitation of it, called polished nianners, which often, among the men of the world, under a smooth appearance, conceals much afperity. Let yours be native gentleness of heart, flowing from the love of God, and the love of man. Unite this amiable spirit, with a proper zeal for all that is right, and just, and true. Let piety be 'conmbined in your charader with humanity.
Let determined integrity dwell in a mild and gentle breast. A characer thus fup ported will command more real refpeaCt than can be procured by the most mining cccompli(hments, when separated from # SERMON  On the Disorders of the Passions.

## ESTHER  13. Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the King gate.



On the DISORDERS of the PAssioNs.



Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as Ifee Mordecai the Jew fitting at the King gate.

THESE are the words of one, who; though high in station and power, 

confeffed himself to be miserable. They relate to a memorable occurrence in the Persian history, under the reign of Ahafuerus, who is supposed to be the Prince known among the Greek historians by the name of Artaxerxes. Ahasuerus had advanced to the chief dignity in his kingd<om Haman an Amalekite, who inherited all the ancient enmity of his race to  the Jewifi nation. He appears, from --- what is recorded of him, to have beert a very wicked minister. Railed to greatnefi without merit, he employed his power solely for the gratification of his paflios.
As the honours which he poffeffed were next to royal, his pride was every day fe?
with that servile homage which is peculiar to Asiatic courts; and all the servants of the King prostrated themselves before him. In the midst of this general adulation, one person only flooped not to Haman. This was Mordesai the Jews who, knowing this Amalekite to be an enemy to the people of, God, and, with virtuous indignation, despising that in.
folence of prosperity with which he, saw him lifted up, bowed wot, nor did him rt verence. On this appearance of diftee fpeat from Mordecal, Haman was fall -wrath: But he thought scorn ta lay hand on Mordecai alome. Personal revenge wma not fufficient to satisfy hiim, So violent and black were his paffiins, that he rts solved to exterminate the whole tation to ýwhich Mordecai belonged. Abusing, for ghis cruel purpose, the favour of his crelulous Sovereign, he obtained a decree to  sent forth, that, against a certain day, al the Jews throughout the Persian dominions should be put to the sword.
LMean while, confident of success, and blind to approaching ruin, he continued exulting in his prosperity. Invited by Ahasuerus to a royal banquet, which Esther the Queen had prepared, he went forth that day joyful, and with a glad heart.
But behold- how flight an incident was fufficient to poison his joy! As he went forth, he law Mordecai in the King gate and observed, that fill he refused to do him homage: He fJood not up, nof *was moved for him; although he well knew the formidable designs which Haman was preparing to execute. One private man, who despised his greatness, and difdained fubmiflion, while a whole kingdom trembled before him; one spirit, which the utmost stretch of his power tuld neither subdue nor humble, blatt ( Rh1. ec his. trrumphs. Hig whole 'foul ',aa  Sfliaken with a storm of passion. Wrath, 
pride, and desire of ,revenge, rose into fury. With difficulty he reftraifted himrself in public; but as soon, as he ';aMf to his own house, he was forced to difclose the agony of his mind. He gathered together his friends and family, with Zerifh his wife. He told them oftheglor of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the King had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the King. He faid,moreaver, Tea, Ether the .ueen did let no man come in with the King, unto the bznquet that fje had prepared, but myself; and to-morrow also am 1 inited unto her with the King. After all this preamble, what is the conclusion ?-
Yetr all this availeth'me notbing,'fo long as I fee Mordecai the ew, fitting at the King gate.

The sequel of Haman  history I shall not now pursue. It might afford matter ,for iuch inftru6ion, by the confpicu ou0 justice of God in his fall and punish- 
ment. IBut, contemplating only the fin- , '
gular situation in which the Text presents lim, and the violent agitation of his mind which it displays, the following refleaions naturally arise, which, toge, ther with fpme pradical improvements, ihall make the fubjea of this discourse.
I. How miserable is vice, when one guilty passion creates so much torment!  How unavailing is prosperity, when, in the height of it, a single disappointment can destroy the relish of all its pleasures ! IIII How weak is human nature, which, in the absence of real, is thus prone to form to itself imaginary woes !
  How miserable is vice, when one guilty passion is capable of creating so much torment! When we discourse to you of the internal misery of sinners; when we represent the pangs which they fuffer, from violent paflions, and a corrupted heart; we are sometimes fufpeaed of chufing a theme for declamation, and  of- hbeig&ening, thp piqure. which-

All this availeth me nothing, long as I fee oardscai the ew fitting at the King gate."
"Had this been a' soliloquy of Harnan*'"
"within himself, it would have been a fuffilient discovery of his misery. But when we confider it as a confedfion which he makes to others, it is a proof that his misery was become insupportable. Foi -#- -such agitations of the mind every man - firives to conceal, becaufd he knows they dilhonour him. Other griefs and forrows, he can, with freedom, pour out toj a confident. What he fuffers from tIh injuftice'or malice of the world, he is not ashamed to acknowledge. But when his fuffering ,rises from the bad difpofitionr of his owi heart; 'when, in the height of prosperity, he is rendered miserable, solely by edifappointed pride, every ordinary motive for communication ceases.
N6thing but the violence of anguish, can drive him to confess a ppffion which renders him odious,: and a weakness wh ch renders him despicable. To' what extremity, in particular, muff he be reduced; before he can disclose to his own family'the infamous secret of his misery In the eye of his family every man wies to appear refpedable, and to cover from their' knowledge whatever may villff or degrade' him. '-Attacked or 'reproached abtoad, he consoles himself with his im 
portance- at home; and in domeflic at-, 1.
tachment and rqfped, seeks for some penfation for the injustice of the world, Judge, then; of the degree of torment which Haman endured, by its breaking through all there restraints, and forcing him to publish his shame before those, from whom all men seek most to hide it.
How severe must have been the confli which he underwent within himself, before he called together his wife and all his friends for this purpose! How dreadful the agony he fuffered at the moment of his confeffion, when, to the astonished company, he laid open the cause of his distress !

Assemble all the evils which poverty, 
disease, or violence can inflit, and their flings will be found by far less pungent, than those which such guilty passions dart into the heart. Amidst the ordinary calamities of the world, the. mind can exert its powers, and fuggelt relief, And the mind, is properly the man; the fufferer, and his fufferings, can be diftinguflhed.

 Rn  But those disorders of passion, by feiz.,

' direaly on the mind, attack hu man nature in its strong hold, and cut off its last resource. They penetrate to the very feat of sensation; and convert all the powers of thought into instruments of Let us remark, in the event that is now before us, the awful hand of God; and admire his justice, in thus making the flunerk own wicAeddnefs to reprove bii, and bis hackflidings .correi him. Scepticks reason in vain against the reality of diO vine government. It is not a fibjet of dispute. It is a fadt which carries though evidence of sense, and displays itself before our eyes. We fee the Almighty manifeftly purfring thejinner with evil. We fee him conneaing with every single 
viation from duty, those wounds of the spirit which occafio the most exquisite torment. He hath not merely prriulgated his laws now, and deayed the dif, teibution of rewards- and puniThments ntil a future periq4 of beiag. But th6 lantiaons of his laws already take place; ER 
their effiets appear; and with such infi- .
.ite wisdom are they contrived, as to require no other ecutioners of justice against the fnner, than his own guilty passions. God needs not come forth from his secret place, in order to bring him to punishment. He needs not call thunder down from the heavens, nor raise any mitifier of wrath from the abyss below.
He needs only fay, Ephraim isjoined to his idols let him alone; And, at that instant, the finner becomes his own tormentor.
The infernal fire begins, of itself, to kindle within him. The worm that never dies, seizes on-his heart.

Let us remark also, from this example, 
how imperfetly we can judge from external appearances, concerning real happinefs or misery. All Persia, it is probable, envied Haman as the happiest Rerfon, in the empire; while yet, at themoment of which we now treat, there was not within its bounds, one more thoroughly wretched. We are seduced, 
 it  and deceived by that false glare whi I. 'profperity sometimes throws around bad men. We are tempted to imitate their crimes, in order to partake of their imagined felicity. But remember Haman, and beware 'of the snare. Think pot, when you behold a pageant of grandeir displayed to publick view, that you dit.
cern the ensign of certain happiness., 1i order to form any just conclusion, you muff follow the great man into the 
tired apartment, where he lays aside his disguise. You must tot only be able to penetrate into the interiour of families, but you must have a faculty by which you can look into the inside of'hearts, Were you endowed with such a powers ,you would most commonly behold good .men, in proportion to their goodness satisfied and easy; you would behold atrocious sinners, always reftlefs'and unhappy. *. 'I i VJnjuff are our complaints, of l4e promiscuous distribution made by Providence, of its favours ,among men. From, "
"'superficial views such complaints arise, ER  "
"The diflribution of the goods of fortune, indeed, may often be promiscuous; that js, ldifproportioned to the moral characters of men; but the allotment of real happiness fs never so. For to the wicked thbre is no peace. They are like the troubled jea when it cannot ref. They travel with pain all theiredays. Trouble and angui,/"
"prevail againfl them.' Terrours make theni afraid on every  A dreadful found ir in their ears; and they are 'in great fear -where no fear is.---Hitherto we have considered Haman under'the charaaer of a very wicked man, tormented by crimir nal paflions. Let us now confider him; Mierely as a child of'fortune, a'"
"ious man of the world; and proceed to -How unavailing worldly prosperity is, since, in the' midst of it, a single difa'isointmerit' is 'fuffcient' to embitter all its fTeafiftes.' We might Pat firft-imagInme tIat ihe natiural 'efft of prosperity would '. be, 
 be, to di uf over the mind a prevailihg __ fatisfadion, which the lesser evils of life could not ruffle or disturb. We might exped that as one in the full glow of health, dekpifes the inclemency of weather; so one in pofteffion of all the Advantages of' high power arid flation, should disregard light injuries; and, as perfe1c ease within himself, fhoul4 view, in the most favourable light, the behavi:
our of others around him. Such effects would indeed follow, if worldly prosperity contained in Itself the true principles of human felicity. Iut as it poffeffes them not, the very reverte of those confequences generally obtains. Prosperity debilitates, instead of' firengthening the mind. mos~ 6ommon effet is, to create an extreme sensibility to the slightest wound.
It foments impatient desires; and raises xpedations whfch no success can tatisfy.
It fofers a faTfe delicacy, which icilens in tthe midft'of indulgence. By repeated gratification, it ltunts the feelings of mien so what is pleating; arn4 leaves tAem unhappily unhappily acute to whatever is uneaty. ft 0, Hence, the gale -which another would scarcely feel, is, to the prosperous, a rude tempest, Hence, the rofe-leaf doubled below them on the couch, as is told of the effeminate Sybarite, breaks their reft.
Hence, the difrefpea fhowtt by Mordecar, preyed with fueh violence on the heart of Hanman. Upon rin principle of reason can we affiga a fufficient cause for all the difjrefs which this incident occasioned to 'him. The canfe lay not in the external incident. It lay within himself; it' afore from a mind diftempered by prosperity.

Let this example correft that blind eagerness, with which we ruth to the chace of worldly greatness and honours.
I fay not, that it should altogether divert ps from pursuing them; since, when enjoyed with temperance and wuldom, they may doubtless both enlarge Our utility, and contribhte to our comfort. But let it teach us, not to over-rate them. Let it convince us, that ublefs we add to them the npeefftry corrtaives of piety and' vir 1  tue, they are, by themselves, more likerly tcF render us wretched, than to make us Let the memorable fate of Hamar suggest to us also, how often, besides corrupting the mind, and engendering internal misery, they lead us among precipices, and betray us into ruin. At the moment when fortune seemed to finile upon him, with the most serene and fettled afpt .
she swas digging in secret the pit for hiS fall. Prosperity was weaving around his head the web of defirution. Success inflamed his pride; pride increased his thirst of revenge; the revenge which, for the fake of one man, he fought to execute on a whole nation, incensed the Queen; ah3 he is doomed to fuffer the fame death which he had prepared for Mordecai.,-
Had Haman remained in a private ila.  he niight have arrived at a peaceable old age. He might have been, I shall not, fay, a good or a happy man, yet pro3 bably far less guilty, and .less wretchy  than when placed at the head bs the greatest empire in the East. Who knoweth owhat is good for man in this life, all the Ldays of his vain life, which he fpendeth as a ]adqw?

An extensive contemplation of human affairs, will lead us to this conclusion, That among the different conditions and, ranks of men, the balance of happiness is preserved in a great meafore equal; and that the high and the low, the richl and the poor, approach, in point of reat enjoyment, much nearer to each other, than is commonly imagined. In the lot of man, mutual compensations, both of pleasure and of pain, universally take place. Providence never intended, that any slate here should be either completely happy, or entirely miserable.. If the feelings of pleasure are more numerous, and Smore lively, in the higher departments of life, such also are those of pain. If greatness flatters our vanity, it multiplies our dangers.. If opulence increases our gratifications, it increases, in the fame proportioa% our desires and demands. If  the poor are confined to -a more narrow .. circle, yet within that circle lii molt those natural fatisfaalions which, af all the refinements of art, are- found t4 be the most geouine and true.-- In 4 state, therefore, where there is neither 1o much to be coveted on the one hand, tot to be dreadecY on the other, as at frf appears, How submissive ought we to be to the di of4l of Providence! How terns perate in our desires and'purfuits! Hot much more attentive to preserve our vr tue, and to improve our minds, thaa 
gain the doubtful and equivocal advantages of worldly prosperity I-But now, layhig aside the consideration of Haman greAt trimes;. laying aside his high prb..
fperityi viewing him simply as a man, let us obferve, from his history, "
"Ilr. How weak human nature is, "
"which, in the absence of real, is thus prone to create to itself imaginary woes."
"Al this avalleth me nothing, so lbn as I fe Mordecai the fewjiftitn at the King gate."

Thus, whild we are incessantly complaining of theý vanity and the evils of human life, we make that vanity, and we increase those evils. Unskilled in 'the art of extrading happiness from the objets ardund us, our ingenuity solely appears in 'converting them into misery."
"Let it not  thought, tha troubles of this kind are incident only 'to the great and the mighty. Though they, perhaps; -from the imtemperance of their passions, are peculiarly exposed to them; yet the disease itself belongs to human nature; and fpreaas. through all ranks. In the humble, and seemingly quiet shade of private life, discontent broods over its imaginary sorrows; preys utpon the citizen, no less than upon the courtier; and often nourishes passions, equally malig."
"nant in the 'cottage and in the palace."
"Having once seized the mind, it spreads its own gloom over every surrounding objeit; it every where searches out ma "
".terials for itself; and in no dire~aon more ER RM."
"frequently employs its unhappy aaivi- 4. ty, than in creating divisions amongst plarkiqd, and in magnifying flight pro'vocations into mortal injuries. Those felf-created miseries, imaginary in the cause, but real in the fuffering, will be found to form a proportion of human evils, not inferiour, either in severity or number, to all-that we endure from the unavoidable calamities of life. In Atuations where puph comfort might be enjoyed, this man superiority, and that man neglet, our jealopfy of a friend, our hatred ps a rival, an imagined asfront, or a mistaken point of honour, allow us no reppfe. Hence, discords in families, animofities among friends, and wars among nations. Hence, Haman miserable in the midst of all that greatness could bestow. Hence, multitudes in the most obscure flations, for whom Providence seemed to have prepared a quiet life, no less eager in their petty broils, nor less tormented by their pas "
"--' prize for which they contended."
"FROM this train of observation, which the Text has suggested, can he avoid rlfleting upon the disorder in which human nature plainly appears at prifent to 'lie ? We have beheld, in Haman, the pi&ure of that misery which arises from evil passions; of that unhappiness, which is incident to the highest prosperity; of that discontent, which is common, to every state. Whether we confider him as a bad man, a prosperous man, or fimply as a man, in every light we behold reason too weak for passion. This is the source of the reigning evil; this is the root of the universal disease. 'The story of Haman only shows us, what human nature has too generally appeared to be in every age. Hence, when we read the history of nations, what do we read but the history of the follies and crimes of men ?, We may dignify .those recorded tranfations, by calling them the intrigues of ltjtefmen, and the exploits ps conquer- $ "
"ours; but they are, in truth, no other than the efforts of discontent to escape from its misery, and the firuggles of contending yaffions among unhappy men. The history of mankind has ever been a continued tragedy; the world, a great theatre exhibiting the fame repeated scene, of the follies of men Thooting forth into guilt, and of their passions fermenting, by a quick process, into misery."
"SBut can we believej that the nature of man came forth in this slate from the hands of its gracious Creator? Did he frame this world, and store it with inhabitants, solely that it might be replenilbed with crimes and misfortunes ?-In the moral, as well as in the natural world, we may plainly discern the signs of some violent convulsion, which has shattered the original workmanship ofi the Almighty."
"Amidst this wreck of human nature, traces still remain which indicate its Author. Those high powers of conscience and reason, that capacity for happiness, "
" that ardour of enterprize, that glow of  I_. affedion, which often break through the gloom of human vanity and guilt, -are like the scattered columns, the br6kent arches, and defaced sculptures of some fallen temple, whose ancient fpleridour appears amidst its ruins. So confpictidus in human nature are those charaters, both of a high origin, and of a degraded state, that, by many religious seas throughout the earth, they have been seen and confeffed. A tradition seems to have pervaded almost all nations, that the human race had either through some offence forfeited, or through, some- mifSfortune loft, that flation of primaval honour which they once poffeffed. But while, from this doarine, ill underftoodt and involved in many fabulous tales, the nations wandering in Pagan darkness could draw no consequences that were just; while, totally ignorant of the nature of the disease, they fought in vait for the remedy; the fame divine revelation, which' has informed us in what manner our apoftacy arose, from the abuse "
"of our rational powers, has inftruaed us alfp how we may be restored to virtue and t9 l4ppinefs."
"JIET us, therefore, fludy to improve thj assistance which this revelation affords, for the restoration of our nature, and the recovery of our felicity. With humble and grateful minds, let us apply to those pnedicinal springs which it hath. opened, for curing the disorders of our heart and paffionq. In this view, let us, with reverence, look up to that Divine Personage, who descended into this world, on purpose to be she light and the life of men:"
"who came, in the fulness of grace and truth, to repair the desolations of many generationt, to restore order among the works of God, and to raise up a new earth, and new heavens, wherein righteousness Jhould dw;ll for ever. Under his tuition let us put ourselves; and, amidst the Rtorms of passion to which we are here exposed, and the slippery paths which we Soufly to our own understanding. Than&"
"ful that a Heavenly Conduator vouchsafes his aid, let us earnestly pray, that from him may descend divine light to guite our fleps, and divine firength to fortify our minds. Let us pray, that his grace may keep us from all intemperate pasfions, and mistaken pursuits of pleasure; that whether it shall be his will to give or to deny us earthly prosperity, he may bless us with a calm, a found, and well-regulated mind; may give us moderation in success, and fortitude under disappointment; and may enable us so to take'warning from the crimes and miseries of othefs, as to escape the snares of guilt."
"WH I we thus maintain a due pendence on God, let us also exert ourselves with care in aaing our own part."
"From the whole of what has beer said, this important inftrution arises, That the happiness of every mati depends nore ptpon the state of his own mind, than upon any one external circumflance; nay, "
"more than upon all external things put together. We have seen, that inordinate paffons are the great diflurbers of life; and that, unless we posses& a good confcience, and a well-governed mind, difcontent will blast every enjoyment, and the'"
"highest prosperity will prove only difguifed misery. Fix then this conclusion in your minds, that the deftruaion of your virtue, is the deftrudion of your peace."
"Keep thy heart with all diligence; govern it with the greatest care; for out of it are the'"
"issues of hfe. In no flation, in no period, think yourselves secure from the dangers which spring from your passions. Every age, and every station, they beset; from youth to grey hairs, and from the peafant'"
"At your first setting out in life, efpe cially, when yet unacquainted with the world and its snares, when every pleasure enchants with its smile, and every'"

"'strong desire, If you allow any palioi everl though it be esteemed innocent, to acquire an absolute ascendant, yout inward peace will be impaired. But it any, which has the taint of gbilt, take, early poffeffion of your mind, you rilay date from that moment the ruin of yourt tranquilljty. Nor with the season of youth does the peril end. To the imha petuoJty of youthful desire, succeed the, more sober, but no less dangerous, attachments of advancing years; when the passions which are conne with interest and ambition begin their reigat and too frequently extend their malignant influence, even over those periods of life which ought to be most tranquit From the first to the last of man abdde on earth, the discipline must hever be relaxed, of guarding the heart from the dominion of paflion. Eager passions, and violent desires, were not made for man.1 They exceed his sphere, They find nid adequate objets on earth; and of courfe' A "
"can Be produftive of nothing but misery."
"The certain consequence of indulging thent is', that there fhal comean evil day, when the inguilh of diiappointment shall drive ut to acknowledge, that all which we enjoy avaleth us nothing."
"You are not to imagine, that the warn ings which I have given in this discourse, are applicable only to the cafe of such signal offenders as he was, of wh6m the Text treats. Think not, as I am afraid too many do, that, because your passions have not hurried you into atrocious deeds, they have therefore wrought no mirchief, and have left no fling behind them. By a continued series of loose, though apparently trivial, gratifications, the heart is often as thoroughly corrupted, as by the commission of any one of those enormous crimes which spring from great ambition, or great revenge. Habit gives the paflions strength, while the absence of glaring guilt seemingly juflifies them; and, una~aketed by remorse, thd finner proceeds in his course, till he waxmbold in guilt, and  become ripe for ruin. For, by gradual and latent steps, the deftruaipn of ouq virtue advances. Did the evil unyeil itself at the beginning; did the florm whlcl is to overthrow our peace, discover, as it rore, all' its horrours, precautions would more frequently be taken against it. But we are imperceptibly betrayed; and from one licentious attachment, one criminal passion, are, by a train of consequences, drawn on to another, till the government of our minds is irrecoverably loft. The enticing and the odious passions are, in this refpet, similar in their process; and, though by different roads, condu& at last to the fame issue. David, when he.firft beheld Bathsheba, did not plan the death of iUriah. Haman was not deliveied up all at once to the madness of revenge. His passions rose with the rifng tide of profperity; and pride completed what profperity began. What was originally no more than displeasure at Mordecai difrefpet, increased with every invitation he received to the banquet of the Queen; till it im- ER "
"pelled him to devise the slaughter of a VI1, whole nation, and ended in a degree of rage, which confounded his reason, and lurried him to ruin. In this manner, every criminal passion, in its progress, swells and blackens; and what was at first a small cloud, such as the Prophet servant saw, no bigger than a man hand, riing from thefea *, is soon found to carry the tempest in its womb."

of proper motives to ation; and that complete discovery would have raised him to a sphere too high for his pre sent powers. He is, therefore, permitted 
,to know only in part; and to fee through . I .a glass, darkly. He is left in that state .of conjecture, and .partial information, which, though it may occasionally fubjet him tq distress, yet, on the whole, conduces most to his improvement; which asfords him knowledge fufficient for the purposes of virtue, and of a&ive life, without diflurbing the operations of his mind, by a light too bright and dazzling. This evidently holds, with refpeft to that degree of obscurity which now covers the great laws of Nature, the decrees of the Supreme Being, the state of the invisible world, the future events of our own life, and the thoughts and designs which pass within the breasts of others *.

But there is an ignorance of another kind, with refpet to which the application of this remark may appear more dubious; the ignorance under which men labour concerning their happiness in the present life,, and the means of attaining it.
  * Vid. SE?.MJV.If there be foundation for Solomon '. complaint in he Text, who knoweth whdt is good for man in this life ? this confequence may be thought inevitably to fol-low, That the days of his life must be vain in every sense; not only because they are fleeting, but because they are empty too, -like the Jhadow. For, to what purpose are all his labours in the pursuit of an objea, which it is not in his power to discover or ascertain ?-Let us then fertoufly enquire, what account can be given of our present ignorance, refpeaing what is good for us in this life; whether no thing be left, but only to wander in uncertainty amidst this darkness, and to lament it as the fad consequence of our fallen state; or whether such inftructions may not be derived from it, as give ground for acknowledging, that by this, as by all its other appointments, the wiSf dom of Providence brings real good out of seeming evil. I shall, in order to determine this point, firit, endeavour to iti lustrate the doCtrine of the Text, That we know not, or at most know imperfealy, i "
"'vhat is good for us in this life: I Ihall next explain the causes to which this deset in our knowledge is owing: And Ahen shall ihow the purposes which it was intended to serve, and the effeas which it ought to produce on our conduct."
"THE whole history of mankind seems a comment on the docrine of the Text."
",When we review the course of human *affairs, one of the first objets whith every where attracts our notice, is, the mif-taken judgment of med concerning their own interest. That fore -evil, which o0lomon long ago remarked with refpe.-to riches, of their being kept by the owners thereof to their hurt, takes place equally with refped to dominion and power, and all the splendid objects and high flationd -of life. We every day behold men climbing, by painful steps, to that dangerous height, which, in' the end, renders their fall more vere, and their ruin' more cor "
"E ERM. fpicuous. .But it is not to high flations , . 'that the docQrine of the Text is limited."
"In the crimes by which too often these are gained, and in the misfortunes which they .afterwards bring forth, the greater part of every audience may think themselves little concerned. Leaving such themes, therefore, to the poet and the historian, let us come nearer to ourselves, and survey the ordinary walk of life."
"Around us, we every where behold a busy multitude. Restless and uneasy in their present situation, they are incessantly employed in accomplishing a change of it; and, as soon as their with is fulfilled, we discern, by their behaviour, that they are as diffatisfied as they were before. Where they expeaed to have found a paradise, they find a desert. -The man of business pines for leisure. The leisure for which he had longed, proves an irksome gloom; and, through want of employment, he languishes, fickens, and dies."
"The man of retirement fancies no state to be so happy, as that of aaive life. JBut he,has not engaged long in the tumults "
"pnd contests ps the world, until he finds *"
",cavfe to Jook,back with regret on the calm hours of his former privacy and retreat."
"Beauty, wit, eloqupnce, and fame, are eagerly desired by pegfons in every rank of life. They are the parent fondeg wish for his child; the ambition of the young, and the adrmiration of the old."
"And yet, in what numberless inflances ýhave they proved, to those who poffeffed Sthem, no other than ihining f9ares feduftions to vice, inftigations to folly, and, in the end, sources of misery ? Comfortably might their jays have passed, had they been lels cqnfpjcupus. But the diftinaions which brought them forth to ýptice, conferred splendour, and withdrew Lhappinefs. .Long life is, of all others, the most general, and seemingly thJe mnof innocent, objed of desire. With refpet to this too, we so frequently err, that it would have been a blessing to many to have had their wiih denied."
"There was a period, when they might have quitted the flage with honour, and Vilr. in peace. But by living too long, they outlived their reputation; outlived their family, their friends, and comforts; and reaped nothing from the continuance of days, except to feel the pressure of age, to taste the dregs of life, and to behold a wider compass of human misery."
"Man walketh in a vain Jhow. His fears are often as vain as his wishes. As what flattered him in expetation, frequently wounds him in poffeffioi; so the event to which he looked forward with an anxious and fearful eye, has often, when it arrived, laid its terrours aside; nay, has brought in its train unexpected blessings. Both good and evil are beheld at a distance, through a perfpedive which deceives. The colours of objeas -when nigh, are entirely different from what they appeared, when they were viewed in futurity."
"THE fact then being undoubtedly cer tain, that it is common for men to be deceived in their profpeds of happinef, Jet us next enquire'into the causes of that deception. Let us attend to those peculiar circumfiances in our state, which tender ?us such incompetent judges of future good tor evil in this life."
"First, We are not fufficiently acquaint with ourselves, to foresee our futdre feelings, We judge by the sensations of ,the present moment; and, in the fetvour of desire, pronounce confidently concerning the desired objet. But we refleat not, that our minds, like our bodies, tn,dergo great alteration from the situations into which they are thrown, and the progreffive flages of life through which they 'pafs. Hence, concerning any condition which is yet untried, we conjecure with much uncertainty.' In imagination, we carry our present wants, inclinations, and -"
"dentiments, into the fate of life to which we aspire. But no sooner 'have we entered on it, than our sentiments and inclinations change. New wants and desires arise; new objeds are required to gratify  them; and by consequence our old dif fatisfadion returns, and the void, which was to have been filled, remains as great as it was before."
"r But, next, supposing our knowledge of'"
"ourselves fufficient to direa us in the choice of happinefa, yet still we are liable to err, from our ignorance of the conieaions which subsist between our own condition and that of others. No individual can be happy, unless the circumflances of those around him be so adjufted as to conspire with his interest. For, in human society, no happiness or mifery flands unconneaed and independent."
"Our fortunes are interwoven by threads innumerable. We touch one another on all sides. One man misfortune or-fuccess, his wisdom or his folly, often, by its consequences, reaches through multitudes. Such a system is far too complicated for our arrangement. It requires adjustments beyond our skill and power."
"It is a chaos of events, into which our eye cannot pierce; and is ~capable of re "
"gulation, only by him who perceives at FRM."
"One glance the relation of each to all."
"Farther, As we are ignorant of the events which will arise from the combination of our circumstances with those of others, so we are equally ignorant of the influence which the present tranfa2tions of our life may have upon those which are future. The important question is not, What is good for a man one day; but what is good for him all the days of hit life? Not, what will yield him a few scattered pleasures; but what will render his life happy on the whole amount?"
"And is he able to answer that queffion, who knoweth not what one day may bring forth; who cannot tell, whether the events of it may not branch out into consequences, which will assume a diredion quite opposite to that in which they set forth, and spread themselves over all his life to come? There is not any present moment that is unconneced with some future one. The life of every man is a continued chain of incidents, each link SE  of which hangs upon the former. 'The yU transition from cause to effea, from event to event, is often carried on by secret fleps, which our foresight cannot divine, and our fag4city is unable to trace. Evil may, at some future period, bring forth good; and good may bring forth evil, both equally unexpeted. Had the Pa, triarch, Joseph, continued to loiter under his father fond indulgence, he might have lived an obscure and insignificant life. From the pit and the prison, arose the incidents which made him the ruler of Egypt, and the saviour of his father house."
"Lafily, Supposing every other incapa, "
"city to be removed, our ignorance of the dangers to which our spiritual state is exposed, would disqualify us for judging soundly concerning our true happiness, Higher interells, than those of the present world, are now depending. All that is done or fuffered by us here, ultimately refers to that immortal world, for which good men are trained up, under the cars of pn Almighty Parent. We are as "
"competent judges of the measures necef- ----"
"fary to be pursued for this end, as children are, of the proper condua to be held in fheir education. We foresee the dangers of our spiritual, flill less than we do those of our natural state; because we are lefj attentive to trace them. We are fiill more exposed to vice than to misery; because the -confidence which we place in our virtue, is yet worse founded than that which we place in our wisdom. Can you efteemn him prosperous, who is raised to a fitua."
"tion which flatters his passions, but which corrupts his principles, disorders his temper, and, finally, overfets his virtue ? In the ardour of pursuit, how little are these effeas foreseen ? And yet, how often are they accomplithed, by a change of condi."
"tion? Latent corruptions are called forth; feeds of guilt are quickened into life; a growth of crimes arises, which, had it not been for the fatal culture of prosperity, would never have seen the light. How often is man, boastful as he is of reason, "
"merely the creature of his fortune ; form."
", .  and moulded, by the incidents of his life!-Ha;ael, when yet a private maný detested the thoughts.of cruelty. Thou Jhalt flay the young men with bte sword, said the Prophet : Thou fjalt daJh the cbildren, and rip up the women with child. Is thyfervdnt a dog, replied Hazael, that he Jf7ould do these things ? But no sooner was he clothed with the coveted purple, than it seemed to taint his nature. He comnmnitted the crimes of which, at a diflance, he believed himself incapable ; and became the bloody tyrant, whose charaaer his foul once abhorred #."
"SuCH then at present is man; thus incapable of pronouncing with certainty concerning his own good or evil. Of futurity he difcerhs little; and even that little he fees through a cloud. Ignorant of the alteration which his fentimentq and desires will undergo from new fituations in life; ignorant of the confequeq 2 Kircgs  12, 13."
"ces which Will follow fromt the combina- "
"tion of his circumstances with those of pthers around him; ignorant of the influence which the present may have on the future events of his life; ignorant of the effec which a change of condition may produce, on his moral charater, and 'his eternal interests; How can he know what is good for him all the days of his vain life, which hefpendeth as ajhadow ?"
"Instead of onily lamenting this ignorance, "
"let us, in the last place, confider how it ought to be improved; what duties it suggests, and what wife ends it was intendfd by Providence to promote."
"I. LET this doctrine teach us to pro ceed with caution and circumfpe&ion, through a world where evil so frequently lurks under the form of good. To be humble and modest in opinion, to be vigilant and attentive in conduc, to diffruft fair appearances, and to restrain rash defires, are infiruCions which the darkness of our present slate should strongly in "
"E  culcate. God hath appointed our fitua4 Stiom *to be so ambiguous, in order both to call forth the exertion of those intelligent powers which he hath given us, and to enforce our dependence on his gracious, aid. It is not in man that walketh, to direc his fleps. Surrounded with so many bewildering paths, among which the wisest are ready to stray, how earnefily should we implore, and how thankfully should we receive, that divine illumination which is promised in scripture to the pious and the humble I Thefecret of the Lord is with them that fear him. He will guide then with his council. He will teach them the way that they jhould chufe. But what must be the fate of him, who, amidst all the dangers attending human conduct neither looks up to Heaven for diretion, nor properly exerts that, reason which God hath given him? If to the most diligent enquirer, it proves so difficult a talk to distinguish true good, from thfol fallacious appearances with ,which it is ever blended, how should be discover irt who' brinigs neither patience nor attention to the search; who applies to no other counsellor than present pleasure, and, with a rash and credulous mind, delivers himself up to every suggestion of desire )"
"This admonition I particularly diret to those, who are in a period of life too often charaCerized by forward prefumption, and headlong pursuit. The selfconceit of the young, is the great source of those dangers to which they are exposed; and it is peculiarly unfortunate, that the age which flands most in need of the counsel of the wife, should be the most prone to contemn it. Confident in the opinions which they adopt, and in the mefures which they pursue, they seem as if they underflood Solomon to fay, not, VWho knoweth, but, Who is ignorant of what is good for man all the days of his life? The bliss to be aimed at, is, in their opinion, fully apparent. It is not the danger of mistake, but the failure of success, which they dread. Aativity to seize, not sagacity to discern, is the SER i 'only requisite which they value.- How VIL . long shall it be, ere the fate of your pre deceffors in the fame course, teach you wisdom ? How long shall the experience of all ages, continue to lift its voice to you hii vain? Beholding the ocean on which You are embarked, covered with wrecks, are not those fatal signals fufficient to admonish you of the hidden rock? If, in Paradise itself, there was a tree which bare fruit fair to the eye, but mortal in its effeds, how much more, in this fallen slate, may such deceiving appearances be expeded to abound ! The whole state of Nature is now become a scene of delusion to the sensual mind, Hardly any thing is what it appears to be: And what flatters most, is always farthest from reality. There are voices which sing around you; but whose firains allure to ruin. There is a banquet spread, where poison is in every dish. There is a couch which invites you to repose; but to slumber upon it, is death. In such situation, be not high-minded, but fear. Let sobriety temper your unwary ardour. Let R1M."
"modefly check your rash presumption.  ."
"Let wisdom be the offspring of refleaion now, rather than the fruit of bitter experience hereafter."
"JL LET our ignorance of what is good or evil, corre6t anxiety about worldly fuccess. As rashness is the vice of youth, -the opposite extreme of immoderate care is the vice of advancing years. The doctrine which I have illustrated, is equally adapted for checking both. Since we are so often betrayed into evil, by the miftaken pursuit of good, care and attention are requisite, both in forming our choice, and in conduaing our pursuit; but since our attention and care are liable to be so ofterl frustrated, they should never be alJowed to deprive us of tranquillity."
"The ignorance in which we are left con .cerning good and evil, is not such as to supersede prudence in' conduQ: For wisdom is fill found to excel folly, as far at 4ight excelletb darkness. But it is that gree of uncertainty, which ought to red ,vt1. der us temperate in pursuit; which ought to calm the perturbation of hope and fear, and to cure the pain of anxiety."
"Anxiety is the poison of human life. It is the parent of many fins, and of more miseries. In a world where every thing is so doubtful; where you may succeed in your with, and be miserable; where you may be disappointed, and be blest in the disappointment; what means this refllefs flir and commotion of mind ?

To the vanity of life, you add a vexation of spirit, which is wholly of your own creation, not of Divine appointment. For the dubious goods of this world were never designed by God to raise such eager attachment. They were given to man for his occasional refreihment, not for his chief felicity. By setting an excessive value upon objets which were intended only for your secondary regard, you change their nature. Seeking more fatisfaaion from them than they are able to afford, you receive less than they might give."
"* From a mistaken care to secure your hapSpinefs, you bring upon yourselves certain misery."
"III. LET our ignorance of good and evil, determine us to follow Providence, and to resign ourselves to God. One of  the most important Jeffons which can be  Sgiven to man, is resignation to his Maker; and nothing inculcates it more, than the experience of his own inability to guide himfelf.-You know not what is good for you, in the future periods of life.

He is not only liable to that disappointment of success, which so often frustrates all the defigns'ot men; but liable to a disappointment still more cruel, that of being fuccefsful and miserable at once. Riches-and pleasures are the chief temptations to criminal deeds. Yet those riches, when obtained, may very possibly overwhelm him with unforeseen miseries. Those pleasures may cut short his health and life. And is it for such doubtful- and fallacious rewards, "

"What will turn to his advantage in the course of this life, he cannot with any asfurance know. But this he may know, with full certainty, that by breaking theDivine commandments, he will draw upon his head that displeasure of the Almighty, which shall crush him for ever."
"The advantages of this world, even when innocently gained, are uncertain blefsings; when obtained by criminal means, they carry a curse in their bosom. To the virtuous, they are often no more than chaff. To the guilty, they are always poison."
"V. LET our imperfect knowledge of what is good or evil, attach us the more to those few things, concerning which  there Cah be no doubt of their being ^ truly good.

  LET our ignorance of what is good or evil here below, lead our thoughts and desires to a better world, I have endeavoured to vindicate the wisdom of jProvidence, by showing the many useful purposes which this ignorance at present promotes. It serves to check presumption and rashness, and 0to enforce a.ýdiligent exertion of our rational powers, 'joined with .a humble dependence on Divine aid."

It tends to attach us more closely to those things which are unqueflionably good. It is therefore such a degree of ignorance as suits the present cireumftances of man better than more complete information

## PSAL.  4. Commune with your own heart, upon your bed, and be still.


 ^  Rx ON, IX.










Commune with your own heart, upon your bed, and be Jfill.


~I UGCH communing with themselves Sthere has always been among man, 
kind; though frequently, God knows, to no purpose, or to a purpose worse than none. Could we discover the employments of men, in retirement, how often should we find their thoughts occupied ,
with fubjeas, which they would be ashamed to own? What a large share have ambition and avarice, at some times the grossest passions, and at other times the )1eaneft trifles, in their solitary musings?


They carry the world, with all its vices, 
into their retreat; and may be said to dwell I in the midst of the world, even when they seem to be alone.

This, surely, is not that fort of com muning which the Psalmist recominends.
For this is not properly commu'ning with our heart, but rather holding secret in"
"tercourfe with the world. What the Psalmist means to recommend, is 'religia bus kecolledion; that exercise of thought which is connected with the precept givri in the. preceding words, - to fland in dwe, and fin not. It'is to commune with ourselves, tinder the charaaer' of spiritual and immortal beings; and to ponder those paths of our feet) which are leading us to eternity..

"To conne& one plan of gaiety with' anot- Vt ther, is their- sole study; till, in a very short time, nothing' remain but to tread the fame beaten round; to enjoy what they have already enjoyed, and to fee what they have often seen.

Hence, these are the pert6ns, who after having run through a rapid course of pleasure, after having glittered for a few years in the foremost line of public amusements, are the most apt to fly at last to a melancholy retreat; not led by religion or reason, but driven by disappointed hopes, and exhaufled spirits, to the pensive conclusion, that all is vanity."

The great and the worthy, the pious and the virtuous, ihave ever been addiaqd to feeious retirement. It is the cha-,
raCeriftic of little and frivolous minds, to be wholly occupied with the vulgar objets of life. There fill up their defires, and supply all the entertainment, which their coarse apprehensions can relilh. But a more refined and enlarged mind leaves the world behind it, feels a call for higher pleasures, and seeks them in retreat. The man of public spirit has recourse to it, in order to form plans for general good; the man of genius, in qrder to dwell on his favourite themes; the philosopher, to pursue his discoveries; .hel faint, to improve hiimfief in.- grace.

The advantages of religious retirement il still more clearly appear, by confider  as was proposed, in the nest plaee, 
Sfome of those great objea& which iholdd there employ our thoughts. I ihall Mention Vt.
only three, which are of the most plain and IX.
acknowledged importance; God, the world, and. our owa chara&er.

I, WHi sN you retire from the world, omrmure twith your hearts concerning Gol.
Impressions of Deity, besides their being the principle of what is ftrialy termed religion, are the great support of all moral fenjiment, and virtuous condua, among inei.. But with what difficulty are they preserved in any due degree of force, amidst the affairs and avocations of -the world? While the crowd of surrounding objects is ever rulhing on the imagination, and occupying the senses and the heart, what is not only absent from view, but, by its nature, invisible, is apt to vanish like a shadow. Hence it is given as the charaaer of wicked men, in scripture, that they are. without God in the tworld. They deny not, perhaps, that he does exist; but it is the fame to them as though be did not: For having loft him &  from their view, his existence has no efc set on their condut. If,. at aniy titie, 
the idea,of God rife,in, theirnmind, it rises like a terrifying phantom which they hasten to expel; and which they gladly fancy to be unreal, because they fee it make so little impression on others arotmn4 them. , i Let him who retires to serious medita.
  begin with impressing deeply on hi4 mind this important truth, That therejs undoubtedly a Supreme Governour, who presides over the universe. But' letg im not imagine, that to commune witlthit heart concerning God, is to search iota the mysteries of the Divine Nature, or tq attempt a discovery of the whole plan of Providence. Long enough he may bel wilder himself in this maze, without making any proficiency in the pradical knowledge of God. Shall he who knows so little bs his own nature, or of the -an turepf the objeds with which he isfurjn rounded, expea to comprehend the Being whQ made him ? To commune wth OUr 
selves; to any aufeful purpose, on this fubl je is to bring home to our fouls the inl ternal, authoritative sense of God, as of a Sovereign and a Father. It is not to fpecu2 late about what is mysterious in his effendel but to contemplate what is displayed of hib perfe&ions. It is to realize the prefenc8 of the Supreme Being, so as to produce the most profound veneration; and to awaken thd earnest desire of as near an approacli as our natbre will permit, to that great Fountain of happiness and life.

"termof parts of the sea,. even there you would find him. For in him you live and move. He fills and animates all space. In the barren wilderness, as in the peopled region, you can trace his footsteps; and in the deepest solitude, you may hear a voice which testifies of him."
"Him, indeed, you are never to con found with the workmanship of his hands. Nature, in its most awful or noft *pleasing scenes, exhibits no more than different forms of inanimate matter. But on there dead forms is impreffid. the glory of i living Spirit. The beauty, or the ."
"greatness, which appears in them, flows from the Fountain of all greatness and behity; in him. it centers; ofi his perfection it reflects an image; and towards him thould lead your view.-In converfjng with a fellow-creature on earth, it is not with his body we converse, 'though it .is his body only which we fee. From his words and actions we conceive his mind; with. his mind,,though invisible, we hold -correspondence, and dire& towards this Spiritual Essence, our affection and regard."
"Jn like manner, though here we behold no more of God than what his works difplay, yet, in those displays, we are cApable of perceiving the Universal Spirit, and of '"
"holding correspondence with this unseen Being, in veneration, gratitude, and love."
"It is thus that a pious man, in his re tired meditations, viewing natural objets with a spiritual eye, communes with his heart concerning God. He walks among the various scenes of Nature, as within SE  the precin of a' great- temple, in' the Shabitual exercise of devotion.. To tiof discoveries of the Supreme Being In his works, let him apply the comment of his word. From the world of Nature, let him follow God into the world of Grace."

"We'trade, as within an inchanted circle, where nothing appears as it truly is. It is only in retreat, that the charm can be broken. Did men employ that retreat, not in carrying on the delusion which the world has begtn, not in forming plans of imaginary bliss, but in fubjeding the happiness which the world affords to a Ari discussion, the spell would dissolve; and in the-room of the unreal profpeas, which had long amused them, the nakednefr 6f the world would appear."
")Prepare yourselves, then, to encounter thi light of truth. Resolve rather to beat & the dilappointment of frome #atteria Ix ... hopes, than to wander ,for ever in. the paradise of fools.

Let the last conclusions which you lhall form, "
"8  enter into the present estimate which you   . make of the world, and of life."
"Moreover, in communing with your felyes concerning the world, contemplate it as fubjea to the Divine dominion. The greater part of men behold nothing more than the rotation of human affairs. They fee a great crowd ever in motion; the fortunes of men alternately rising and falling; virtue often distressed, and profperity appearing to be the purchase of worldly wisdom. But this is only the outside of things. Behind the curtain, there is a far greater 'fcene, which is beheld by none but the retired, religious fpefator. Lift up that curtain, when you are alone with God. ' View the world with the eye of a Christian and you shall fee, that while man heart dev his -way, it is the Lord who direEeth his fleps. You shall fee, that however meh appear to move and at after their own pleasure, they are, nevertheless, retained in secret bonds by the Almighty, and all their operations rendered subservient to the ends of his moral government. You ihall behold him obliging the wrath of '-"
"man to praise him; punishing the finner by means of his own iniquities; from the' trials of the righteous, bringing forth their reward; and to a state of eemifig universal confusion, preparing the wisest and most equitable issue. While the faJhion of this world -is paf fast away, you shall difcetn the glory of another rising to Tucceed it. ( You thall behold all human events, our griefs and our joys; our love and our hatred, our chara6ter and memory, absorbed in the ocean of eternity; and no trace of'our present exiftence left, except its being for ever well with the righteous, and ill with the wicked."

It is only in retreat, where those false femblances disappear, and those flattering voices are silent, that a man can learn to think soberly of him  and as he ought to think."
"It has been said, that there are three charaders which every man sustains; and these often extremely different front one anotherc One, which be poffefles in his own opinion; another, which he carties in the estimation of the world; and a third, which he bears in the judgment of God.

"Enqtlre, for this purpose, .whether you be not conscious, that the fair opinion which the world entertains of you, is founded on their partial knowledge, both of your abilities and your virtues ? Would you be willing that all your ations should be publickly canvassed?

Awe is the first sentiment that rises in the foul, at the view of his greatness.

But, considered in conjun&ion with the moral perfelions of the Divine Nature, it serves to heighten devotion. Goodness asse the heart with double energy, when residing in One so exalted. The goodness which we adore in him, is not like that which is commorn among men, a weak, mutable, undifcerning fondness, ill qualified to be the ground of assured trust. It is the goodness of a perfec Governour, aaing upon a regular extensive plan; a fleady principle of benevolence, conduaed by wisdom; which, fubjed to no variableness or *hadow of turning, free from all partiality and caprice, incapable of being either toothed by flattery, or ruffled by resentment, resembles, in its calm and equal lure, the eternal serenity of the highest heavens.

"SUCH in general are the dispositions that conflitute devotion. It is the union of veneration, gratitude, desire, and refignation. It expresses, not so much the performance of any particular duty, as the spirit which must animate all religious duties. It stands opposed, not merely downright vice; but to a heart whiph is cold, and insensible to sacred Ahiogs; which, from compulsion pqrhaps, no 5 4 2 and i  and'a sense of interest, preserves fomne rel XY gard to. the divine commands, but obeys them without ardour, love, 6r .
  To recommend this devout fpitr to your imitation. I begin with hbrejving, That it is of the utmroft confequerce'
to guard against extremes of every kinO in religion. We must beware, left, bI feekin to avoid one rock, we fplit~upon another, It has been long the fubje4 of remark, that superstition and enthufiafn are two capital sources of delusion; fuperflition, on the one hand, attaching men, with immoderate zeal, to the ritual and external part of religion; and enthufiafm, on the other; directing their whole attention to internal emotions, and myftical communications with' the spiritual world; while -neither the one, nor the other, has paid fufficient regaid to the great ioral duties of the. Christian life.
Biut, running' with intemperate eagerntefi from there two great abuses of religion, 

-ren foave negle&l6d to obrerve, tat there .

re extremes oppoi~te to each of them,., -
into which they are in hazard of precipitating themselves. Thus the horrour ot fuperflition has sometimes reached so far, as 1o produce contempt for all external Inlitutions; as if it were possible for religlon to subsist in the world, without forms of worship, or public acknow'edgmdnt of God. It has also happened, that some whcf in the main are well aseded 1i the aufe of goodness, obrervng tdi perfSns of a devout turn have at times teen'carrfed, by warm affetions, into unjustifiable excesses, have thence hallily concluded, that all devotion was ain tQoenthfiafthT; ana, separating relf'ion totals, from tie art and affeatons, lave reduced it to a frigid observance of 'what they call the rules of virtue. Thfs is the extreme which I purpose at present to combat, by showing you, first, That true devotion is rational, and well founded nbxt, That is of the highest importance tb every other part of religion  and virtue; and, lastly, That it is moa conducive to our happiness."
"IN the first place, True devotion Is ra:"
"tional, and well founded. It takes its ri from affetions, which are effentiaf to the human frame. We are formed by Nature, to admire what is great, and to love what is amiable. Even inanimate objeas have power to excite those emotions."
"The magnificent profpeds of the natural world, fill the mind with reverential awe."
"Its beautiful scenes create delight. When we survey the a&ions and behaviour of our fellow-creatures, the affections glow with greater ardour; and, if to be unmoved, in the former cafe, argues a aefe&"
"of sensibility in our powers, it discovers, in the latter, an odious hardness and depravity in the heart. The tenderness of an affedionate parent, the generosity of a forgiving enemy, the public spirit of a patriot or a hero, often fill the eyes with tears, and swell the breast with emotions too big for utterance.

The solid and material duties of a good life, they hold to be in a great measure independent,of devout affeaion; and think them fufi; ciently supported, by their necessary conpe&joa with out interest, both inr this an4 in a future world. They insist much upcn religion being a calm, a sober,- and r4tional principle .of condu&.--I admit -SE RM. that It is very lauda bl to ave a rltonal - .religion. Bus I muff admonish you, "
"it is both reproachful and criminal, to -have an insensible heart. - If we reduce reJigion into so cool 'a'fiate, as not to adtit love, affeCtion, and desire, 'we shall leave it in poffeffion of finall influence over human life.

'To dire6 their inci'iation and taste 'towards the highest oAje6ts; to florri a relish within them, for virtuous and .piritual enjoyment; to introduce religion Into the heart, is the provinzce of devotion ; and hence arises its importance to the interests of goodnefs.' SAgreeably to this doarine, the great Author of our religion, who welj knew what was in man, 'laid the foundation his whole fytfem in the regeneration o1 the heart. The change which 'was'to be accomplished on his followers, he did not purpote to effea, merely by regulating their external condu&; hut by forming within them . new fiature; by taking away the heart of lone, and giving then a heart of fieh, that is,'a heart relenting and tender, yielding to the Divine impulse, and readily susceptible of devout Impreffibns. Thou Jhalt love the Lord thy God, with al( thy heart, and mind, and foul, atd strength: This is the firfl and great commandment. Myfon, give me thy heart, is the call of God to each of us: And, indeed, if the heart be with-held, it is not easy to conceive what other offering we can present, that will be acceptable to hinm.

SOs what nature must that man religion be, who profeffes to worship God, and to believe in Christ; and yet raises his thoughts towards God, and his Saviour, without any warmth of gratitude or love? I speak not of those occasional desays of pious affecion, to which the best are fubje&, but of a total insensibility to MU this part of religion. Surely, let the ont.

, 'ward behaviour be ever  irreptoachablej there must be some effential-defe il i *
heart, which remains always unmoved at the view of infinite goodness. -The afu fetions cannot, in this cafe, be deemed to flow in their natural channel. Somd concealed malignity must have tainted the inward frame. This is not the riaar whom you would chufe for your bofoma friend; or whose heart you could expee to answer, with reciprocal warmth, to yours. His virtue, if it deserves, that name, is not of the moit amiable fortl and may, with reason, receive the appefI lation (often injudiciously bestowed) of cold and dry morality. Such a perfot must, as yet, be far from the kingdonr of Heavesi.I As devotion is thus essential to religlio ia.its principle, so it enters into the pmr per discharge of all its duties.

rfe&iomn cannot, therefore, but ennoble 4nd4 improve it. The pure love of God, paturally conneas itself with the love of man. Hence. devotion has been oftea found a powerful infirument, in huma, niting the manners of men, and tanming their sunruly pallions. It fmoothe what i rough, and softens what is fierce, in owr eature. It is the great purifier of the 4Iffeions. It inspires contempt of the low gratifications belonging to animal life It promotes a. humble and cheerful contentment with our lot; and subdues that eager desire of riches and of power, which has filled this unhappy world with orimes and misery. Finally, it beftows that enlargement of heart in the fervicd of God, which is the great principle, both of perseverance, and of progress in lirtue, He who, unacquainted with devout affections, ets himself to keep thd Diviue commandments, will advance in obedience with a low and languid pacf likU one who, carrying a. heavy burdtn, toils to m0unt the hill.. But he whore ^ heart devption has wartned,, will procee4 on his3way, 'cheerful and rejoicipg. The 'one performs his duty, only because it is commanded ; tbenother, because he loves it. The one is inclined to do no more than necessity requires; the'other seeks to excell. The- one looks for his reward in somewhat besides religioh; the other, finds it  religion itfelfi. It is hbs. meat and drink to do the will of, that heavenly Father, whom he loves and adores. Which of these two are likely to make the greateft improvemeqt in goodness, is easily difcerned. Let us now confider, 
SIN the third place, the influence of devotion on the happiness of life. Whatever promotes and strengthens virtue, whatever calms and regulates the temper, is a source of happiness. Devotion, as I have just pow flh9wn, produces those effeas in a remarkable: degree. It inspires compos sure of spirit, 'mildnefs, and benignity1 weakens the painful, and cherilhes thq tarries on the life of a pious man in a smooth and placid tenour.

Besides exerting this habitual influenc on the mind, devotion opens a field, of enjoyments, to which the viciotfs are entire strangers; knjoymeits tl4d more valua6fe, as .they' peculiarly belong io retirement wheh the world leaves us, and to adversity when it becomes our foe. The are the two feaforis, for which every wife man would moss wifl' to provide some lidden ftoie of comfort. Fdr let fiim be plac in the most favourable fituatiofi which the human slate admits, the world can neither always amtfe hint, hor always shield him ftomn distress. There will be many. houtrs of vacuify, and many of deje&ion, in hig life. IF he be a stranger to God, and) to devoti6n, hoi7 dreary will the' gloom of solitude ofteh prove?

"III. I ENDEAVOUR tO corre& some errors, into which men are apt to falk concerning devotion, For it is but too obvious, that errors are often committed in this part of religion. These frequently disfigure its appearance before the world, and subjeCt it to unjust reproach. Let us therefdre attend deliberately to its nature, "
"o as to diftinguilf pure 6and rational  "
"votion, of which- I have hitherto treated, ffom that which is, in any degree;, puril ous and adulterated.

In the fifii place, It is an error 'to place 8evotion in thd mere perfot-mance of any external ah of worship. Prayer and praife,' together itih the ordinancel peculiar to the Christian religion, are the agpoVited means of raifi'ng the heart towards the Supreme Being. They are th6 inhituted signs of devotin ; the language .in which it naturally expresses itself. But let us remember, that they' are signs and expreflons only; and we' all know, that, in various cares, thete may not correspond to the thing signified. It is  the difpofition of the heart, not in the motion of the lips, or in the posture of the bodr, that devotion copfifts. The heart .may pray or praise, when no words are uttere. But if the heart be unconcerned or ill affeated, 'all the words we can utter, how properly framed soever, are n6 other than empty and unacceptable founds in the ear of the Almighty.

the feond plaee, It is an err'or to -ai eonceive the pleaforts and advantaged of '.devotion, to be indiscriminately *open t9 -all. Dev6tion, like mapy parts of eligiop, may in some lights- boe confidred 'a privilege, ap4 in others 4s a duty, It is the duty of all, tQ love God, and to trefigq thermielyve tq his wilt, Biut; i the privilege of good WeA oply, It -rejoice in God, and to confide in 4is friendship. Hence a certain prepation is requisite, for the enjoyment 9f devotipa in its whole extent. Not qnly must ti life be reformed from, grol enprziitifs, but the heart must have undergop$ that change which the qofpel dqmands. A competent knowledge of God npuif b1 acquired. A proper fgundatiop must bI laid in faith and repentance, for Wtefourfe with Heaven.

They who would rush all at once from, the arms of the wqrld, inIto the sacre4 retreat of devotion; they who imagine that retreat to stand alwayq ready fr jh .reception of such as betake themfeh, lvto  fox no alpn,,bgbggcadu every qther .ir%, .

"apdn ;to consecrate their days entirely tot God, Situatitin sometimes occur, which both justify a great degree of retreat'from the world, and entitle it to refpea. But, wijh regard to ,the bulk of mankind, Chfiftian devotion neither requires nor imtolies anry such sequestration from the affairsa of men:- Nay, for the most partj it 'will be cultivated with greater ficcefs by those who mingle it with the acive employments of life. For the mind, wJhan entirely oicupied by any one objet4,i is in' hazard of viewing it at last through a false medium., Obje6s, efpeciily, so great and sublime as those of devdtion, when we attempt to fix upon SER1M. them unremitting 'attetion, *overketeh - and disorder oua feeble powers , The mind,, by being relaxed,- returns to them with more advantage, As none of our organs can bear intense sensations withbut injury; as the eye, when edzzled -with overpowering light, -beholds imaginary colours, and loses the real diftindkiot ofljobje ; so the mind, when Qverheated by perpetual contemplation of celcftial tdinag, has been sometimes found to.anjiftae dta Arong impressions of fancy, fgtfupernat,.

"Ements -of humana society. Itjchetksi io deed, that spirit of ,diffipatioq which too prevalent. It not only prohibits plea- "
"(uses which -are unlawful, but likewise -"
"that unlawful degree of attachment to pleasures in themselves innocent, which withdraws the attention of man from what is serious and important. But it brings amusement under due limitation, without ektirpating it. It forbids it as ,the bufinefa, but permits it as the re3axation, of life. For there is nothing ih, the spirit of true religion, which is hostile to a cheerful enjoyment of our- situation in the world, 1 They who look with a severe and iddignant eye, upon all the recreations by which the cares of men are relieved, and the union of society is cemented, are,in two refpes, injurious to religion. First, they exhibit it to others under a fotbidding form, by clothing it with the garb of so mitch unnecessary austerity. And next, they deprive the world of the betiefit which their exarpple might afford, iS drawing the line between innocent and'
dangerous pleasures. By a temperate participation of those which are innocent' , i-- they might fuccefsfully' exert that authority, which a virtuous and' refpetable chara&er always poffeffes, mn\efitrainng undue excess. They would' show the young and unwary, at what point they ought.
to flop. They would have it in their power, to regulate, in' some degree, public 'manners ; to check extravagance, to humble presumption, ~ put vice 
the blush. But, through injudicious teverity, they fall short of the good they might perform. By 'an indiscriminate censure of all anmufement, they detra from the weight of their reproof, when amusement becomes undoubtedly einfuT.
By totally withdrawing them'elves from the'circle of cheerful life, they deliver up the entertainments of society, into the hands of the loose, and the corrupted; and permit the bliad power of fashion, uncontrouled, to establish its own standards, and to exercife' its dangerous sway pver the world.

IN the fifth place, It is ah error to  


lieve, tha; devotion nourishes, a spirit of severity, in. judging of the manners and charaters bs6 others. Under this reproach, indeed, it has so long fuffered in the world; that. with too many, the appellation of devout, suggests no other tharafter, but that of a four and recluse bigot, who delights in censure. But the reproach is unjufi; for fueh a spirit is entirely opposite to the nature of true del votion. The very first traces which it imtprints on the mind, are candour and humility. Its principles atre libeal. Its'
genius is unaffuming' and mild. Severe only to itself, it makes every allowance for others which humanity can suggest tJ claims no privilege of looking into their hearts, or of deciding with refped to their eternal ftate.--I your supposed devotion produce contrary effedts; if it infuse harshness into your sentiments, and acrimony into your speech ; you may conclude, that under a serious appear-."

It were too much to expe that in the prefett state of human frailtyo those happy feelings should be uniform incd conflant. Opprefflon of worldly cares, languor of spirits, and infirmities of health, frequently indispose us for the enjoyment of devout affekions.- Pious men, on these occafrons, are in hazard of passing judgment on their own state with too much severity , as if, for some great iniquity, they were condemned by God to final hardness of heart. Hence arises that melancholy, which has been seen to overcloud them; and which has given occasion, to many contemptuous fcoffs of ungodly men. But it is a melancholy which deserves to be treated with eendern efs, not with contempt. It is-the excess of virtuous and pious sensibility. It is bt the  the overflowing of a heart affetedC int extreme degree, -with the humble feni of-its own failings, and withb ardent concern to attain the favour of God.-' A weakness, however, we' admitp it, tb bd though not a crime ; and hold it to be perfetly separable from the essence of devotion. For contrition, though it rhay melt, ought not to fink or overpowet thd heart of a Chritlian. The tear of repent-&
ance bririgs its own relief. Religion it a spring of consolation, not of terrour, to every well-informed mind, which, in 'a proper manner, rests its hope on the infinite goodness of God, and the all-fufficient merit of Christ.

To conclude, Let us remove from de5 .votion, all those mistakes, to which thd corruptions of men, -or their ignorance and prejudices, have given rife. With us let it be the worship of God, in spirit and in truth ; the elevation of the foul towards him, in simplicity and love. Let us pursue it as the principle of virtuous tondua, and of inward peace. By fre- I 
quent and serious meditation on the great objeas of religion, let us lay ourselves open to its influence. By means of the inflittitions of the Gospel, let us cherifi its impreflions. And, above all, let us pray to God, that he may eflablifh its power in our heart. For here, if any where, his assistance is requisite. The spirit of devotion is his gift. From his inspiration it proceeds. Towards him it tends; and in his presence hereafter, it thall attain its full perfetion.


# SERMON XI. On the Duties of the Young.

## TITUS  6. Young men likewife exhort, to be sober-minded.



On the DUTIES of the You roung men likewise exhort, to befober-minded.

OBRIETY of mind, is one of tiofr  virtues which the present condition of human life strongly inculcates. The uncertainty of its enjoyments, checks presumption ; the multiplicity of its dangers, demands perpetual caution. Moderation, vigilance, and felf-government, are duties incumbent on all; but efpecially on such as are beginning the journey of life. To them, therefore, the admonition in the Text is, with great propriety, direted; though there is reason to fear, that, by them it is in hazard of being least regarded. Experience enforces the  
admonition on the molt giddy, after they .
have advanced in years. But the whole slate of youthful views and passions, is adverse to sobriety of mind. The scenes which present themselves, at our entering upon the world, are commonly flattering.
Whatever they be in themselves, the lively spirits of the young gild every opening profpea. The field of hope appears to stretch wide before them. Pleasure seems to put forth its blossoms on every 
Impelled by desire, forward they ruif with inconfiderlte ardour : Prompt to decide, and to choose; averse to hesitate, or to enquire; credulous, because untaught by experience; rash, because unacquainted with danger; head-firongi because unfubdued by disappointment, Hence arise the perils, of which it is my design at present to warn them. I shall take sobriety of mind, in its most compre*
henfive sense, as including the whole of that discipline which religion and virtue prescribe to youth. Though the words ER  of the Text are direaly addressed to young % men, yet, as the fame admonition is givet in a preceding verse to theother sex, the infirudions which arise from, the .Text -ai to be considered as common to both, I intend, first, to show them the importance of beginning early to give serious atteqtiop to their condua; and, next, to poin out those virtues which they ought chiefly to cultivate.

/ As soon as you are capable of rfflection, you must perceive that there is right and a wrong, in human aations You fee, that those who are born with the fame advantages of fortune, are not all equally prosperous in the course of life.
While some of them, by wife and steady condua, attain diftinaion in the world, and pass their days with comfort and iotour; others of the fame rank, by mean and vicious behaviour, forfeit the advantages of their birth, involve 'themfelves in much misery, and end in being a dif.
grace to their friends, and a burden on facietyr krarly, then, you may learn, that it is knot -6n the. external condition in -
Awhich you find yourselves placed, but on the part which you are to at, that youi Xvelfare or unhappiness, your honour or infamy,, depend. Now, when beginning 4o a& that part, what can be of greater moment, than to regulate your plan of eondu& with the most serious attention, before you have yet committed any fatal or irretrievable errors ? If, initead of exkrting refleaion for this valuable purpose, you deliver yourselves up, at so critical a time, to sloth and pleasure; if you refuse to listen to any counsellor but humour, or to attend to any pursuit except that of amusement; if you allow yourselves to float loose and careless on the tide of life, ready to receive any direc. which the current of fashion may thance to give you; what can you expet to follow from such beginnings ? While many around you are undergoing the consequences of a like indiscretion, for what reason shall not those consequeiqces extend to you ? Shall you only , attain success without that preparation, and escape dangers without that precaution, which is required of others ? Shall -happiness grow up to you, of its own accord, and solicit your- acceptance, .when, to the reft ds mankind, it is the fruit of long cultivation, and the acquitfion of labour and care ?- Deceive riot yourselves with such arrogant hopes.' Whatever be your rank, Providence will not, for your fake, reverse its eftablilied' or * der. The Author of your being hith en joined you to take hebe to your taysj to ponder the paths of your feet; to retmcicr your-Creator in the days of your youth. TBe hath rdecreed, that they only whb tk aster wisdom, Jhall findt  that fidls fatll be iaffidled, because of their tranfgrefions; and that whoso refufetb infiruflion, fall deflroy his own foul. By listening to these admotiitfons, and tempering the vivatity of youth with a proper mixture of fefious thought, you may tenfure cheerfulnets for the reft of life; bat by delivering Your selves up at present to giddiness and levity, you lay the foundation of lalting XL.
heaviness of heart..

When you look forward to those plans of lifei which. either your circumfiances havq suggested, or your friends have proposed, yot will not hesitate to acknowledge, that in order to pursue them with advantage, some previous discipline is requifite. Be assured, that whatever is to be your profefflion, no education is' more .necef8ary to your success, than the acquirement of virtuous- dispositions and habits. This is the universal preparation for every chara&er, and every ftatiotr in life. Badas the world is, refpea is always paid to virtue. In the usual c6urse of human affairs, it will be found, that a plain understanding joined -wIth acknowledged worth, contribute more to prosperity, than the brightest partd without probity or fionour. Whether science, or business, or public life, be your aim, virtue still enters, for a prihoipal share, into all those great departments of society.

Whatever ornamental or engaging'ene dowments you now possess, virtue is A oeceffary requisite, in order to their bin. with proper lustre.

ps6 the mind. These are the qualities whose influence will last, when th6 luflre ofTall that once sparkled and dazzled has , paffd away Let not then the season of youth be barren of improvements, so essential to fyour future felicity and honour. NoW is th6 seed-time of life; and according to what youzow, you fJlall reap. Your charater is now' under Divine assistance, of your own forming; your fate is, in some measure, put into your own hands. Your nature is as yet pliant and soft. Habits ,iave not established their dominion. Prejudices have not pre-occupied your underflanding. The world has not had time to contrat and debase your affe&ions."
"All your powers are more vigorous, difembarrassed, and free, than they will be at any future period. Whatever impulse you now give to your desires and passions, the <liretion is likely to continue. It kill form the channel in which yout life is to run nay, it may determine its ever "
" lasting issue. Confider then the employ . ment of this important period, as the highest truss which shall ever be committed to you; as, in a great measure, decisive of your happiness, in time, and in eternity./ As in the succession of the seasons, each, by the invariable laws of Nature, affeas the produaions of what is next in course; so, in human. life, every period of our age, according as it is well or ill spent, influences the happiness of that which is to follow. Virtuous youth gradually brings forward accomplished and flourishing manhood; and such manhood passes of itself, without uneasiness, into. refpetable and tranquil old age."
"But when Natureis turned out of its regular course, disorder takes place in the moral, just as in the vegetable world. If the Spring put forth no blossoms in Summer there will be no beauty, and in Autumn, no fruit. Soeif youth be trifled away without improvement, manhood will be contemptible, and old age miserable. If the beginnings of life have been vanity, its latter end can be no other than vexation offpirit."
"'Having thus shown the importance of beginning early to give serious attention to conduct, I come, next, to point out the virtues which are most necessary to be cultivated in youth. What I shall, "
"1tXI. RECOMMEND, is piety to God. With this I begin, both as the foundatior of good morals, and as a disposition particularly graceful and becoming in youth, To be void of it, argues a cold heart, deftitute of some of the best affecions which belong to that age. Youth is the season of warm and generous emotions. The heart thould then, spontaneously, rife intq the admiration of what is' great, glow with *the love of what is fair and excellent, and melt at the discovery of tenderners and goodness. .JWhere can any object be found, so proper to kindle those affeaions, as the Father of the universe, and the Author of all felicity?"
"'tnmoved by veneration, can you con "
" template that grandeur and majesty, "
"XL. which his'works every where display?"
"Untouched by gratitude, can you 4view that profusion of good, which, in thii pleasing season of life, his beneficent hand pours around you ? Happy in the love and affetion of those with whom you are conneced, look up to the' Supreme Being, as the inspirer of all the friendship which has ever been lhown you bs others; himself, your best and your first friend; formerly, the supporter of your infancy, and the guide of yodt child, hood; now, the guardian of your youti, and the hope of your coming years."
"View religious homage, as a natural ex."
"pression of gratitude to him for all his goodness. Confider it as the service of the God ofyour fathers; of him, to whom your parents devoted you; of him, whom in former ages your ancestors honouredj and, by whom they are now rewardedi and blessed in heaven. Conneaed with so many tender sensibilities of foul, let religion be with you, not the cold and, "
"barren offspring of speculation, but the warm and vigorous diaate of the heart."
"But though piety chiefly belong to the heart, yet the aid of the underflanding is requisite, to give a proper dire&ion tcd the devout affections. You muff endeavour, therefore, to acquire jufft views, both of the great principles of natural religion, and of the peculiar doarines of the gospel."
"For this end, study the sacred scripfures. Consult the word of God, more than the systems of men, if you would know the truth in its native purity."
"When, upon rational and sober enquiry, you have eltablifhed your principles, susser them not to be ihaken, by the fcoffs ps the licentious, or the cavils of the fceptical. Remember, that in the examination of every great and comprehensive plan, such as that of Christianity, difficulties may be expeced to occur; and that reasonable evidence is not to be reje  because the nature of our present state allows us only to know in part, and to fee through a glass, darkly."
"Impress your minds with reverence soir all that is sacred. Let no wantonness oE youthful spirits, no compliance with the intemperate mirth of others, ever betray you into prophane sallies. Besides the guilt which is thereby incurred, nothing gives a more odious appearance of peti, lance and presumption to youth, than the affetation of treating religion with levi, ty. Instead of being an evidence of fupe riour understanding, it discovers a pert and shallow mind; which, v4in, of the first smatterings of knowlqdge, prefpmes to make light 6f what the reft of mankind At the fame time, you are not to ima gine, that when exhorted to be religious, you are called upon, to become more formal and solemn in your manners thaq others of the fame years, or to ered yourselves into supercilious reprovers of thofq around you. The spirit of true religion breathes gentleness and affability. It'"
"gives a native, unaffeaed ease to the behaviour. It is social, kind, and cheerm ful far removed from that gloomy and illiberal superstition which clouds the ."
"brow, iharpens the temper, dejeas the fpiritj and teaches'men to fit themfelvea for another world, by neglecting the concerns of this. Let your religion, on the contrary, connet preparation for heaven, with an honourable discharge of the duties of aaive life. Let it be associated in your imagination, with all that is manly and useful; with 'uhatfoever things are true, are jufA , are pure, are lovely, are of good report, wherever there is any virtue, and wherever there is any praire. Of fuch'"
"religion discover, on every proper occasion, that you are not ashamed; but avoid making any unnecessary ostentation of it before the world, ,"
"II. To piety, join modesty and docili ty, reverence of your parents, and submission to those whd are your fuperiourst in knowledge, in flation, and in years."
"Dependence and obedience belong to youth. Modesty is one of its chief ornaV1 ments; and has ever been efleemed a pted ., sage of rising merit. When entering on the career of life, it is your parti not to assume the reins as yet into your hands; but to commit yourselves to the guidancq of the more experienced, and to become wife by the wisdom of those who have gone before you."
", Of all the follies incident to youthl there are none which either deform its present appearance, or blast the profpe4 of its future prosperity, more than felfj conceit, presumption, and obstinacy. By checking its natural progress in improvement, they fix it in long. immaturity; and frequently produce mifchiefs, which can never be repaired. Yet these are vices too commonly found among the young, Big with enterprise, and elated by hope, they resolve to trust for success to none but themselves. Full of their own abilh ties, they deride the admonitions which are given them by their friends, as the timorous suggestions of age. Too wife to learn, too impatient to deliberate, too forward to be restrained, they plinge, "
"with precipitant indiscretion, into the midst of all the dangers with which life abounds. Seeft thou a young man wife ir his own conceit ? There is more hope of a fool, than of him.--Pofitive as you now are in your opinions, and confident in youx assertions, be assured, that the time approaches, when both men and things will appear to you in a different light. Many characters which you now admire, will, by and by, fink in your esteem; and many opinions, of which you are at present moit tenacious, will alter as you advance in years. Distrust, therefore, that glare of youthful presumption, which dazzles your eyes. Abound not in your own sense. Put not yourselves forwar4 with too much eagerness; nor imagines that by the impetuosity of juvenile ardour, you can overturn systems which have been long established, .and change the face of the world. Learn not to think more highly of yourselves than you ought to."
"Think, but to think soberly. By patient and gradual progression in improvementt yotl ' may, in due time, command lasting efteent."
"But by assuming at present, a tond of superiority, to which you have no title, you will disgust those whose approbatioh it is most important to gain. Forward vivacity may fit you to be the companions of an idle hour. More solid qualities must recommend you to the wife, and mark you out for importance and confideratiou ih subsequent life."
"IlI. IT is necessary to recommend to you, sincerity and truth. This is the basis of every virtue., That darkness of charater, where we can fee no heart; those boldings of art, through which no native affetion is allowed to penetrate, present an objea, unamiable in every season of life, but particularly odious in youth. If, at an age when the heart is warm, when the emotions are strong, and when nature is expeaed to show itself free and open, you can already smile and deceive, what are we to look for, "
"when you shall be longer hackneyed in the ways of men; when interest shall have ....i pleted the obduration of your heart, and experience shall have improved you in all the arts of guile ? Dissimulation in youth, is the fore-runner of perfidy in old age. Its frft appearance, is the fatal omen of growing depravity, and future fhamq. It degrades parts and learning; obscures the lustre of every accomplishment; and sinks you into contempt with God, and man."
"SAs you-value, therefore, the approbation of Heaven, or the efleem of the world, cultivate the love of truth. In all your proceedings, be direCt and consistent."
"Ingenuity and candour possess the most powerful charm; they bespeak universal favour, and carry an apology for almost every failing. The lip of truth, shall be eflabli/fed for ever ; but a lying tongue, is but for a moment *. The path of truth, is a plain and a safe path; that of falsehood, is a perplexing maze. After the first departure from sincerity, it is not in your  power to flop. One artifice unavoidably - leads on to another; till, as the intricacy of the labyrinth increases, you are leftentangled in your own snare. Deceitdif.-"
"covers a little mind, which flops at tem."
"porary expedients, without rising to comr prehenfive views of condut., It betrays, at the fame time, a dastardly spirit. It is the resource of one, who wants courageto avow his designs, or to reft upon himself. Whereas, openness of characer difplays that generous boldness, which ought to diftinguifll youth. To set out in thd world with no other principle than a crafty attention to interest, betokens one who is destined for creeping through the inferiour walks of life. But to give an early preference to honour above gain, when they fland in competition; to despise every advantage, which cannot be attained without dishonest arts; to brook no meanness, and to sloop to no dissimulation; are the indications of a great mind, the presages of future eminence and diftinaCion ir .life."
"At the fame time, this virtuous sincerity is perfealy consistent with the most pru- I.."
"dent vigilance and caution. It is opposed to cunning, not to true wisdom. It is not the simplicity of a weak and improvident, but the candour of an enlarged and noble mind; of one, who scorns deceit, because he accounts it both base and unprofitable; and who seeks no disguise, because he needs none to hide him. 'Lord! whoJjhall abide in thy tabernacle? Who hall ascend into thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and wvorketh righteousness, and fpeaketh the truth in his heart.
  is the proper season of cultivating the benevolent and humane affe&ions. As a great part of your happinefs is to depend on the conne&ions which you form with others, it is of high importance that you acquire, betimes, the temper and the manners which will render such connetions comfortable. gLet a sense of justice be the foundation of all your social qualities. In your most early  intercourse with the world, and eveq fit _ your youthful amusements, let no unfairl ness be found. Engrave on your mind that sacred rule, of doing in all things So others, *qccording as you, wji that the4, Jhould do unto you./ For this end, inmpreft yourselves with a deep sense of the original, and natural, equality of men. What!
ever advantages of birth or fortune yot possess, never display them with an oftentatious superiority. Leave the fubordii nations of rank, to regulate the intercourse of more advanced years. At present, 4 becomes you to aat among your companions, as man with man. Remember how pnknown to you are the vicissitudes of the world; and how often they, on whom ignorant and contemptuous young men once looked down with scorn, have risen to. be their fuperiours in future years.
SCompaffion is an emotion, of which you ought never to be ashamed. Graceful in youth is the tear of sympathy, and the heart that melts at the tale of ypoe.
Let not ease and indulgence contrac your affe4ions, and wrap you up in felfifh en- ER 
joyimeat. But go sometimes to the house xI fmourning, as well as to the houfe'offeafling, Accustom yourselves to think of the distresses of human life;' of the solitary cottage, the dying parent, and the weeping orphan, Thou Jhalt not harden thy heart, nor jhut thy hand from thy poor brother ; but thou halt firely give unto him in the day of his need: And thine heart jhall not be grieved when thou gives/ unto him; because that for this thing, the Lord thy God jball bless thee in all thy works*. Never sport with pain and distress, in any of your amusements; nor treat even the meanest infea, with wanton cruelty.

In young minds, there is commonly a firong propensity to particular intimacies and friendships. Youth, indeed', is the season wheq friendships are sometimes formed, which not only continue through succeeding life, but which glow to the last, with a tendernels unknown to the connections begun in cooler years. The propensity therefore is not to be difcou, 




 raged; though at the fame time it (nuft XI _ be regulated with much circumfpe0ioa and care. Too many of the pretended friendships of youth, are mere combinae tiona in pleasure. They are often f0undr on capricious likings; suddenly 0on*
trated, and as suddenly dissolved. Sometimes they are the effea of interested comn plaifance and flattery on the one  and of credulous fondness on the other. Be, ware of such rash and dangerous cpnnections, which may afterwards load you with di(honour. Remember, that by thý charader of those whom you choose for your friends, your own is likely to be formed, and will certainly be judged of by the world. Be flowv, therefore, and cautious in contracing intimacy; but when a virtuous friendship is once eflablifhed, confider it as a sacred engagement, Expose not yourselves to the reproach of lightness and inconflancy, which alwayi bespeak, either a trifling, or a base mind.
Reveal none of the secrets of your friend.
Be faithful to his interests. Forsake hin tiot in dangei. Abhor the thought bs ac- SE IM.
quiring any advantage by his prejudice  
or hurt. There is a friend that loveth at all times, and a brother thdt is born for verfity. Thine own friend, and thyfather friend, forsake not '.

Finally, on this head; in order to ren dier yourselves amiable in society, correCt every appearance of harshness in behaviour. Let that courtesy distinguish your demeanour, which springs, not so much from fludied politeness, as from a mild and gentle heart. Follow the customs of the world in matters indifferent; but flop when they become sinful. Let your manners be simple and natural; and of course they will be engaging. Affe6tation is certain deformity. By forming themselves on fantastic models, and vying with one another in every reigning folly, the young begin with being ridiculous, and end in being vicious and immoral.
  LET Ite particularly exhort youth to temperance in pleasure: Let me * prov. xvii. 17.-xxvii. 1o.

\FR  monish them, to beware of that rock on  ' which thousands, from race to race, con tinue to split. The love of pleasure, natural to man in every period of his Jife, glows at this age with excessive ardour, Novelty adds fresh charms, as yet, to eve ry gratification. The world appears to spread a continual feast; and health, vigour, and high spirits, invite them tq partake of it without restraint. In vain we warn them of latent dangers. eligion is accused of infufferable severity, in prohibiting enjoyment; and the ol, when they offer their admonitions, arq, upbraided with having forgot that they once were young.-And yet, my friends, to what do the restraints of religion, and the counsels of age, with refpea to pleasure, amount ? They may all be comprized in few words, not to hurt yourselves, and not to hurt others, by your pursuit of pleasure, Within these bounds, pleasure is lawful; beyond them, it becomes criminal, because it is ruinous.
Are these restraInts any other, than what a wife man would choose to impose on him- sE .

self? We call you not to renounce pleasure, but to enjoy it in fafery. Instead of abridging it, we exhort you to pursue it on an extensive plan. We propose measures for securing its poffeffion, and for prolonging its duration.

Consult your whole nature. Confider yourselves not only as sensitive, but as rational beings; not only as rational, but social; not only as social, but immortal. Whatever violates your nature in any of these refpedts, cannot afford true pleasure; any more than that which undermines an essential part of the vital system, can promote health. For the truth of this conclusion, we appeal, not merely to the authority of religion, nor to the testimony of the aged, but to yourselves and your own experience.
We ask, Whether you have not found, that in a course of criminal excess, your pleasure was more than compensated by fucceeding pain ? Whether, if not from every particular inflance, yet from every habit, 
at least, of unlawful gratification, there did . .- not spring some thorn to wound you, there did not arise some consequence to make you repent of it in the issue ? How long then, yes mple ones! will ye love implicity ? How long repeat the fame round of pernicious folly, and tamely expose yourselves to be caught in the fame snare ? If you have any consideration, 'or any firmness left, avoid temptations, for which you have found yourselves unequal, with as much care, as you would fiun pestilential infeaion. Break off all connetions with the loose and proi fligate. When sinners entice thee, consent thou not. Look not on the wine when it is red, when it giveth its colour in the cup; for at the laJf, it biteth like a serpent, and fJingeth like an adder. Remove thy wiay from the frange woman, and come not *ear the door of her house. Let not thine heart decline to her ways,; for her house is the vway to hell. Thou goefJ after her as a bird bafleth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.

By these unhappy excesses of irregular pleasure in youth, how many amiable -
positions are corrupted or destroyed! How many rising capacities and powers are sup.
pressed! How many flattering hopes of pa.
rents and friends, are totally extinguished !
Who but must drop a tear over human nature, when he beholds that morning which arose so bright, overcast with such untimely darkness; that good humour which once captivated all hearts, that vivacity which sparkled in every company, those abilities which were fitted for adorning the highest flation, all sacrificed at the thrine of low sensuality; and one who was formed for running the fair career of life in the midst of public efleem, cut off by his vices at the beginning of his course, or funk, for the whole of it, into infignificancy .and contempt !-These, 0 sinful Pleasure! are thy trophies. It is thus that, co-operating with the foe of God and man, thou degradeft human honour, and blafteft the opening profpe ts of human felicity.


SER * /  DILIGENCE, indufiry, and propet ~ improvement of time, are material dutiel of the young. To no purpose are they endowed with the best abilities, if they want aaivity for exerting them,,- Utp availing, in this cafe, will be every direcr that can be given them, either for their temporal or spiritual welfare, Ia youth, the habits of industry are moo easily acquired. In youth, the incept tives to it are firongeft, from ambitioc and from duty, from emulation and hope, from all the profpe 'which the pegin, ning of life affords. If, dead to these calls, you already languish in flotbfWl inaaion, what will be able to quicken the more sluggish current of advancing years ?

Industry is not only the instrument of improvement, but the foundation of pleasure. Nothiog is so opposite to the true enjoyment of life, as the relaxed and feeble slate of an indolent mind.
He who is a firanger to industry, mpq possess, but he cannot enjoy. For it is labour only which givei the relish to pleasure. It is the appointed vehicle bs every good to man. It is the indifpenfable condition of our poffefling a found mind, in a found body. Sloth is so inconsistent with both, that it is hard to determine whether it be a greater foe to virtue, or to health and happiness. Inactive as it is in itself, its effets are fatally powerful. Though it appear a slowly flowing stream, yet it undermines all that is flable and flouri(hing. It not only saps the foundation of every virtue, but pours upon you a deluge of crimes and evils. It is like water which first pu-»
trifies by stagnation; and then sends up noxious vapours, and fills the atmosphere with death.

Fly, therefore, from idleness, as the certain parent both of guilt and of ruin.
And under idleness I include, not mere inaaion only, but all that circle of trifling occupations, in which ' too many saunter away their youth; perpetually engaged in frivolous society, or public amusements, in the labours of dress, o4 »- the ostentation of their pqrfons.-I4 tbif the foundation which you lay son fture ufefulnefs and esteem ? By such pcPqm4 pljfhments, do you hope to recqnupend yourselves to the thinking part of the world, and to answer the expeSations of your friends, and your country ,    Amusements, youth requires. It were vain, it were cruel to proihiit themn But. though allowable as the relaxation, they are most culpable as the business, of the young, For they then become the gulf of time, and the poison of thd mind, They foment bad pafions. They weaken the manly powers. They fink the native vigour of youth, into con4 temptible effeminacy.

Redeeming your time from such, dan-q gerous wafite, seek to fill it with employments which you may review with fatiffadion./ The acquisition of knowledgeis one of the most honourable occupations of youth. The desire of it discoversa, liberal mind, and is conne6ted with many accomplishments, and many virtues. 

But though your train of life should not lead you to fludy, the course of education always furnishes proper employments to a well-difpofed mind. Whatever you pursue, be emulous to excel. Generous ambition, and sensibility to praise, are, efpecially at your age, among the marks of virtue. Think not, that any affluence of fortune, or any elevation of rank, exempts you from the duties of application and industry. Industry is the law of our.
being; it is the demand of Nature, of Reason, and God.l2Remember always, that the years which now pass over your heads, leave permanent memorials behind them. From your thoughtless minds they may escape; but they remain in the remembrance of God. They form an importarft part of the regiffer of your life.
They will hereafter bear teflimony, either for or against you, at that day, when, for all your aaions, but particularly for the employments of youth, you must give an account to God.


THUs I have set before you, some of  the chief qualifications which belong to that sober mind, that virtuous and religibus charaaer, which the Apostle in my Text recommends to youth i piety, mqdefty, truth, benevolence, tgmperapce, and industry. Whether your future courfp is defined to be long or flort, after thip manner it should commence; and, if,ý continue to be thus conduted, its Pon, clufion, at what time soever it arriveS will not be inglorious or unhappy. For, honourable age is not thatl which Jflandet4 in length of time, or that which is meat sured by number of years. But wisdom jthe gray hair to man, and an unspotted lifr is old age.
 me finish the fubjea, with recall-ý your attention to that dependence op the blessing of Heaven, which, amidst all your endeavours after improvement, you ought continually to preserve, It is too comatioa with the young, even when they resolve to tread the path of virtue and ho fidence' in themselves. Trusting to their own abilities for carrying them fucceflfully thlotugh fife, they are careless of applying to God, or of deriving any asfiflance from' what' they are apt to reckon the gloomy discipline of religion. Alas!
how littfe do thley know the dangers which await tiem ? Neither human wisdom, nor htman virtue, unsupported by religion, are equal' for the trying situations which often'occur in life. By the shock of temptation, how frequently have the most virtuous intentions been overthrown ? Unler the prffure of disaster, how often has the greatest conflancy funk ? Every good, and every perfeR gift, is from above. Wisdom and virtue, as' well as riches and honour, come from God. Deffitute of his favour, you are in no better situation, with all your boasted abilities, than orphans left to wander in a trackless desert, without any guide to conduc them, or any shelter to cover them from the gathering storm. Corret, then, this ill-founded ar 

 rogance. Expe& not, that your happiness '_ can be independent of him who made youth. By faith and repentapce, apply to the Redeemer of the world. By piety and prayer, seek the protetion of the God of heaven. I conclude with the folerni words, in which a great Prince delivered his dying charge to his son; words, which every young person ought to confider as addressed to himself, and to engrave deeply on his heart. Thou Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy fathers; and serve him with a perfeRl heart, andiwt-~
a willing mind. For the Lord fearcheth all hearts, and underfiandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou seek hbmw he will be found of thee; but if thou forAke him, he will carj thee offor ever*.

# SERMON XII. On the Duties and Consolations of the Aged.

## PROV. xvi. 31. The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.

 fear God, and to keep his command- 

ments, is the rule of our duty, in -

every period of life. But, as the light which guides our fleps, varies with the progress of the day, so the rule of religious condu& is diversified in its application, by the different stages of our present existence. To every age, there belongs a diftind propriety of behaviour.
There arises from it, a series of duties peculiar to itself.

Of those which are incumbent on . ,. youth, I have treated in. the preceding discourse. As,we advance from yputh to middle age, a new field of aaion opens, and a different charaaer is required. jThe flow of gay and impetuous spirits begins to subside: Life gradually assumes a graver cast; the mind, a more sedate and thoughtful turn. The -attention is now transferred from pleasure to interest; that is, to pleasure diffufed over a wider extent, and meafpre4 by a larger scale.. orner ly, the enjoytent of the present mopmnt occupied the whole attention. Now, no SaLion terminates ultimately in itself, but refers to some more distant aim. Wealth and power, the instruments of lfting gratification, are now coveted more than any single pleasure. Prudence and,forefight lay their plans. Industry carries on its, patient efforts. Acivity pushes forward; address winds around, Hereý aa_ enemy is to be overcome; there a rival to be displaced. Competitions warm; and thb firife of the world thickens on every  To guide men throbgh this busy SER MI.

SBut as this includes, in a great mea-1 fire, the whole compass of moral duty; as the general firain of religious exhortatign oi addressed to those who are in this'
feaifonrdf life; a idelineation of the virtlesf, properly belonging to middle age, may appear unnecessary, and would lead ut into too wide a field. Let us therefore tarrr our view to a bounded profpe&; afad contemplate a period of life, the duties of which are circumscribed within narrower limits. Old age is a stage of the human course, which every one hopes to reach4 and therefore the confideratiotf of'it, interests us alL It is a period justly entitled tuo general refpet. Even its failings 6ught to be touched with a gentle hand; and though the petulant, and the sb 4 vain, "
"19 JM. vainm, my defplfe'the h6aj head~ yeIthie eLj » wileft of men has asserted wint thP'Ot  "
"that when found in the -way bs tghieoiffness, it is a crown of glbry. 1 Ihill, 7i  offer, some counsels, concetanig the titdis which are most incident to ihe 6ged. Secondly, I shall suggest the- peculiar diutis they ought to praaife; and, thidly, p6ift anout the consolations they' may enjoy 1 1. As -the folliet and vices of yoth, 
are chiefly derived from inexperince 4ad presumption; so, almost all the errors of age, may be traced up to the feebleness -and diflrefs peculiar to that time of life.
Though, in every part of fifi, vexatiosn .occur, yet, in former years,? eithir bui.
ness, or pleasure, served to obliterate their impression, by supplying occupationlto the mind. Old age begins its adar~ges, With disqualifying men for Telilhing the Sone, and for takirg an a&ive partvin tlhe .6t1her. While it withdraws their ac4uitomed supports, it imposes, at. the, fame time, the additional burden ofi growing ,infirmities. In the former stages of their 9, jou1neyj hope continued to flatter thems =
.:bthAmany a fair and enticing profped.
Afut in proportion as old age increases, -thpfe pleasing illusions vanilh, Life is..antraeed within -a narrpw and barren zsir4oe. Year after year, fleals somewhat AtWay fromn their store of comfort, '"
"prives them of some of their ancient friends, blunts some of their'powers- of sensation, pr incapacitates them. for some bfdnajo of life."
"Io. Though, in the plan of Providence, ,it eis -wifely ordered, that before we are lled away from the world, our attachxment to it should be gradually loosened; though it be fit in, itself, that .as in the day of human life, there is a morning and a noon, so there should be an evening also, when the lengthefiing shadows ihall admonish us of approaching night; yet we have no ,eafon to be surprised, if they who are arrived at this dejeaing fao, feel and lament the chauge which they, fuffer. The complints, - therefore, "
"of the aged, Thould meettwith tenderness, "
"-.-uj rather .thain censure4 The burden under which they labouri ought to be viewed with sympathy, by those who must beat it in their turn, and who perhaps, here."
"after, an complain of it as bitterly. At the fame timee the old should confidet, that all the seasons of life have their feveral trials allotted to them; and that to bear the infirmities of age with becoming patience, is as much their duty, as it is that of the young to resist the temptations of youthful pleasure. By calmly enduring, for the fh6rt time that remains, what Providence is' pleased to inflit, they both exprefsr resignation most acceptable to .God, and recommend rthemfelveis io the efteenm and assistance of all who are mround them, - '"
"But though the cjuertilous temper im puted ito old age, is to be considered is natural infirinity, rather than as a vice the famd apology cannot be made foi* that peevith disgust at the manners, and that malignant censure of the enjoyihentsl of ;he young, which is sometimes found to 8 ER "
"accopmpany declining years. Nothing cad bA more 3njuft, than to take offence at others, on acpount of their partaking of pleafureq, which it is past your time to enjoy. By indulging this fretful temper, ypu both aggravate the uneasiness of age, aqd you alienate those on whose affeftiot'"
"much of your comfort depends. In ordef to make the two extremes of life UnitV in amicable society, it is greatly to, be vilhed, that the young would look forrward, and cpnfider that they shalL one?
day be old; and that the old w6uld lookr back, and remembering that they once'
were young, make proper allowances for the temper and the manners of youth.

But infl;ead of this, it is too common to find the aged at declared enmity witfh the whole.fyfiem of,prefent customs and magnnr§; perpetually complaining of the growipg depprvity of the world, and of the astonishing, vices and follies of the rising gneration. All thbngs, according to them,, are rufhipg fast into ruin. 
1 tint, ever since that happy discipline, 
under which they spent their youth, has passed away.---Part, at least, of this displeasure, ypu may fairly impute to the infirmity of age, which throws its own gloom on every surrounding oqbjec1. 'Si milar lamentations were, in the' days of your youth, poured forth by your fathers; and they who are now young, shall, when it comes to their turn, inveigh, in the like strain, againtf those who fucceea them. Great has been the corruption of the world in every age. Sufficient ground'
there is for the complaints made by ferious observers, at all times, of abounding iniquity and folly. But though particular modes of vice prevail in one agd, more than in'others, it does not follow, that dn that age all iniquity is accumulated.
It is -the form, perhaps, more than the quatity of corruption, which 'makes the diftintion. In the wdRfi of times, God hasaiffuredusr- that there shall be always a feed whoJhall serve hinm Say not thou, 
.ro * Pil. xxii. 30.

What is the caife hat the former days were  better thqn these ? for thou dofj not enquire -,

iely concerning this. Be not righteous over-much ; neither make thyself over- wis *,
Former follies pals away, and, are forgotten. Those which are present, firike -observation, and Iharpen censure. Had the depravation of the world continued to ian crease in proportion to those gloomy calY culations, which, for so many centuries paftG have estimated each race as worse than the precedipg; by this time, not one ray of, good sense, nor one spark of piety and vir.-1 tue, must have remained unextinguifhed among ipankind.

One of the vices of old age, which ap-"
"pears the most unaccountable, is that covetous attachment to worldly interest, with which it is often charged. But this too, can naturally be deduced from the sense of its Feebleness and decay. In proportion as the vigour both of body and mind declines, timidity may he expeaed to increase. With anxioup and fearful eye, the aged look fort  ward- to the evils which thfeater thent, "
"a' nd to the changes which nafay bedal."
"Hence, they are sometimes apt to o4rvalue riches, as the inftrunment of their defence agaiaft these dangers, and as thd most certain means of fecurfng them-' -"
"gainft solitude and difrefped. But though their dpprehenfions may justify a catitious frugality, they can by no means excute a sordid avarice. It is no less absurd, than it is culpable, in the old, from thd dread of uncertain futurity, to deny themselves the enjoyment of the present; and to increase in anxiety about their'"
"journey, in proportion as it draws nearer to its close. There are more effecual methods of commanding refpet from the world, than the mere poffeffion of wealth."
"Let them be charitable, and do good."
"Let them mix beneficence to their friends, witlh a cheerful enjoyment of' the comforts which befit their flate They 'will the rreceive the* returns off real refpd&"
"andl love. Whereas, I by their riches, they procure no more than pretended demonstrations of regard; while their ill- "
"judged parsimony occasions many secret '"
"wishes for their death."
"As increasing years debilitate the bo dy, so they weaken the force, and diminith the warmth of the affeaions. Chillpd by the hand of time, the heart loses that tender sensibility, with which it once entered into the concerns and forrows.of others. It is, in truth, a merciful appqintment of Providence, that as they who fee many days, muff behold many a.fad scene, the impressions of grief upon, their heart should be blunted by being often repeated; and that, in proportion, as their power of advancing the profperty of others decrease, their participation of the misfortupes of others should also lessen. However, as, in every period of life, humanity and friendship contribute to happiness, it is both the duty and the interest of the aged, to cherish the remains of the kind affections; and, from the days of former years, to recall such impressions as may  tend to soften their hearts. Let thenm .  not, from having' uffered much in thp course of their long pilgrimage, becomp callous to the fufferings of others. But, remembering that they flill are men, let them study to keep their heart open to the sense of human woe. Praiifed; in the ways of men, they are apt to be suspicious of. design and fraud; for the knowledge, and the distrust of mankind, too often go together. Let not, how*"
"ever, that wary caution, which is the fruit of their experience, degenerate into craft. Experience ought also to have taught them, that amidst all the falsehood of men, integrity is the best defence; and that he who continueth to the end to walk uprightly, shall continue to walk surely."
"Having thus offered some admonitions concerning the errors most incident to age, I proceed, "
"II. To point out the duties which pecu liarly belong to it."
"r The drft whleln I shall mention) is, a timely retreat from the worfd. In every _ akrt ot life, We are in hazard of being to6 deeply immersed in its cares. But, during  vigofous periods, the iropule of adive spirit, the necessary business of our ftatiori, fatd the affowable endeavours to advanoe Wr fortune by fair industry,* render it difficulo to pbferve due moderation; In old ig>, all the motives of eager pursuit diminilh, The voice of Nature then calls yot $4 leave to others the buffle and contest of the ~Prlds and gradually to disengage y04jffqyes fr a burden, which begins to eqeed, Xopf strength. Having born your jhare of the heat-and labour of the day, let the evening of life be passed in the cool and quiet shade. It is only in the shade, that the virtues of old age can flourish. There, its dutieý are discharged with most success; and here, its comforts are enjoyed with greatest fatisfadtion."
"By the retreat of old age, however, I do nbt mean a total ceffjtion from every worldly employment. There is an error - - in this, as well as in the opposite etreme."
"Persons who have been long harassed with business and care, sometimes imagine, that -when life declines, they cannot make their retirement from the world too complete."
"But where they expeded a delicious enjoyment of leisure and ease, they have often found a melancholy solitude. Few are able, "
"in any period of their days, to bear a f0al abftradion from the world. There remains a vacancy, which they cannot fill up."
"Incapable of being always employed in the exercises of religion, and often little qualified for the entertainments of the understanding, they are in hazard of becoming a burden to themselves, and to all With whom they are conne  It is, therefore, the duty of the aged, not so much to withdraw entirely from wdrldly bhfineis, as to contra& its circle; not so much to break off, as to loosen their communication with adive life. Cbntinuing that train of occupation to which they have been most accustomed, let them purrfue it with less intenseness; relaxing their efforts, as their powers decline- retiring more and more, froth publick 9bfervation, to domestic scenes, and serious thoughts,' till, as the decays - life advarce, the world ihall of itself withdraw to a greater diflance from their yiew-, its objeds ihall gradually yield their place to others of more importance; and its tumults shall found in their ears, -oply like a noise which is heard from afar."
"If it be the duty of the old, to retreat betimes from the fatigue of worldly care, jt is still more incumbent on them, to quit the pursuit of such pleasures as are unsuitable so their years. Cheerfulness, in old age, is graceful. It is the natural p9naomitant of virtue. But the cheerfulpefs of age is widely different from the levity of youth. Many things are allowable in that early period, which$ in maturer years, would deserve cerfure; but yich,, in old age, become both ridiculous and criminal. By awkwardly affeding XI. to imitate the manners, and to mingle in the vanities of the young, as the aged \depart from the dignity, so they forfeit."
"the privileges of gray hairs. But if, by follies of this kind, they are degradedf they are exposed to much deeper blamer by descending to vicious. pleasure, andcontinuing to hover round those sinful gratifications to which they were ohce addiced. Amusement and relaxation the aged require, and may'enjoy. But let them confider well, that by every infemperate indulgence, they accelerate decay; instead of enlivening, they oppress, and precipitate, their declining state. Ease, safety, and refpe&, are the proper enjoyments of age, Within these boinds let it remain, and not vainly attempt to break through that barrier, by which nature has separated the pleasures of youth, from the comforts left to the concluding years of life."
"A material part of the duty of the aged, consists, in fludying to be useful to thes race who are to succeed them. "
"Here opens to them an extensive field "
"in which they may so employ themselves, as considerably to advarice the interest of religion, and the happiness of mankind."
"To them it belongs, to impart to the young the fruit of their long experience; to inftru6t them in the proper condu6t, and to warn them of the various dangers, of life; by wife counsel, to temper their precipitate ardour; and, both by precept and example, to form them to piety and virtue."
"It is not by rigorous discipline, and unrelaxing austerity, that they can maintain an ascendant over youthful minds."
"The constraint which their presence will impose, and the aversion which their manners will create, if the one be conftantly awful, and the other severe, tend to frustrate the effect of all their wisdom."
"They muff assume the spirit of the companion, and the friend; and mix with the authority of age, a proper degree of indulgence to the manners of the young."
"Inflead of lessening the refpe due to  . their years by such condescension, they take the surest method to increase it. Old age never appears with greater dignity than, when tempered by mildness, and enlivened with good humour, itas as the guide and the patron of youth. Reti gion displayed in such a charater, frikes the beholders, as at once ,amiable and venerable. They revere its power, wvbea they fee it adding so much grace to the decays of nature, and shedding so pleating a lultre over the evening of life. The young wish to tread in the fame steps, and to arrive at the close of their days -with equal honour. They listen with attention to counsels, which are mingled with tenderness, and rendered refpetable by gray hairs. For, notwithstanding all its presumption, youth naturally bends before fuperiour knowledge and years."
"Aged wisdom, when joined with acknovledged virtue, exerts an authority over the human mind, greater even than that . hich arises from power and flation. I Jt can check the most forward, abash the most WI profligate, and itrike with awe the molt 1, giddy and unthinking."
"In the midst of their endeavours to be fifeful to others, let not the aged forget those religious employments,' which their own slate particularly requires. The first of these, is, refletion on their past beha-."
"viour, with a view to discover the errors which they have committed; and, as far as remaining life allows, to apply themselves to repentance and amendment.-"
"Long has the world bewildered you in its maze, and imposed upon you by its arts."
"The time is now come, when this great seducer should mislead you no more."
"From the calm station at which you are arrived, sequestered from the crowd of the deceiving and the deceived, review your condua, with the eye of Christians and immortal beings. After all the tumult of life is over, what now remains to afford you solid fatisfaaion ? 'Have you served God with fidelity, and discharged your part to your fellow-creatures with integrity- and a good conscience ? Cart - you look forward, without terrour, to that day which is to dissolve your connedion with this world, and to bring you into the presence of him who made you, in order to give account of your acions ?-The retrofpe& of life is seldom wholly unattended by uneasiness and shame. Though, to the gdod and the bad, it presents a very different scene; yet, to all men, it recalls much guilt incurred, and much time mifpent. It too much resembles the review, which a traveller takes from some eminence, of a barren country, through which he has passed, where the heath and the defar; form the chief profped; diversified only by a fevw scattered spots of imperfea cultivation."
"Turn then your thoughts, to the proper nethods of making your peace with God through Jesus Christ; and implore, from Divine grace, that new heart, and right spirit, which will fit you for 'a better world. Let devotion fill up many of those hours, which are now vacant from worldly business and care. Let your asfetions dwell among divine and immortal objets. In silent and thoughtful meditation, walk as on the shore of that vast ocean, upon which you are soon to embark. Summon up all the confiderations, which should reconcile you to your departure from life; and which may prepare you for going through its last scene, with firmness and decency. Often let your thanksgivings ascend to .God, for that watchful care with which he hath hitherto conduaed you, through the long journey of life. Often let your prayers be heard, that, in what remains of your pilgrimage, he may not forsake you; and that, when you enter into the 'valley of thejhadow of death, he may there support you with his flaf, and defend you with his rod.-Amidft such thoughts and cares, let old age find you employed; be'taking yourselves to a prudent and timely retreat; disengaged, both from the oppreffive load of business, and from the unseasonable pursuit of pleasure; apply, Sipg yourselves to form the succeeding race, by your counsels virtue and wis, dom; reviewing seriously your past life;by repentance and devotion, preparing yourfelves'for a better; and, with hum, ble and manly composure, expeting that hour, which Nature cannot now long des lay. It remains, "
"III. To suggest the consolations whicl belong to pld age, when thus fo4ld in tke way of righteousness."
"I must introduce them with observing, "
"That nothing is rpore reasonable in itself*"
"than to submit patiently to those infirmities of Nature, which are brought on by the increase of years. You knew before, hand what you had to expet, when you numbered the successive Summers and Winters which were passing over ypur ,heads. Old age did not attack you by surprise, nor was it forced upon you against your choice. Often, and earnestly, did you wiih to fee long lif, and many days. When arrived at the desired period, "
"have you any just cause to complain, on account of enduring what the conflitution of bur being imposes on all ? Did you expe6t, that,. for your fake, Providence wasto alter its eflablifhed order ? Throughout the whole vegetable, sensible, and rational world, whatever makes progress towards maturity, as soon as it has ,passed that point, begins to verge towards decay. It is as natural for old age to be frail, as for the corn to bend under the ripened ear, or for the autumnal leaf to change its hue. To this law, all who went before you, have submitted; and all who shall come after you, must yield. After they have flourished for a season, they Ihall fade, like you, when  period of decline arrives, and bow under the pressure of During the whole progress of the hu man course, the principal materials of our comfort, or uneasiness, lie within ourselves. Every age will prove burdensome, to those who have no fund of happiness sE  in their own breast. Preserve them, if you 'I. . could, from all infirmity of frame; begow upon them, if it were possible, perpetual youth; still they would be restless and miserable, through the influence of illgoverned passions. It is not surprising, that such persons are peevish, and querulous,,"
"when bid. Unjuffly they impute to their time of life, that. misery with which their vices and follies embitter every age, Whereas, to good men, no period of life is unsupportable, because they draw their chief happiness from sources which are independent of age or time. Wisdom, piety, and virtue, grow not old with our bodies, - They fuffer no decay from length of days."
"To them only belongs unalterable and unfading youth. Those that be planted in the house of the Lord, Jhall flourih in the courts of our God. They Jhall fill bring forth fruit in old age; theyJhall be fat and ]louri/hing *."
"You can now, it is true, no longer re lith many of those pleasures which once * Pfal. xii. 13, 14. amused amused you. Your sensations are less ."
"quick than formerly; your days more languishing. But if you have quitted the region of pleasure, in return, you possess that of tranquillity and repose. If you are strangers to the vivacity of enjoyment, you are free,' at the fame time, from the pain of violent and often disappointed desire. Much fatigue, much vexation, as well as vanity, attend that turbulence of life, in which the younger 'part of mankind are engaged. ' Amidst those keen pursuits, and seeming pleasures, for which you envy them, often they feel their own misery, and look forward with a wishful eye to the season of calmness and retreat."
"For, on all sides of human life, the balance of happiness is adjusted with more equality than at first appears; and if old age throws some new distresses into the scale, it lightens also the weight of others."
"Many passions, which formerly disturbed your tranquillity, have now subsided."
"Many competitions, which long filled your days with disquiet and frife, are now SER RM at an end. Many.afflidions, wiich once A;rL ^ rent yonr hearts with violent anguish are now softened into a tender emotion, on the remenmbuance of past woe. In the be.,"

From this inftruaive passage of hifto*

ry, the following observations naturally arise. I. That a sense of right and wrong in conduac, or of moral good and evil, belongs to human nature.  That it produces an apprehension, of merited pu.
nifhment, when we have committed evill IlL That although this .inward sentiment be stifled during the season of profperityi yet, in adversity, it will revive. Andi  That whent it revives, it determines us to confider every distress which we susser, from what cause soever it has arifenj as an adual infliaion of punishment by Ieaven. The consideration of these particulars, will lead us to a very serious view of the nature of man, and of the government of God.
 THERE belongs to human nature, at sense of moral good and evil, or a fa 
culty which difiinguifhes right from SE Wrong, in ation and condu&. Theyfaid, .
one to another, 'We are verily guilty.-In an age, when the law was not yet given, when no external revelation of the Divine will subsisted, except what had been banded down among the Patriarchs, from one generation to another; the brethren of Joseph reasoned concerning their condu&, upon the fame moral principles, and were affected by the fame feelings, of which we are conscious at this day.
Such sentiments are coeval with human nature; for they are the remainb of a law, which was originally written in our heart. In the darkest regions of the earth, and among the rudest tribes of men, a diflinaion has ever been made, between just and unjust, between a duty and a crime. Throughout all the intercourse of human beings, these diftinaions are supposed. They are the foundation of the mutual trust, which the tranfactions of life require; nay, the very entertainments of society constantly appeal to them. The Historian,, who fludies to I'. magnify his hero, by representing him as just and generous; the Poet/ who seeks to interest the world in his fitions, by engaging the heart in behalf of distressed virtue; are fufficient to confute the Sceptic, who denies any natural perception of a diftinaion in aaions."
"But though a sense of moral good and evil be deeply impressed on the heart of man, yet it is not of fufficient power to regulate his life. In his present corrupted state, it is both too general to afford him full direCtion in condua, and too feeble to withstand the opposition of contrary principles in his nature; It is ofted perverted, by ignorance and fuperfiition; it is too easily overcome, by passion and defire. Hence, the importance of that Divine revelation, which cbmmunicates both light and strength; which, by the inftrudive dift coveries if makes, and by the powerfiul assistance it fuppliesi it raises man to a fbation, infinitely fuperiour to that which ht poffeffes under the mere light of Nature."
"It is of consequence, however, to "
"nwark, That this revelation necessarily XI'."
"'supposes an antecedent sense bs right atid wrong to take place in the human mind."
"It addresses itself to men, as poffeffed of such a faculty; and, when it commands them, in general terms, to pursue whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are jzf, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, it plainly appeals to the native di&ates of their heart. Nay, unless men were endowed by Nature, with some sense of duty, or of moral obligation, they could reap no benefit from revelation; they would remain incapable of all religion whatever."
"For, in vain were a system of duty prefcribed to them by the word of God; allegiance were in vain required towards their Creator, or love and gratitude enjoined towards their Redeemer; if, previoufly, there was no principle in their nature, which made them feel the obli-."
"gations of duty, of allegiance, and of  gratitude. They could have no ideas cor."
"- responding to such terms; nor any conr viaion, that, independently of fear or interest, they were bound to regard, either him who made, or him who redeemed them.--This, therefore, is to be held as a principle fundamental to all religion, That there is in human nature, an approving or condemning sense of condut ; by means of which, they who have not the law, are a law unto themselves *. They who, from a mistaken zeal for the honour of Divine revelatiod,. either deny the existence, or vilify the authority, of natural religion, ire not aware, that, by disallowing the sense of obligation, they undermine the foundation, on which revelation builds its power of commanding the heart."
". The Text leads us to observe, That one of the cafes in which the natural sense of good and evil operates most forcibly, is, when men have been guilty of injustice or inhumanity. We fawr the angui of our brother foul when he besought us, and , we 'would nat hear, An' inward principle "
"prompts us to do good to. bthers; but sI with much greater authority, it checks and condemns us, when we have-done them injuries. Tbl part of the humar constitution deserves to be remarked, as a signal proof of the wisdom of its Author, and of the gracious provision which he rhas ,made for' the welfare of mankind."
"We are all committed, in some measure, to the care and assistance of one another."
"But ~ur mutual influence reaches much farther with refped to the evils, than with refpe to the enjoyments, of those around us. To advance their prosperity, ia,often beyond our ability; but to in, $fli injuries, is almost always within our power; And, at the fame time, felf-inte*"
"'eft yery frequently tempts us to commit them. With the utmost propriety, therefore, we are so framed, that the influence jos the moral principle should be most ,iuthoritative, in cafes. where its aid is onoft needed; that to promote the happiness of others, flould appear to us as praise-worthy, indeed,' and generousi; ,HL, but that, to abflain from injuring>thea,)"
"thould be felt as matter of the afri&efl duty,-Amidft the distress which thefta, triarchs fuffered in Egypt, had only this fuggeflion occurred,  We saw- our brof .ther beginning to prosper, and we sonq  tributed not to his advancement, tbei; minds would have been more easily quietl  But, when their refletion was, JV4 saw his anguish when he besought us, and we would not bear, then cofnpuntiop turned upon them its flarpeft edge. Iproceed to observe, "
"JI. A our natural sense of right and wrong, produces and apprehension of merited punishment when we have comrn mitted a crime. When it is employed in surveying the behaviour of others, it dif, linguifhes some aaions, as laudable and excellent; and disapproves of others, as evil and base. But when it is dire upon our own condua, it assumes a higher office, and exercises the authority of a2judge. It is then properly termed, . "
"Conscience; and the sentiments which \"
"itawakens, upon the perpetration of a erirhe, are tiled, Remorse. Therefore, said the brethren of Joseph, is this diflrefs come upon ujz behold also his blood is required."
"They acknowledged, not only that they had committed a wrong, but a wrong for which they were justly doomed to fuffer."
"Did not conscience suggest this natural lation between guilt and punishment, the mere principle of approbation, or difapprobation, with refpe& to moral condu&, would prove of small efficacy. For disapprobation attends, in some degree, every conviaion of impropriety of folly."
"When one has aded unsuitably to his interest, or has trespassed against the rules of prudence or decorum, he refleas upon his condud with pain, and acknowledges that he deserves blame, But the difference between the sense of mifcondua, and the sense of guilt, consists in this, That the latter penetrates.much deeper into the heart. It makes the criminal feel, "
"V-yt that he is not only blameable, but justly punishable, for the part which he has aded. With reference to this office of conscience, the inspired writers frequently speak of it, in terms borrowed foro the awful folemnities of judicial proce, dure; as, bearing -witnofs for or againfl ts-; aIccufug ar excfitmg, judging and coun demning. It will be found, that in the language of mOt nations, terms of thq fame import are applied to the operations of conscience; expressing the sense, which all mankind have) of its passing fentenrcq uipon them, and pronouncing rewards or puni'hments to be due to their adions."
"The sense of punishment merited, you?"
"are further to observe, can never be fepa, rated from the dread, that, at some time or other, punimiment shall be actually ini flided. This dread is not confined to the vengeance of man. For, let the fianer evil deeds be ever so thoroughly conceah from the knowledgq of the world, hia inward alarms are not quieted by that consideration. Now, puriffhment is the SERWf."
"faniton .of law. Every law supposes a rightful fuperiour: And therefore, wher cotncience threatens punilhment tb ferret crimes, it manifeflly recognizes a supreme Governour, from whom nothing is hidden. The belief of our being accountable to him, is what the most hardened wickedness has never been able to eradicate. It is a belief which arises, not merely from. reasoning, but from internal sentiment. Conscience is felt to a as the delegate of an invisible Ruler; both anticipating his sentence, and foreboding its execution."
"Hence arise the terrours, which so of ten haunt guilt, and rife in pioportion to its atrocity. In the history of all nations, the Tyrant and the Oppressor, the bloody and the flagitious, have been ever pointed out, as fearful, unquiet, and relless; fubjed to alarms and apprehensions of. an unaccountable Kind. And surely, io live under such disquietude, from lhe Idreadof merited punithment, is already  to undergo one of the most severe punifl I. -ments which human nature tan fuffer.

.When the world threatens us with aity -of its evils, we know the extent, trid-dif-cern the limits of the danger. We fee the -quarter, on which we are, expofed-to its attack. We measure our own strength with that of our adversary; and can .take precautions, either for making refiflance, or for contriving escape. But when an ,awakened conscience places before the inner, the just vengeance of the Almighty, the profped is confounding, because the Sdanger is boundless. It is a dark unknown which threatens him. The arm that is - stretched over him, he can neither fee nor resist. On every  he dreads it; and on every objec which surrounds him, he looks with terrour, because he is confciSous that every objet can be employed -against him as an instrument of wrath.
-No wonder that the lonesome solitude, or the midnight hour, should firike him with horrour. His troubled - mind beholds forms, which other men fee not; and hears voices, which found only in the ER 
igt of guilt. A hand appears to come (forthb and to write upon the wall ,over against him ; as it did of old, in the fight of an -impious monarch. He Jhall find no ease, nor reft. For the Lord Jhall give him a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, sand sorrow of mind: And his life /hall hang in doubt before him ; and he Jhall fear day and night, and have none assurance of his -ife: In the morning heJ 3allfay, Would to Go4 it were even; and at even heJhallfay, Would to God it were morning, for the fear of his heart wherewith he Jhall fear, and for the fight which his eyes Jhallfee, His lifeJhall be 'grievous unto him *.-Adverfity! how blunt are all the arrows of thy quiver, in comparison with those 'of guilt !-But if such be the power of cohscience, whence, it may be asked, comes it to pass, that its influence is not more genreral, either in restraining men from the commission of fin, or in leading them to a timely repentance ? This brings me to observe,; * Dpot. xxviii. '65,-66, 67. Ifa.  4.

  THAi , durifg a course ,of profpet i- I rity, the operations of conscience- are of1 ten suspended; and that adversity is the season which restores them to their pro per force. At the time when crimes ar
committed, the mind is too much heate&
by paflion, and engrossed by the object of its pursuit, to be capable of proper reflection. After this tumult of spirits haar subsided, if a train of new passions be at hand to employ its ,aivity, or a (uccefsion of pleasurable objeas occur to en--
gage its attention, it may for a while retnain, though not entirely free from inward misgivings, yet unconscious of the degree of its guilt. Dissipated among the amusements of life, the finner escapes, in some measure, from his own view. If he reflets upon himself at all, the continuance of prosperity seems to him a firong jtflification of his conduct. For it will be-found, that in the.hearts of all men, there is a natural propensity, to judge of the favour of the Supreme Being, from the course of external events. When they are born with a smooth gale along the flream of life, and behold every thing 1 proceeding according to their wish, hardly can they be brought to believe, that Providence is their enemy. Balking in the fun-Thine of prosperity, they suppose themselves to enjoy the smile bs indulgent Heaven; and fondly conclude, that they are on terms of friendflip, with all above, and with all below. Easy they find it, then, to spread over the grossest crimes, a covering, thin, indeed, and flight, yet fufficient to conceal them from a superficial 'view.

Of this we have a very remarkable in fiance, in those brethren of Joseph, whose history we now confider. Not only from the silence of the inspired writer, we have -ground to believe that their remorse was ftified, while their prosperity remained; but we are able to trace some of the presences, by which, during that period, they quieted their minds. For when they -were contriving the destruCtion of Joseph, we find Judah saying to his brethren,  ER1. What profit  it, if we flay our brotheA, - and conceal 1is blood? Let us fell him to the bmaelites; and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, and our fieh:
tAnd his brethren were content . Here you behold them justifying their drime, by a fort of pretended humanity , and making light of felling their brother for a slave, because they did not take away his life. How firangely are the dpinions of men altered, by a change in their cordition! How different is this sentiment of the Patriarchs, from that which they afterwards entertained of the fame ation, whed, as you fee in the Text, the remembrance of it wrung their hearts with ariguifh ? , 4 But men, in truth, differ as much from themselves, in prosperity, and in adverfity, as if they were different creatures.
In prosperity, every thing tends to flatter and deceive. In adversity, the illusions of life vanish. Its avocations, and its pleafures, no longer afford the finner that 'fhelter he was wont to find from confi * Gen. xxxrii. 26, 27.



ence, Formerly, he made a part of the crowd. He now feels himself a solitary individual, left alone with God, and with his own mind. His spirits are not supported, as before, by fallacious views of the favour of Heaven. The candle of the ,ord shines not on his head; his pride is humbled; and his affeaions are foftencd for -receiving every serious impression. In this situation, a man iniquity is sure to find him dut. Whatever has been notorioufly criminal in his former condu&,
rises as a fpetre, and places itself before him. The increased sensibility of his mind, renders him alive to feelings which lately were faint; and wounds which had been ill healed, bleed afresh. When men take the timbrel and the harp, and rejoice at the found of the organ, they fay, What is the Almighty that we fjouldferve him ? But when they are holden in the cords of afliEtion, then he Jfjeweth them their work, and their tranfgrefion, that they have exceeded. He openeth also their ears to discipline; and commandeth, that they return from iniquity.

Hence, we may perceive the great ufre XI fulness, and propriety, of that iritel change of conditions, which takes place'
in human life. By prosperity, Cod gives scope to our passions, and makeg trial of our dispositions. By adversity, he revives the serious principle within. Neither theone, nor the other, could be born entire and unmixed. Man, always profperouas would be giddy and insolent; always asflifted, would be sullen and despondent.
Hopes and fears, joy and fo:row; are, therefore, so blended in his life, as both to give room for worldly pursuits, and to recall, from time to time, the admonitions of conscience. Of the proportion in which they should be mixed for this purpose, we arevery incompetent judges.
From our ignorance of the degree of difcipline, which the spiritual tate of others requires, we often censure Providence unjustly, for its severity towards them:
And, from the vanity and rafhnets of our wishes,. we complain,' without reason, of Its rigour to ourselves. While we consult nothing but our ease, God attends to our spiritual improvement, ,
When we seek what is pleasing, he sends what is useful. When, by drinking too deep of worldly prosperity, we draw in a secret poison, he mercifully infuses a me-; dicine, at the time that he troubles and embitters the waters. It remains now observe,   THAT when conscience is though  
roughly awakened, it determines the finner, to confider every calamity which he fuffers, as a positive infliaion of pu, nifhment by Heaven. As it had before alarmed him with threatenings of Di.
vine displeasure, it tells him, when he falls under distress, that the threatened day of account is come. Affliaions, or some occasions, rife direaly out of our fins, Thus, diseases are brought on by intemperance; poverty - springs from idleness; and disgrace, from prefumption. In such cafes,. the punishment. is so closely conneded with the crime, that .SERM. it is imponfible to avoid difceroing the XIII. relation which the one bears to hIq other. But the appointment  Providence, which we now copfider, reaclhee farther than this. God has framed is so, that distresses, which have io perceivable connecion with our formecr crimesj are, nevertheless, interpreted Py conscience, to be infliaed on their account, They force themselves upon our apprehen}
sion, under this view. They are ,nade ýq carry, not only that degree of pain whichl properly belongs to themselves, but thaq additional torment also, which arises from the belief of their being the vengeance of the Almighty.

Let a man fall unexpeaedly into some deep calamity. Let that calamity be brought upon him, either by means which the world calls fortuitous; or by a train of incidents, in which his own mifconduQ, or guilt, has apparently had no part; yet one of the firfL queflionsi which, in such a situation, he puts t0 himself, is, What .have, I done to 

serve this ? His reflecion is, almost SE  
ffindively, drawn back upod his former -
life and if, in the course of that retrofpet, any flagrant guilty deed occur'
to, fmifd his conscience, on this he cannot avoid reffing with anxiety and terroui, and conneaing it in his imaginatIon with what he now fuffers. He fees, or thinks that he fees, a Divine arm lifted np , and what, in other circumflances, 
he would have called a reverse of fortune, he now views as a judgment of Heaven.

When the brethren of Joseph, confined in the Egyptian prison, were bewailing the distress into which they had fallen, there was no circumstance which pointed out any relation between their present misfortune, and their former cruelty to their brother. A long course of years had intervened, during which they flourished in wealth and ease. They were now far from the scene of their crime; in a foreign land, where they believed them*
selves utterly unknown, and where they  bad done nothing to offen4. cu Con science formed a connection betweeq events, -which, according to the. gr4ip nary apprehenfioan of men, were entirev ly independent,of each other.

Pious men, there is no doubt, are at all times disposed to look up to CJod, and to acknowledge his hand in every event of life. 'But what I now observe, is, That where no habitual acknowledgment of God takes place; nay, where a daring contempt of his authority has prevailed, conscience, nevertheless, constrains men, in the day of their distress, to recognize God, under the most hwful of all charaters, The avenger of past guilt.

Herein the wisdom of God appears -in such a light, as jufily to claim our highest admiration. The ordinary course of his Providence, is carried on by hu*
tnan means. He has fettled a train of events, which proceed in a regular fuc.

SS 0o the train of thought which the Text has suggested, several inferences naturally follow. But I shall confine myself to two, which claim your particular attention.

The first is, the clear evidence which the preceding observations afford, of a Divine government now exercised over mankind. This most important and awful of all truths, cannot be too often prefented to our view, or too strongly impressed on our mind. To the imperfet tonvi&ion of it, which obtains in the world, must be ascribed, in a great measurd, the& prevalence of fin. Did men firmly believe, that the Almighty Being, who formed them, is carrying on ax yfy ^ ., i - ter of adminifiration which wilt, po leave guilt unpunished, it is imppfibl8 that they could remain so jqattentiveSj we often behold them, to their moral condua. But the bulk of mankind are giddy and thoughtless. Struck by the superficial appearances of pleasure, AcI accompany licentiousness, they inquire no farther; and deliver themselves up to their senses, and their passions. Where3 as, were they to refled, but for a moment, upon that view which has now been given of human nature, they might focn be satisfied, that the moral govgrnment of God is no matter of douibtfuk difcufflon. It is a fad, no less obvious and incontestable, than the government exercised by those earthly rulers, whom we behold with the ensigns of their office before our eyes.

To govern, is to require a certait course of acion, or, to prescribe a law and to enforce that law, by a suitable diflribution of rewards and punishments.

Now,^ GSd has not only- invested SEB "
"fciehce, as we have seen, with authority to 1promulgate, but endowed it also with owwei~ io etforce, his law. By placing iitwarf approbation and peace on the of virtue, he gave it the fanaion of reward. But this was not enough. Pain is a more powertul principle, than pleasure. To escape misery, is a stronger motive for a&ion, than to obtain good."
"God, therefore,'fo framed human nature, that the painful sense of ill-defert thould attend the commission of crimes; that this sense of ill-defert should necessarily produce the dread of puni(hment; and that this dread should so operate on the mind, in the time of distress, as to make the finner conceive Providence to be erigaged against him, and to be concerned in nflicting the punishment which he fuffers. All these impressions he hath stamped upon the heart with his own hand. Ife hath made them constituent parti of our frame; on purpose, that by the union of so many strong and pungent fentinments, he might enforce repentaoce - ' and reformation, and publish to the hu man race his detestation of fin. Wete he to speak to us from the clouds, his voice could not be more decisive. What ve discern to be interwoven with the contexture of human nature, and to peryvde the whole course of human,affairs, carries an evidence not to be resifted. We might, with as much reason, doubt whether the fun was intended to enlighten the earth, or the rain, to fertilize it; as whether he,,"
"who thus framed the human mind, intended to announce righteousness to mankind, as his law."
"THE second inference which I make from the foregoing discourse, refpeds the intimate connecion, which those operations of corfcience have, with the peculiar. and diflinguifhing doarines of,'the Gospel of Christ. They will be found to accord with them so remarkably, as to furnilh an answer to some of those objetions, which superficial reafoners are ap -to raise against the Christian revela- SBaM.-"
"tion, In particular, they coincide with ._ that awful view which the Gospel gives us, of the future consequences of guilt."
"If the finner is now constrained by conscience, to view the Almighty as pursuing him with evil for long-forgotten crimes, how naturally must he conclude, that, in subsequent period of existence, the Divine administration will proceed ilpon the fame plan, and complete what hha been left imperfect here ? If, during this life, which is dnly the time of trial, the displeasure of Providence at fin is displayed by tokens so manifest, what may be apprehended to follow, when justice, which at present only begins to be executed, shall be carried to its consummation What conscience forebodes, revelation verifies; affuiring us, that a day is appointed, when God will render to every man according to his works; to them, who by patient continuance in welldoing, feekfor glory, honour, and immortality ; eternal lfe: But- unto them that'are SER I contentious, and obey not fh truth, bulýoble 11 unrighteoufnefi; indignation and- wra4h, "
"tribulation and anguijh, upon every fpu 6f man that doth evil, of the Jew frf ta4 also of the Gentile. For there is nq rfpfi of perons with God. For as Viany as hbqf , inned without the law, Jhall alIo perih - without the laei; and as many ps have finned in the law, jhall be judged by law *."
"While the threatenings of confcincc thus strengthen the evidence of the feri ture do&rine concerning future puqlihments, they likewise pave the way for the belief of what is revealed concerning the method of our deliverance by Christ."
"They suggest to the finner, fote deepl and dark malignity contained in guilt, which has drawn upon his head such high displeasure from Heaven. The
call forth his most anxious efforts, to avert the effeLs of that displeasure, ana to propitiate his offended judge. gom |

IHence mankind have constantly fled for refuge td such fubflitutions, as they could ife t6 placl in the room of the offenderi and, as by general consent, vitims have every here been Aain, and expiatory fa-'
renices have been offered up' on innumerable altars. 'Wherewith Jhall I come be fore the Lord, and bow myfIf before the mnof high God? Shall I come before him wiith burnt offerings, and calves of a year old?
Witl the Lord be pleased with thousand; of rams, or with ten thousand of rivers of oil?
10r, fJal[ give my fir-born for my tranfgreffon; the fruit of my body, for the jin of my foul*? There perplexities and agitations of a guilty conscience, may bj termed preludes, in some measure, to thq Gospel of Christ. They are the pointingg of unenlightened Nature, towards thai method of relief, which the grace Po God haa provided, Nature felt its inabi * Micah  6, 7-. I ERM. lity to extficate itself fromt the confe.
 quences of guilt: The Gospel reveals the plan of Divine interposition and aid.

Nature confeffed some atonement to be necessary: The Gospel discovers, that the necessary atonement is made. The remedy is no sooner presented, than i4 suitableness to the disease appears; and the great myflery of redemption, though it reaches, in its full extent, beyond our comprehension, yet, as far as it is revealed, holds a visible congruity with the sentiments of Conscience, and of Na 
Natural and revealed religion proceed from the fame Author; and, of course, are analogous and confiften. They are parts of the fame plan of Providence, They are conne&ted measures of the fame system of government. The serious belief of the one, is the best preparation for the reception of the other. Both concur in impressing our mind with a deep sense of one most important truth, 

which is the result of this whole 
course, That as we sow now, we mufl .XIII reap; that dnder the government of God, no one shall be permitted, with impunity, to gratify his criminal pas-,
fions, and to make light of the great duties of life.

# SERMON XIV. On the Mixture of Joy and Fear in Religion.

## PSAL.   Rejoice with trembling.



On ghe Mixture of Jo and FE , 4ti Rejoice with trembling.TO and Fear, are two great fpringi XIV. of human aaion. he mixed condition of this world, gives scope for both; and, according as the one or the other predominates, it influences the ge-.
neral tenour of our condua. Each of them poffeffes a proper place in religion.
To serve the Lord with gladness, is the exhortation of the Psalmist David*. To serve him with reverence and godly feaA, is the admonition of the Apostle Paul 
But, under the present, imperfetioti of SPfal.  2. $ Heb. xii. z8.

human nature, each of these principles may be carried to a dangerous extreme.
When the whole of religion is placed in joy, it is in hazard of rising into unwarxantable rapture. When it rests altogether on fear, it degenerates into fuperftitious servility. The Text enjoins a due mixture of both; and inculcates this important maxim, That joy, tempered with fear, is the proper disposition of a good man. In discoursing of this fubjet, I Thall endeavour to show, first, That joy is effentiaK to religipn; and next, That, for various reasons, this joy ought to be mixed with fear; whence we hiall be able t9 ascertain the nature of that steady and composed spirit, which is most suit, able to our present condition, and most acceptable to God.

I. Joy is essential to religion, in two refpeQsj; as religion inspires joy, and as it ;rquire§ it. In other words; To rejoice, iq both the privilege, and the duty, of good men.

IN the first place, Religion inspires joy.

XIV It affords just ground of gladness, to all who firmly believe its doarines, and fmn-cerely study to obey its laws: For it conw fers on them, the two most material re.
quifites of joy; a favourable situation of things without, and a proper ifpofitioi of mind within, to relish that favourable situation. '

When they examine their fituatiott without, they behold themselves placed in a' world, which is full of the iafluence of a gracious Providence; where beauty and good are every where predo, minant; where various comforts are beitowed; and where, if any be with-held, they have reason to believe, that theyare with-held by parental wisdom.. Among the crowd that encompass them, they may be at a loss to discern, who are their friends, and who their enemies.
But it is fufficients to know, that they are under the protection of. an invisible Guardian, whose power tan keep them from every evil. All the flops of his conduct, they may be unable to trace. 


Events may befall them, of which they can give no account. But as long as they are satisfied, that the system of Divine government is founded on mercy, rid present occurrences are able to defiroy their peace. For he who spared not his 6tin Son, but delivered him up for them, how Jhall he not with him freely give them all things? If their nature is frail, Divine affiflance is promised to strengthen it. If their virtue is imperfet, a difpenfation is opened, which gives them the hope of pardon. If their external circumftances be in any refpea unfavourable, it is because a higher interest is consulted. All things, they are assured, Jhall wbork together for their good. On their prosperity rests, the blessing; on their adversity, the fanaifying Spirit, of the Almighty. Old age may advance, and life decay; but beyond those boundaries of Nature, faith opens the profpe& of their lasting felicity. Without anxiety, they pass through the different periods of their present existence, becauf=
~ they know it to be no- more than an inotr plu&ion to immortality, * As such a situation of thintgs without lays a solid foundation for joy; tb the disposition which religion forms withiti promotes the relish of it. It is indeed from within, that the chief source .of enjoyment or trouble rife. The' tninds of bad men are always disorderly; hnd hence their lives are so generally uneasy.
In vain they take the timbrel and the harp, and endeavour to rejoice at the found afthe organ. Spleen and disgust pursue them, through all the haunts of amusement, Pride and ill humour torment- them.
Oppressed with discontent, their spirits flag; and their worn-out pleasures afford them entertainment no more. But religion subdues- those malignant passions, which are the troublers of human. repose i which either overcast the mind with the gloom of peevishness, or disquiet 'it-by the violence of agitation. It irifutes Ita -their roome those mild and gentle difpo.


fitiohs, whose natural effect is to smooth ER .
the tehour of the fouL Benevolence and candour, moderation and temperance, ,wherever they reign, produce cheerfulpefs and serenity. The confcioufuefs of integrity, gives ease and freedom to the Inied, Jt enables good men to extra&
from every objet, the whole fatisfadion which it is capable of yielding; and adds the flavour of innocence, to all their. external pleasures.

IN the -second place, As religion natu rally inspires joy; so, what it inspires, it commands us to cheriih. As a necessary proof of our sincerity, it requires cheer*
fulness in the performance of our duty ,because, if this be wanting, our religion discovers itself, not to be genuine in priaSiplei and in practice it cannot be fiable.

Religious obedience, destitute of joy, is mnot genuine in its principle. For, did either faith or hope, the love of God, or the love of goodness, rule the heart; they could not fail to produce fatisfadion   In piety and virtues I Allr those caufet _.., joy which I have dientioned, would, theb operate; and their native- effe& loti the mind, would follow. The profpeb which religion opens,'; would gladden, and the affetior whieh it inspires, would fobth the hearte. We serve, with pleasure, the benefactor' whoi ''ie love.
We rejoice in every fludy and purfui4, 'to which we are sincerely attached. If we serve not God with pleasure, i! is because we know him not, or lovq hii not. If we rejoice not in virtue, it is because our affeaior is alienated froih it, and our 'inclinations are depraved. 
give too evident proof, that either ,we believe not the principles of rHlgion, 'or that we feel 'hot theit power. ,Ettdude joy from religion; and you leave no>
other motives to it, except compulsion and interefbt But are these suitable grounds, on which to reft the whole'of our' obedience to the -Supreme Being .My son, give me thy heart' is the call of God. 'Surely if there be no pleasure in fulfilling hi I c6thnimndE, the heart is sot -given hiFMs athd, ith that cafe, the multi- .
fuderTof 3farifce., aHi burnt oferings, is brtought to his altar( in vain.

As religion, destitute bs joy, is imperfet in its prinaiple 1 fc, in praaice, it muft-be instable. In vain you endeavour to fix any -man to the regular performance of that, in whitch hd finds no pleasure. Bind him eVer so fast by interlft or fear, he will contrive some method of eluding the obligation.
Ingenuity is never so fertile of evasions, as *where pleasure is all on the one  and mere precept on the other. He may fludy to save appearances. He may dissemble Sand confirain hipTfelf. But his heart reVolts in secret; and the weight of inclination will, in the end, draw the practice * after it. If perfeveran is not to be expeded, fill tess can zeal be looked for, .from him, who, in his religious duties, trembles without rejoicing. Every attempt towards virtue -which he forms, will be feeble and awkward. He applies to it as a talk; he dreads the task-master; but Ee 2 Je he will labour no more than necetfy enjoins, To escape from punifhmept, his sole aim. He bargains for immunity, by ,every duty which he performs; and all beyond, he esteems superfluous toil.
-Such religion as this, can neither purify the heart, nor puepare for heavenly bliss. It is the refuge of an abje6t mind.
It may form the ritual of the monk, or prescribe the penance of the idolater; but has no concern with the homage of him, who 'worJhips the Father inspirit and in truth. His character is, that the jo es the Lord is his Jfrength *. It attaches his heart to religion. It inspires his zeal. It -supports his conflancy; and accelerates -his progress.

There is no man, but has some obje&

to which he cleaves for enjoyment; someiwhat that flatters him with distant hopi, or affords him present pleasure. Joy is the end towards wh)ch all rational beings tend. For the fake of it,: they live; it resembles the air they breath, which is necessary for the motion of the heart, 
Ind all the vital functions. But as the 4 breathing of infeaed air proves fatal to site; in the fame manner, joy drawn from a corrupted source, is deftruaive, both of virtue, and of true happiness, When you have no pleasure in goodftefs, you may with certainty conclude the reason to be, that your pleasure is all derived from an opposite quarter.
You have exhausted your affeaion upon the world. You have drunk too much of its poisoned waters, to have any relish for a. pure spring.
' Estimate, therefore, the genuineness of your religious principles; estimate the degree of your liability in religious practice, by the degree of your fatisfaaion in piety and virtue. Be allured, that where your treasure is, there will your delight be allo. The worldly man rejoices in his pofleffions; the voluptuous, in his pleafires; the, social, in his friends and companions. The truly good man rejoices in doing jufily, loving mercy, and walking 8 A  humly fuith the Lord his Cod. Hb haps i-..i py, when employed in the reghlat difr Charge of the great duties of life, poti taneous they flow from the affe&i6ris oefd pure heart. Not only from the keepieg'

Whom have I in heaven but thee? And-therd it none upon earth that I desire beides thee.
They did not receive the Jpirit of bondage but the sprit of adoption. They were filed *with peace and joy in believing. They re joiced in hope of the glory of God. As s6oo as the /Ethiopian eunuch received frotI Philip the light of the Gospel, that light revived and cheeredJhis heart. A new furn seemed to arise a new glory, to (hina around him. - Every objet brightened ;' 
and ha -went. on his way rejoicing *. After the fame manner should every good man, proceed in his journey through life, wit4, a, serene and cheerful spirit. Confl~rna-,
tioq and deje&ion let him leave to the slaves of guilt, who have every thing to dread, both from this world and the next. If he appear before others with adispirited afpea, he dishonours religion; and affords ground for suspicion, that he is either ignorant of its nature, or a firanger to its power.

Thus I have shown joy to be essential to religion. It is the spirit which it inSpires, and which it requires, in good men. But in our present slate, the best principles may be carried to a dangerous excess; and joy, like other things, has its due limits.. To serve God with unmixed delight, belongs to more advanced spirits in a happier world. In this region of imperfeaion, some infusions from a different cup, must of necessity tinaure our joy, Let ua then, 


 RRM.  TURN to the other of the argtr - --. -ment, and confider the reasons which ren, 
der it proper, that when -we rejoice, liould rejoice with trembling.

In the first place, because all the ob jeas of religipn, which afford ground for joy, tend to inspire, at the fame time, ix-verence and fear. We serve a Benefator, it is true, in whom we have reason to delight; whole purposes are gracious ; whose Jaw is the plan of our happiness. But this Benefacor, is the King eternal, immortil, and inv/fible; at whose presence, the hiourr.
tains shake, and Nature trembles. EVery good, and every perfel gift, come down from him. But the hand which confers them, -we cannot fee. Mysterious obscurity rests upon his essence. He dwelleth in thefecrtt place of thunder and clouds and darknkfs surround him. He is the Hearer ofprayer; but we lift our voice to him from afar.
Into his immediate presence no dcces' is permitted. Our warmest devotion admits no familiarity with him. God is in hewtu, qnd though up on earth ; therefore, let fby Jrordr be^fe ' If his omniscience admi- 
nifterf comfort in our secret distress, it -Jikewife fills with awe the heart that is conscious of guilt. For, if he knots our frame and remembers are durj; our ini ittiea, alfd, are ever before him our secret fins, in the light of his countenance.

Tfhroughout all his difpenfations, great sefs, in conjun6ion with goodness, strikes our view; and, wherever we behold the Parent, we behold the Legislator also. The death of Christ, in behalf of a guilty -world, is the chief ground of religious hope and joy. But it is no less the ground of reverepce; when, in this high tranfa.ion, weý-contemplate God, as at once firi6 in justice, and great in mercy. I the Lord keep mercy for thousands of them that fear me. Iforgive their iniquity, tranfgrejion, and fin; but I will by no means clear the guilty. When we open the book of the Law, we find promises and threatenings mingled in the fame page. On the ,bne  we fee Heaven displayed in all its glory: On the other, Hell opening 9 41, its terrours.- In short6 in whatever lighk we view religion, it appears folem~a a~4 venerable. It is a temple full of majetyL tp which the worshippers may 4pproachl wi comfort, irn the hope of optaixing.
grace, cMd fnding mercy; but where tley cannot enter, without being impreffe4 with awe. If we may be permitted to compare spiritual with natural .hings, religion resembles not those scenes of(
natural beauty, where every objea smiles, It cannot be likened to the gay landscape,,
or the flowery field. It resembles more the august and sublime appearances of Nature; the lofty mountain, the expanded ocean, and the tarry firmament; at the fight of which, the mind is- at once overawed and delighted; and, from the union of grandeur with beauty, derives a pleasing, but a serious, emotion.

IN the second place, As joy, tempered by fear, suits the nature of religion, so it is requisite for the proper regulation od the condu6t of man. Let his joy flow from the best and purest source; yet, if it 


remain long unmixed, it is apt to become dangerous to virtue. As waters which are never stirred, nor troubled, gather a sediment, which putrifies them; so the undisturbed continuance of placid sensations engenders disorders in the human foul. It is wifely ordered in our present slate, that joy and fear, hope and grief, should a6 alternately, as checks and balances upon each other, in order to prevent an excess in any of them, which our nature could not bear. If we were fubje6 to no alarms of danger, the wisest would soon become improvident; and the mQft humble, presumptuous.
Man is, a pilgrim on earth. Were his path to be always smooth and flowery, he would be tempted to relinquish his guide, and to forget the purpose of his journey. Caution and fear are the fthelds of happiness. Unguarded joy begets indolence; indolence produces fecurity; security leads to rashness; and rashness ends in ruin, In order to re $ ER  joice long, it is necessary that wS rejpice MXIV. with trembling. Had our first parents pbferved this rule, man might have been fill in paradise. He who faith in hip hearý, My mountain flandý Jtrong I hall never be moved; may be assured, that his slate already begins to totter. Religiq1q therefore, performs a kind qffice, iq giv, us the admonition of the Text. It inspires cheerfulness in the service of God. It proposes joy, as our chief spring of afion. But it supports joy, by guarding it with fear; not suppressing, but regulating its indulgence; requiring us to rejoice, like persons who have obtainea a treasure, which, through want of vigtlance, they are exposed to lose. Dependent beings are formed for fubmii-"
"'sion; and to submit, is to stand in awe."
"Because the Lord reigneth, let the earth be glad. We are the fubjeas of God; and therefore may juffly rejoice. But fill we are fubjeds; and,' therefore, trembling muff mix itself with our joy."
"I I the third place, The unstable condi- ERs XIV."
"tion of all human things, naturally inspires fear in the midst of joy. The spirit to which religion forms us, must undoubtedly correspond to the slate in :which we are placed, and to the part 'which is assigned us to a&. Now, the first view under which our present slate appears, is that of fallen creatures, who are undergoing, in this world, probation ýnd trial for their recovery; and are commanded to work out their salvation *withfedr and trembling. This view of our condition infers not habitual deje&ion of mind. It requires not melancholy abftradion from the affairs, or total contempt of the amusements, of life, But it inspires humility. It enforces dppendance on Divine aid; and calls forth the voice of supplication to Heaven. In a situation to critical, and where interests so important are at stake, every reasonable person must confess, that seriousness ought to temper rejoicing.- Weere there in human life any fixed -.- point of flability and reft, httainable by man; could we, at any one moment, tf.."
"'sure ourselves, that there remained ti6 latent source of danger, either to our temiporall or our spiritual state; then, I ad4 mit, we might lay trembling aide, anl rejoice in full security. 1ýBut; alas! no such safe station, no futh moment ps tonfidence, is allowed to mnan during liit warfare on earth. VicilHitudes of good and evil, of trials and cbnfolations, fill up his life. The best intentioned are sometimes betrayed into crimes; the most prudent, Overwhelmed with misfortines."
"The world *is like a -wheel incessantly "
"Volving, on which human things tlterL nately rife and fall. What is past of our life, has been a chequered scene. On its remaining periods, uncertainty and darkness reft. Futurity is an unknown atgion, into which no man tan look forward without awe, because he cannot'tell what forms of danger or trial tiay meet him there. This we know well, that, in tvery period ds our life, the path of hap- Sg rM -pinef'fhall be found steep and arduous; XIV."
"but swift and easy, the defcdnt to ruinm What,' with much exertion of care and ,igilance, we had built up, moe unwary a'ion may, in an evil hour, 'overthrow."
"The props of human donfidence are, irt rgeneral, insecure. The sphere of human .pleasures is narrow. i While we form ifchenmes for ftrengtheninge the one, and for enlargirg the other, death, mean- bhilei advances. Life, ewith a 4wiif, "
"though insensible course, glides awray; ,and, like a river hich andermines its banks, gradually impairs our slate. Year -after year fleals something from 'us; till the decaying fabric totter bs itself, and -crumble at length into duff. So that, -wfiether we confider life or death, time or eternity, all things appear to concur it giving to man the admonition of the Text, Rejoice with trembAni."
"SI HAVE niow thowni in what refpedas religion both promotes joy, and inspires 3 fcrioufnefs."
"S ERM. feriopfnefs. It places us in the most fa .vourable situation, whichq haman life if fords, for joy and it gives us every af-
fiftance, for relishing that joy. 'It renders it our duty, to cultivate the ftisfa6tion which it yields. It demaridq a cheerful spirit, in order to *ascertain the sincerity of our principles, aad to confirm us in good 'pracice. 'At. the fame' time, the jo5 which it inspires, is tempered with fear, by the genius of religion itself; by the dangers to which unguarded joy would expose us and by the impropriety 'of indulging it, in'a situation so mixed as the present. The trembling which is here -enjoined, is not to be understood as fignifying a pusillanimous dejeaion. It imports no more than that caution and to . briety, which prudence diaates, as 'be longing to our slate.- By conneeting such trembling with our joy, religion means to recommend to us, a' cheerful, but a composed, spirit, equally remote from the -humiliating depression of fear, andSthe xexlting levity of joy, Always, to re 
joice, is to be a fool. Always tQ tremble, 
is to be A slave. It is a modest cheerful- xlv.'
pefs, a chastened joy, a manly seriousness, which becomes the servant of God.

BUT is this, it may perhaps be said, 
the whole amount of that boasted fatiffation which religion beftows? Is this all the compensation which it makes, soS -those sacrifices it exacs ? Are not the terms which vice holds out, far more enticing, when it permits us to gratify every desire; and, in return for our furmounting the timorous scruples of conscience, promises us a life of gaiety, feftivity, and unrefraiaed joy ?----Such.
promises, vice may indeed make; but, how far it fulfils thems we may safely refer to the determination of the greatest sensualist, when he has finifled his career, and looks back on what he has en-*
joyed. Ask him, Whether he would recommend to his children, and his friends, . to hold the fame course; and whether, with his dying breath, he dare afflre them,. that the gratifications of lieritl.,- - oufnefs afford the greatest enjoyrnent of life'?. Whatever hopes vice mayat the beginnihg inspire, yet, after the trial Is made, it has been always found, tlat ,criminal pleafures' ate the' bane of happihenefs; the poison, not the cordial, of 'or 'pr6fent tate. They are pleasures, com-penfated riby 'an infinite overbalance pain.; Imoments of delight, succeeded bt years of, regret; purchased at the expece of injureed reputatioln, broken health, ano ruined peace. Even abstracting 'ronT their pernicious consequences, they are)
for most part, in themselves treacherous pleasures; urifound and diflurbed in the moments of enjoyment. In the midji offuch 'laughter, the heart isforrowful. 'Often is the smile of gaiety assumed, while the heart akes 'within: And though folly may taugIi, guilt will fling. Correcting this pernicious phrenzy of pleasure, and reducing it to a more sober and regulated slate, religioh is, in truth, no other than wisdom, introducing peace and order into the life of man."
"While religion condemns such plea- "
"Cures as are immoral, it is chargeable with no improper auflerity, in refpeat of those which are of an innocent kindT Think. not, that by the cautious difcipline which it prescribes, it excludes you from all gay enjoyment of life. Within the compass of that sedate spirit, to which it forms you, all that is innocently plea will be found to lie. It is a mistake to imagine, that, in constant esfusions of giddy mirth, or in that flutter of spirits which is excited by a round of diversions, the chief enjoyment of our slate consists. Were this the cafe, the vain and the frivolous would be on better terms for happiness, than the wife, the great, and the good. To arrange the plans of amusement, or to preside in the haunts of jollity, would be more defirable, than to exert the highest effort of mental powers for the benefit of na."
"tions. A consequence so absurd, is fufficient to explode the principle from which It flows. To the amusements and lesser  joys of the world, religion assigns their . proper place. It admits of them, ag iel laxations from care, as infiruments uof promoting the union of men, and of 61 livening their social intercourse. But though, as long as they are kept ithfitf due bounds, it does not censure nor cjndemn them; neither does it propose them, as rewards to the virtuous, or as the hflneipal objeas of their pursuit. To fitch, it points out nobler ends of a6ion. Thei felicity it engages them to seek, ini discharge of an useful, an upright, an&"
"honourable part in life; and, as the ha4 bitual tenour of their mind, it promotes cheerfulness, and discourages levity."

Passions, which had not been thoroughly subdued, struggle for their accustomed gratification. The pleasure which he expeAed to find in devotion, sometimes fails him; and the injustice of the world often fours and frets him. Friends prove ungrateful; enemies misrepresent, rivals supplant him; And part, at least, of the mortifications which he fuffers, he begins to ascribe to Virtue.-- Is this all the reward of my serving God, and renouncing the pleasures of fin ? Verily, in vain I have cleanjed my heart, and waJhed my hands in innocency. Behold, the ungodly prosper in the world, and have more than heart can wi/ ; while, all the day long, Jam plagued and chafned every morning.- -
To fueh persons as there, and to all who arp in hazard of being infeted with the*i fa  spirit, I now address myself. In reply to their complaints, I purpose to show, That in no slate they can choose on earth, ly no plan of condua they can form, it is possible for them to escape uneasiness and disappointment; that in a life of virtue, they will fuffer less uneasiness, and fewer disappointments, than in a course of vice;.
they will possess much higher resources and advantages; and they will. assured of cqmplete reward at the end. From these considerations, I hope to make it appear, that there is no fufficient reason.
for our being weary in well-doing; and that, taking human life upon the whole, Virtue is far the most eligible portion of I. UNEASINESS and disappointment are inseparable, in some degree, from every slate on earth, Were it in the power of the world, to render those who attach themselves to it, satisfied and lappy, you mnight then, I admit, have some title 
complain, if you found yourselves placed upon worse terms in the service of God. SE  But this is so far from being the cafe, _ that among the multitudes who devote'
themselves to earthly pleasure, you will'
not find a single person who has completely attained his aim. Enquire into the condition of the high and the low, of the gay and the serious, of the men of business and the men of. pleasure, and you thall behold them all occupied, in supplying some want, or in removing some diffrefs. No man is' pleased with'
being precisely what he is. Every-where.
there is a void; generally, even in the most prosperous life, there is some corner poffeffed by sorrow. He who is engaged in business, pines for leisure. He who enjoys leisure, languishes for want of employment. In a single, state, we envy the comforts of a family. In conjugal life, we are chagrined with domestic cares. In a safe flation, we regret the want of objetas for enterprise. In an enterprising life, we lament the want of f4fety. It is the doom of man, that his SER i  fly should never be free from all clouds, ^ 3 He is, at present, in an exiled and falUer slate. The. objeCs which surround, hwbin are beneath his native dignity. God.asa tinged them all with vanity, o4 purpofr to make him feel, that this is not hit reft that here he is not in his propetr place, nor arrived at his true home. I If, thlerefore, you aim at.'a condition'

'which. hall be exempted from every dii quiet, you pursue a phantom; yon increase the vanity and vexation of life,, by engaging in a chace so fruitless. If' yoti complain of virtue, because there is ina cident to it a portion of that uneafinefi which is found in every other state, yotie complaint is most unreasonable. You claim an immunity from evil, which belongs not to the lot of man. Recon-.
cile yourselves, then, to your condition i and, instead of looking for perfet 'hap-.

  THOUGH no condition of human life is, free from uneafdnefs, I contend, 
Thattlhe uneasiness belonging, to a sinful course, is far greater, than what attends a tdurfe of well-doing. If you be 'weary of the labdurs of virtue, be assured, that the world, whenever you try the ex*
change, will lay upon you a much heavier load. It is the outside, only, of a licentious life, which is gay and smiling.
Within, it conceals toil, and trouble, and deadly sorrow. For vice poisons human happiness in the spring, by introducing difbrdec into the heart. Those passions which it seems to indulge, it only feeds with, imperfec gratifications; and there.
by strengthens them for preying, in the endi on their unhappy victims'

It is a great mistake to imagine, that the pain of felf-denial is edhfined to virtue.
He who folltows the world, as much as he Whc follows Christ, must take up Kir icrqs and to- him, assuredly, it will prove a ore oppressive burden. Vice allows all our pallions to range uncon

No tnortifications' which 'virtue 'eexaas, ar4 mre 'fevere than thdfe, which ambitioa imposes upon the love of ease, pride upqn iatereft, and covetousness ! upon vanity, Selfi-dpial, therefore, -belongs, in come; moi, to. vice--and virtue; but with this remarkable difference, that the passions which virtue requires us -to mortify, it tends to weakren; whereas, 'thofe which vice obliges us to dehy',: it, at the fame time, strengthens. The one diminiihes the pain of felf-denial, by moderating the idemand of passion; the other increases it, . by' rendering those demands imperious and. violent.-What diffreffes, hbat oqcur in the Calm life of virtue, caa he compared tothofe tortures, which .re, ajorfe of conscience inflias on the wicked; to those -severe humiliations, arising from gilt cpmbined ,with misfortunes, which iak -.thiem to the dust; to those, iolgt agitations of shame and disappointment, which sometimes drive them to the mofR   .fatal extremities, and make them abhor their existence ? How,often, in the midst of thofl disastrous situations, into which their crimes have brought them, have they cursed the fedutions of vice; and, with bitter regret, looked back to the day on which they first forsook the path of innocence !

But; perhaps, you imagiqi, that to foch miseries as these, great, criminals only are exposed; and that,'by a wary and cautious management, it is possible to avoid them. Take vice and virtue, then, i& the -most general point of view.
Compare God and the world as two maf*
tet-, the one or other of whom you must obey; and cdnfider fairlyp in whose ferL vice there will be reafon for your being weary soonest, and .repenting moif frequently. The world is both a hard, and a capricious master. To fubmii to a long servitude, in the view of a recompense from which they are excluded in the end, "
"3 is known to be often the fate of those ,--- fwho are devoted to the world. They sacrifice their present ease, to their future profpedts. They court the great, and flatter the multitude. They prostitute their conscience, and difhofnour their charaater : And, aftet all their efforts, how uncertain is their fuceefs Competitors justle, and outstrip them. The more artful deceive, the more violent overthrow them. Fair profpefts orrce fmiiled; but clouds fooft gather; the sky is darkened; the scene changes; and that fickle world, whkch, a morent before, had flattered, the next momeiat, forgets them, "
"God is never mistaken in the charader of his servants ; for hefeeth their hearts, and jzdgeth aecording to the truth, But the world is often deceived in those who court its favour;. and, of course, is un*"
"just in the distribution of its rewards."
"Flattery gains the ear of power. Fraud supplants innocence and the pretending, and assuming, occupy the place of the worthy and the modest. In vain yot Flaim any inerit withl the world, on ac- ER "
"count of your good intentions. The - -"
"world knows them not; regards them .not. It judges of you, solely by yout acions; and, what is worse, by the suecess of your aaions, which often depends ,not on yourselves.

"The well-meant endeavours of the poor, find the fame acceptance with him, as the generous acions of the rich. The widow mite, is, in his eye, a costly offering; and even he who giveth to a difciple 4 cup of cold water, when he can give him no more, goeth not without his -reward."
"As the world is unjust in its judgments, "
"'so it is ungrateful in its requitals. Time speedily effaces the memory of the greateft services; and when we can repeat them no more, we are negleaed, and thrown aside.

"' he would not have cast me off in ny Al iold age. Unfaithfulnefs, and ingratitude, are unknown to God.

"How unjust are they, who become weary so much sooner in the service of God, than they do in that of the most severe and imperious of all maflers '"
"III. THE resources of virtue are mucl greater than those of the world; the compenfations which it makes for our diftrefles, far more valuable. Perpetual success belongs neither to the one, nor the other."
"But under disappointments, when they occur, virtue bears us up; the world allows us to fink. When the mind of a good man is hurt by misfortunes, religion adminiffers the cordial, and infuses the balm. Whereas the world inflids wounds, and then leaves them to fester."
"It brings sorrows, but it provides no confolation. Consolation is entirely the province of religion. Supposing religion to be inferiour to vice in external advantages, it must be allowed to possess internal peace, in a much higher degree. This is so certain, that almost all men, at some period or other of their life, look forward to it, as to a desirable retreat. When the ends of their present pursuit shall be accomplished, they propose to themselves much fatisfaaion, in an honourable difcharge of the duties of their flation, amidst those moderate passions, and temperate pleasures, which innocence allows."
"That which all men agree in holding to be second in importance to the pursuit which they folow, may be safely esteemed to be the first in real worth; and it - may be concluded, that if they were not blinded by forne prevailing passion, they would discern and adopt it as such."
"It is the peculiar effet of virtue, tp make a man chief happiness arise from himself and his own conduc. A bad man is wholly the creature of the world."
"He hangs upon its favour, lives by its smiles, and is happy or miserable, in proportion to his success. But to a virtuous man, success in worldly undertakings is but a secondary objea. To diicharge his own part with integrity and honourý is his chief aim. If he has done properly what was incumbent on him to do, his mind is at reft; to Providence he leaves the event. His witness is in heaven, and his record is on high. Satisfied with the approbation of God, and the testimony of a good conscience, he enjoys himself, .and despises the triumphs of guilt. In proportion as such manly principles rule your heart, you will become independent of the world; and will forbear complain of its difcouragements. It is the imperfeaion of your virtue, which occasions '--'"
"you to be weary in well-doing. It is because your hearts remain divided between God and the world, that you are so often discontented; partly wishing to discharge your duty, and partly seeking your happiness from somewhat that is repugnant to your duty. Study to be more consistent in principle, and more uniform in pratice, and your peace will be more unbroken."
"Though virtue may appear at first fight to contrat the bounds of enjoyment, you will find, upon reflecion, that, in truth, it enlarges them. If it restrains the excess of some pleasures, it favours and increases others. It precludes you from none, but such as are either fantaflick and imaginary, or pernicious and deftrucive."
"Whatever is truly valuable in human enjoyment, it allows to a good man, no less than to others. It not only allows him such pleasures, but heightens them, by that grateful relish which a good conscience gives to every pleasure. It nQt . only heightens them, but adds to them, "
"'-*A-' also, the peculiar fatisfadions which flow from virtuous sentiments, from devout affedions, and religious hopes. On how much worse terms is the finner placed, in the midst of his boasted gratifications?"
"His portion is confined to this w6rld."
"His good things are all of one fort only; She has neither knowledge, nor relish, of any thing beyond them. His enjoyment, therefore, refls on a much narrower basis, than that of the servants of God. Enlarge, as much as you please, the circle of worldly gratifications; yet, if nothing of the mind and the heart, nothing of a refined and moral nature, enter into that circle, and vary the enjoyment, languor and weariness soon succeed. Among whom do you hear more peevish expreffions of discontent, or more frequent complaints of low spirits, than among the prosessed votaries of worldly pleasure ?"
"Vice and virtue, in their progress, as in every other refpet, hold an opposite 'courfe. The beginnings of vice are en "
"ticing. The firft' feps of worldly  "
"Ivancement, are flattering and pleasing."
"But the continuance of fucceft blunts enjoyment, and flattens desire. Whereas the beginnings of virtue are laborious."
"'But, by perseverance, its labours diminiihb and its pleasures increase. As it ripeps into confirmed habit, it becomes both smoother in praaice, and more complete in its reward. In a worldly life, the termination of our hopes always meets our view. We fee a boundary before us, beyond which we cannot reach."
"But the profpeas of virtue are growing, and endless. The righteous Jhall hold on in his way; and he that hath clean hands, Jhall wax fronger and fronger. The path of the jizf is as the hining light, that Jhineth more and more unto the perfel7 day."
"This brings me to confider, "
"IV. THE assured hope, which good men enjoy, of a full reward at last. I hlave endeavoured, by several confiderations, to corret your impatience under  the. present difcouragements of virtue."
"XV, 6 -- I have shown many high advantages, "
"which it already poffeffes, But now, laying all these aside; supposing virtue to have brought you no advantage, but to have only engaged you in perpetual firuggles' with an evil world; the Text suggests what is fufficient to answer every objeCion, and to silence every complaint; In due season you fJJall reap, if you faint not. It is not a loose encouragement, or a dubious hope, which is held forth to us. A dire and explicit declaration is made by the Spirit of God, that piety and virtue, how discouraged soever, or oppressed, they may be for a while, shall not be frustrated of their reward'; but that in due season, when the period which is fixed by the Divine decree shall come, all who have not been weary in .well-doing, though they may havefown in tears,fhall reap injoy. As this great principle of faith is so essential to our present argument, and is indeed the foundation of all religion, will be proper that we aow take a view of the grounds on which it rests. By fixing our attention, both on the proofs which reason suggests, and on the discoveries which revelation has made, of a state of future retribution, we ihall take an effectual method of confirming our adherence to religion, and of baffling those temptations which might lead us to be weary in well-doing."
"T HE first, and most obvious prefump  which reason affords in behalf of future rewards to the righteous, arises from the imperfe& distribution of good and evil in our present state. Notwithtfanding what I have advanced concerning the pleasures and advantages of virtue, it cannot be denied, that the happiness of good men is often left incomplete."
"The vicious possess advantages, to which they have no right; while the confcientious fuffer for the fake of virtue, and groan under distresses which they have not merited from the world. Indeed, were the distribution of good and evil, in this life, altogether promiscuous; could --- it'be said, with truth, that thea moral condition of men had no influence whatever upon their happiness or misery I -admit, that from such a state of things, ano presumption would arise, of any future retribution being intended. . They who delight to aggravate the miseries of life, and the distresses of virtue, do no service to the argument in behalf of .
vidence. For, if total disorder be found to prevail now, suspicions may, too juftr ly, arise, of its prevailing for ever. If he who rules the universe, entirely ne, gleds virtue here, the probability must be small, of his rewarding it hereafter.
But this is far from being the true Rfate of the fa&. What human life presents to the view of an impartial observer, is by no means a scene of entire confusion; but a itate of order, begun, and carried on a certain length. Virtue is so far from being negleaed by the Governour of the world, that from many evident marks, it appears to be a chief objea of his care. In the conflitution of human nature, a foundation is laid, for comfort to the righteous, and for internal punishmeent to the wicked. Throughout the course of Divine government, tenden-ies towards the happiness of the one, and the misery of the other, conflantly appear. They are so conspicuous, as not to have escaped the notice of the rudest nations. -Over the whole earth, they have diffufed the belief, that Providence is propitious to virtue, and adverse to guilt. Yet these tendencies are, sometimes, disappointed of their effea; and that which Providence visibly favours, is left, at present% without an adequate re,ward.

From such an imperfea difiribution of happiness, what are we to conclude, but that this system is the beginning, not the whole of things; the opening only of a more extensive plan, whole confummation reaches into a future world ? If God has already et his throne for judgment; if he has visibly begun to reward and to . punish, in some degree, on earth, he canU-  not mean to leave the exercise of govern ment incomplete. Having laid the foundation of a great and noble ftruCiure, he will in due time rear it up to perfeaion.
The unfinished parts of the fabric evidently show, that a future building is intended. All his other works are conftruded according to the most full and exaa proportion. In the natural world, nothing is deficient, nothing redundant.
It is in the moral world, only, that we discover irregularity and defea. It falls short of that order and perfeaion, which appear in the reft of the creation. It exhibits not, in its present slate, the fame features of complete wisdom, justice, or goodness. But can we believe, that, under the government of the Supreme Being, those apparent disorders shall not be redified at the last ? Or, that from his conduct towards his rational creatures, the chief of his works, the sole objedcion against his perfecion ihall be allowed to rife, and ihall continue unremoved for ever.

On the supposition of future rewards xvM.

and 'punifhments, a satisfying account can b6 given, of all the disorders which at present take place on earth. Chriftianity explains their origin, and traces them to their iffle. Man, fallen from his primeval felicity, is now undergoing probation and discipline for his final date. Divine juflice remains, for a season, concealed; and allows men to at their parts with freedom on this theatre, that their charaaers may be formed and ascertained. Amidst difcouragements and afflitions, the righteous give proof of their fidelity, and acquire the habits of virtue. But, if you suppose the events of this life to have no reference to another, the whole slate of man becomes, not only inexplicable, but contradiatory, and inconsistent. The powers of the inferiour animals are perfedtly suited to their station. They know nothing higher than their present condition. In gratifying their appetites, they fulfill their deftityY-and pass away. Man, alone, comes SE  forth to at a part, which carries no  Smeaning, and tends to no end. Endowed with capacities, which extend far beyood his present Iphere; fitted by his ratioprn nature, for running the race of immorz tality, he is flopped short in the very en(
trance of his course. He squanders his activity on pursuits, which he discerns to be vain. He languishes for knowledge, which is placed beyond his reach. Hd thirts after a happiness, which heo is doomed never to enjoy. He fees, and laments, the disasters of his state; and yet, upon this supposition, can find nothing to remedy- them.-Has the eternal God any pleasure in sporting himself with such a scene of misery and folly, as this life, if it had no connetion with another, muff exhibit to his eye? Did he call into exiflence this magnificent uni*
verse, adorn it with so much beauty and splendour, and surround it with those glorious luminaries which we behold irn the heavens, only that some generations of mortal men might arise to behold these wonders, and then disappear for eve ti ME How unsuitable, in this cafe, were thd '
habitation to the wretched inhabitant!
How inconsistent the commencement of his -being, and the mighty preparation of his powers and faculties, with his defpieable end How contraditory, in fine, were every thing which concerns the slate of man, to, the wisdom and perfetion of hid Maker!

'Throughout all ages, and among all nations, the persuasion of a future life has prevailed. It sprung not from the refinements of science, or the speculations of philosophy; but from a deeper and stronger root, the natural sentiments of the human heart. Hence it is common to the philosopher and the savage; and is found in the most barbarous, as well as in the most civilized regions. Even the belief of the being of a God, is not more general on the earth, than the belief of immortality. Dark, indeed, and confitfed, were the notions which men entertained concerning a future state.

Yet itill, in ,that state, they looked for  retribution, both to the good, and the bad; and in the perfetion of such pleafures, as they knew best, and valued most highly, they placed the rewards of the virtuous. So universal a consent feems.plain*
ly to indicate, an original determination given to the foul by its Creator. It shows this great truth, to be native and congenial to man.

When we look into our own breasts, 
we find various anticipations and presages of future existence. Most of our great and high passions, extend beyond the limits of. this life. The ambitious and the felf-denied, the great, the good, and the wicked, all take interest, in what is to happen after they ihall have left the earth. That passion for fame, which inspires so much of the ativity of mankind, plainly is animated by the perfuasion, that consciousness is to survive the dissolution of the body. The virtuous are supported by the hope, the guilty tormented with the dread, of what is to alce place Atter death. As death Approaches, 


the hopes 6f the one, arid the fears of the other, are found to redouble. The foul$
when issuing henee feertms more clearly t6 diifern its future abode, All the operationd of eonfcietite, proceed upon the belief of inim ortality. The whole moral condua of ineh refers to it. All legislators have supposed it. All religions are built upon it.
It is so essential to the order of society, that were it erased, human laws would pro ineffe&ual' eftraints from evil, and a deluge of brimes arid miseries wpuid overflovt the earth. To suppose this universal and powerful belief to be without foundation in truth, iý to suppose, that a principle of delusion wA interwoven .ith the nature of man ; is .td suppose, that his Creator was teduced ;to ;the necessity of imprefling his heart with a falsehood, inr order to make him answer the ptrpofes of his being.

1UT though these arguments be firong,.

yet all argtments are liable to objedion.
Perhaps this general belief, of which I have spoken, has been owing to inclination and . desire, more than to evidence. Perhaps, in pur reasonings on this fubjet from the Divine perfedions, we flatter ourselves with being of more consequence, than we truly are, in the fyfiem of the universe. Hence the great importance of a discovery pr6ceeding from God himself, which gives full authority to all that reason had suggested, and places this capital truth beyond the'
reach of suspicion or distrust.

The method which Christianity has ta ken, to convey to us the evidence of a future slate, highly deserves our attention. Had the Gospel been addressed, like a system of philosophy, solely to the underflanding of men; had it aimed only at enlightening the fludious and refle  it would have confined itself to abftra& truth; it would have simply informed us, that the righteous are hereafter to be rewarded, and sinners to be punished. Such a declaration as that contained in the Text, would have been fufficient: Be not weary in well-doing; for in due season you hall reap, if you faint not. 


But the Gospel has not flopped, at barely announcing life and immortality to mankind. It was calculated for popular edification. It was intended to be the religion not merely of the few, whose underflanding was to be informed ; but of the many, also, whose imagination was to be impressed, and whose paflions were to be awakened, in order to give the truth its due influence over them. Upon this account it not only reveals the certainty of a future slate, but, in the person of the great Founder of our religion, exhibits a series of fads relating to it; by means of which, our senses, our imagination, and passions, all become interested in this great objet.

The refurreaion of Chrifi from the grave, 
was designed to be a sensible evidence, that death infers not a final extinction of the living principle. He rose, in order to show, that, in our name, he had conquered death, and was become the irftfruits of them that sleep. Nor did he only rife from the grave, but, by ascending to heaven in a visible form, before Tmany witnesses, gave an ocq 16-ý lar specimen of the transition from this world, into the region of the blessed. The employments which now occupy him there, are fully declared. As our fore-runner, he hath entered within the veil. He appears in the presence of God for us. ,He maketh perpetual interce/ion for bis people. I go, faith he,' to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God. In my Father house are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself that where I am, there ye may be ao4o. The circumstances of his coming again, are diflindly foretold. The founding of the last trumpet, the refurreaion of the dead, the appearance of the Judge, and the solemnity with which he shall difcriminate the good from the bad, are all described.
The very words in which he shall pronounce the final sentence, are recited in our hearing: Come, ye blefed of my Father!
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Then shall the holy and the just be caught up in the tlouds, to meet the Lord in the air. They $  shall enter with him into the city of the   God. They shall possess the new earth and new heavens, wherein dwelleth righteoufnefs. God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. They Jhall behold his face in righteousness, and be satisfied with hit likeness for ever.-By recording such a train of striking circumstances and fads, the Gof, pel familiarizes us in some measure with a future state. By accommodating this great discovery, in so useful a manner, to the conceptions of men, it furnishes a strong intrinsic evidence of its divine origin.

THUS, upon the whole, whether you consult your reason, or listen to the discoveries of revelation, you behold our argument confirmed; you behold a life of piety and virtue, issuing in immortal felicity, Of what worldly pursuit can it be pronounced, that its reward is certain? Look every where around you, and you shall fee, that the race is far from being always to the swift, or the battle to the fjrong. The  most diligent, the most wife, the most ao,   complifhed, may, after all their labouis, be disappointed in the end; and be left to susser the regret, of havingfpent their lrengtb for nought. But, for the righteous, is laid up the crown of life. Their final happiness is prepared in the eternal plan of Providence, and secured by the labours and susferings of the Saviour of the world.

Cease, then, from your unjust complaints against virtue and religion. Leave difcon, tent, and peevishness, to worldly men. In no period of distress, in no moment of difappointment, allow yourselves to fufpet, thaý piety and integrity are fruitless. In every slate of being, they lead to happiness.
If you enjoy not at present their full rewards, it is because the season of recompence is not yet come. For, in due season you fhallrepp.
There is a time which is proper for reward; and there is a period which belongs to trial.
How long the one should last, and when the other should arrive, belongs not to you tp determine. It is fixed by the wife, though unknown, decree of the Almighty.

But, be assured, that He that cometh, shall come, and will not tarry. He shall come in '
due season, to reRore perse& order among his works; to bring reft to the weary, comfort to the afflided, and just retribution to all men. Behold, faith the faithful and true Witness, I come quickly, and my reward is with me. To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midfl of the paradise of God. I will give him the morning far. I will make him a pillar in my temple. HeJhall be cloathed in white raiment; and shall it down with me, on my throne*.
