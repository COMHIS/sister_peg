"A SERMON ON THE DEATH OF SIR DAVID DALRYMPLE "
"KING Solomon, like other wife men, of whom he was the chief, sometimes communicates truth in paradoxes, to raise attention, and excite enquiry. The direct contrary of those sayings, at first fight, appears to be true, but a close examination brings round the mind to yield its firmest assent. A good name, fays he, verse i., is better than precious ointment, and the eday of A death death than the day of one birth.  2. It is better to, go to the hoife of mourning, than to the hoife offefting, for that is the end of a!/ men, and the living will lay it to his heart."
"In confirmation of which last he adds, in the words of my text, Sorrow is better than tllaghter, fr by the fadntefr of the countenance the heart is made better. As if he had said, "
"IT is true, and you may be assured of it, "
"however incredible it may appear, That the grave and serious difpofiti6n of the house of mourning, the compafion and grief, which arise on the folamn occasions of performing the last offices of humanity to our friends and brethren, is far preferable, on many accounts, to the gay and frolicsome temper of the house of feasting, to that mirth and laughter which is excited in feflive aflemblies; and those serious occasions ought especially to be fought after, and a correfponding disposition cultivated by us mortals, who are in a slate of preparation for another world, because they have a happy influence in mending the heart."
"THE IN our journey through this life, we mufl tot be so much amused with the entertainments of it, as to lose fight of the heavenly Jerusalem, whither we are going. And to assure to ourselves a mansion in that blessed abode, the proper method is, not so much to please our fancies, as to improve our hearts in virtue. For this purpose, ease and fePcivity are not experienced to be friendly, but seasons of afflicion have been found by the wife to have a salutary efficd. It shall be the aim of this discourse, to impress you with a sense of the necessity of sometimes encouraging a serious and recollected temper of mind, and to reconcile you to those fad and mournful scenes, that are moll likely to produce such dispositions."
"WITH this view, all I propose to do, "
"under divine assistance, is to set forth, in some instances, the chief excellence of forrow, or the sadness of the countenance, That by it the heart is made better. In the FIRST ( 6 )"
"FIRST place, then, By sorrow and the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better, because it is of great use to mortify our pride."
"Tbo' pride was not made for man, whose foundation is in the duif, and whose gloy, is but like the flower of the grass, yet doth he often exalt hinflEf agaijl the Moji High God, and fay with dreadful infoience of heart, what is the Almighty that I fiould serve him; and what profit hall I have I pray unto him ?"
"Thus departeth he from God, aud his heart is turned from the Lord his Maker, by that pride which is hateful to God and Man, and which is the beginning offin, ECCL.  iS. and "
"13. And what disease of the mind, what moral illness can be a greater obftacie to our lalvation and happiness, what more dangerous to the life of our fouls? For it is the very nature of this disorder to rejeEt all ofsered assistance, to despise and resist all propofals and attempts towards a cure."
"BUT (7)"
"BUT the Almighty and kind Physician of fouls withholds not his saving help, nor ihortens his friendly arm, though we are froward, and think ourselves whole. For he deals around the humbling strokes of his Providence, to raise in us that fadcs es fthe counteiance, by ' wicb ibe eart i' made better."
"He casts the neceftary portion of sorrow into the cfale, to counterbalance that immoderate elation of the heart, which is the nourifher of pride."
"Now sorrow is a felf-annihilating passion, "
"that dwells upon the weakness and vanity of our condition, and sets before us, in the moit striking light, every circumstance that can render us mean and contemptible in our own eyes. It brings down every vain thought and high imagination, presents us with the mortifying profped of all our boafled endowments and possessions laid in the dust, and reduces the mind to such a low and desolate tfate, that then, if ever, it will have recourse to its first principles of trodt in the Lord Jebovah it will bring to remembrance the ( 8 )"
"the Man offorrows, whop was meek and lowz ly of heart, and revive that sense of present Deity, which alone can give it relief."
"AND what, my brethren, can more effec-."
"tually humble the pride of human nature than a serious attention to the objets of forrow ? What is there so well suited to produce in us that fecf-abafement, he which who poffejes not JJall never be exalted ?"
"To behold the pride of riches brought down to the level of the grave ! allthe pomp and magnificence of life conclude in the diimal solemnity of a funeral ! To fee the renowned hero, for whose valour and activity, this spacious globe was but a scanty theatre, circumscribed within the narrow limits of a coffin and a tomb ! To observe the tongue of the wife and learned, that swayed the multitude to all his designs, become mute and silenced forever ! To behold man, the lordlieft creature in this world, in all the unforefeeing haughtiness of youth perhaps, brought down down in a few hours to the humble bed of sickness and of death: his bloom of beauty changed into ghastly paleness; the glory of his strength turned into infant weakness ; helpless, forlorn, and agonized, beyond the reach of power or of riches, of art or of science, to relieve or detain for one moment ! These are fad and mournful scenes ! To make us athamed of our pride! Surely these are scenes of sorrow, by which the heart is made better ! Again, "
"SECONDLY, By sorrow, and the sadness of the countenance-the heart is made better, because it lefrens our attachment to the world, and the things of the world."
"As ridiculous as it appears, for an immor talfoul to labour for the nzeat which peri /eth;"
"to waite its noble faculties in making provision for the JflJ, and in laying  treafJres upon earth, since these things can never satisfy the desires of a free and rational spirit, which God made for himself, and which must be restless and unhappy when it is not returning returning to him again ; as strange as this conduc may seem, yet it is undeniably true, that we are all too apt to set our affecions on the world and its enjoyments, and to place our highefi hopes, and seek our chief felicity in them; than which fond attachment, there is nothing that enters into the heart of man more opposite and hoffile to all religious improvement."
"Now sorrow has an excellent influence in leflening this vicious attachment to the world, inasmuch as it greatly abates that keen relish for outward enjoyments, which renders them so dangerous to the welfare of our fouls. Sackcloth and alhes, silence and darkness, and abstinence from whatever could delight the senses, which was the mourning of the ancient patriarchs according to the Old Testament, might sometimes indeed be pradifed then, as it may be still, in oftentation of a grief,they did not feel. But the simplicity of their manners, as well as the nature of the thing itself, leaves us no room to doubt, that it was, for the most part, a genuine effect, and expression of true and undissembled sorrow. Thus did these good men, and thus do all of us who are not greatly corrupted, in some measure, fulil the days of our mourning. For what heart has ever been deeply finitten with sorrow, that has not felt the truth of this obfervation ? In those hours of uneasiness and wo, have not all that can take too fast hold of the foul, the most pleasant gratifications of sense, and even the joys of friendship and sweet society, been rendered insipid and diftasteful!"
"THERE are certain persons, indeed, of a more refined temper of mind, and more delicate sentiments, than to admit the gross enjoyments of sense to the pofefflion of their hearts, who will notwithstanding take the world into their bosoms in a more plausible shape, and raise therein as dangerous rivals to God and religion. For theyallow it to infinuate itself into their minds,under the appearance of natural affection, fiiendfhip, or some other commendable passion, till it chain them down with those cords of love, and bands of a man, to a state of as abject slavery, as that of the greatet sensualist upon earth."
"The most beautiful affedions of our nature are not incapable of abuse and vicious excess; for he that loveth father or mother, fays Christ himself, more than me, is not ·worlby of me; and be that loveth on or dazighter more than me, is not worthy oJf  MAT."
"x. 39."
"IN this cafe, the heart-improving effe&"
"of sorrow, must be evident to all: For the Great Governor of the world chaflifes his creatures with the kindness of a father, when he fends his messinger, Death, for those darlings of their hearts, and throws down those idol gods that profane his most sacred temple. Thus rebukes he at once their forgetfulness of him, and removes the cause of it;"
"awakens them into a sense of their duty, and clears away the impediments to the performance of it; and snatches from them those dear objects that engage all their love and attention, that they may perceive and acknowledge acknowledge that sovereign and bountiful hand which gives them ail things richly to enjoy. Nor can it be doubted, that such is truly the effed of a deep-felt sorrow; for when can the mind be more sensible of the vanity of all earthly pofleffions, when is it more likely to perceive the folly of violent attachments to frail and mortal men, than in those days of fad reflecion, when the death of a dear relation, or beloved friend, has difsolved as it were the charm that made this world delightful, broke the chain that tied it to sublunary things, and destroyed all its imaginary schemes of happiness?"
"BUT, besides the grief which arises on those interesting occasions, what can more discredit the goods of fortune, and all outward things, than a serious attention to the general objects of sorrow ? For what does outward good avail against disease or death ?"
"Can the pofleffion of all the enjoyments of sense, through a long and prosperous life, afluage the pains of a bed of sickness ? And if they cannot relieve the body, how much leis less influence must they have to - sooth the anguith of the mind? Can they heal a wounded spirit, or Jfop the gnawings of the worm that dieth not ? Can they draw a veil over the terrors of the future world,that come awfully near in that dreadful extremity?"
"No surely. Something else muff attend the death of the righteous; Something more fpiritual muff prepare a foul for the other world, and enable it to enter with confidence and joy into the presence of the Great Creator. Thus the discovery of their uselessness to man in his greatest necessity, must lessen our attachment to the world, and the things of the world."
"AGAIN,in the THIRD place, another heart improving effeEc offorrow and thefadnefi of the countenance, is, that thereby tender and charitable dispositions are strengthened and cultivated in our minds."
"THE temper of the hortfe of feaJling, that levity of mind which accompanies immoderate indulgence in outward pleasure, has a most most unhappy tendency to fifle the sentiments of humanity, and to render us insenfible to the wants and calamities of our brethren. Attention to the distress of others is painful to us in that state, because it interrupts, and in some measure upbraids our joy; and therefore, hardening our hearts, we dismiss it as soon as we can. Thus do voluptuous men flop their ears at the cries of the poor, and turn away their eyes from beholding piteous objets; flattering their consciences perhaps with the false excuse of Behold we knew it not; and forgetting that he who pondereth the heart doth coniider it, and will render to every man according to his works. PRov. xxiv. I , 12."
"Now sorrow is undoubtedly a very pro per cure for this disease of the mind; for it softens the heart to an extreme degree of sensibility, and raises in it all those kind, gentle, and compassionate dispositions, that are so nearly akin to itself, so deeply rooted in our nature, and so useful ahd ornamental to human life. This all good men have ac knowledged khcewledged to be one of the greatest and most certain effeds of sorrow and afflicion;"
"and for this cause our blessed Saviour himself was in all things made like unto his brethren, fubjefed to the wants, the pains and griefs of human nature; that being touched with the feeling of our infirmities, he might be a merciful andfaithfil Hi-gh PrieJ/. But this effed of sorrow is so obvious, that it needs no further illustration, and therefore I proceed to the FOURTH instance, "
"AND it is the LAST I shall mention;"
"wherein by fArrow and the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better, that is, That we are thereby roused to a sense of our own mortality, and excited to prepare for death."
"As much as all we fee around us, and every day experience concur to the proof of man mortality; although we cannot fail to perceive the frailty of our nature, and to feel the feedsof death ihooting forth in a thousand various diseases in there frail bodies of of ours, yet so much are we engaged in the pursuits of this world, that we seldom betlow on that awful event, the serious consideration it undoubtedly deserves, but hastily dismiss it from our thoughts, when it presumes to enter there, and chace it as far as possible from our relutant fight, "
"IT is therefore one of the greatest spirit ual advantages of sorrow and the sadness of the countenance, that it awakens men out of that fatal unconcern, and gives them the loudest alarm to prepare for an hereafter."
"And indeed when our pride is mortified, our love of the world subdued, and every humane and tender affedion kindled in our breafts,-then, if ever, will we be in a favourable disposition, to attend to the circumftances and condition of our nature, to confider our latter end, and the measure of our days, and to know howfrail we are."
"THIS is the reason why the wife Solomon prefers the house of mourning to the honfe of feafling, because it is the end of ll men, and the the living will lay it to his heart. And who that i snot-more insensible than things inanimate, can remain unmoved on those interefting occasions ? Who can fee his dearest acquaintance and friends ly down in the dust, not to rife again till the heavens be no more, and to have no portion forevec in any thing that is done under the fin; Who can behold this end of all men without laying it to his bxart ? without deeply revolving in his mind, That he also must soon go to his long home, that he also must be involved in that universal calamity, which cometh alike unto all ?"
"AND if we are fully impressed with the sense, and duly affcted with the importance of death, that will surely stir us up to prepare for it. Can we behold the dreadful despair of such as are without hope in their death; can we be witnefles to their forlorh and defoiate condition, who have lived without virtue, without religion, without God in the world, and not take warning to fliun the rock on which they made ]jipwreck of their theirfalvation ? And,onthe otherhand can we behold the dying tranquillity of those who have made their peace with God, who have coifciences void of offence towards ( od ard towards men; Can we be fpedators of the faith, the hope, the joy, with which they enteron a new state of being, and not be excitedby that noble example, to live the ive of the righteous, that we may alo die like him .?"
"THUS have I endeavoured to illustrate the truth of the wife man observation in our."
"Text, That sorrow is better than laughter, for by thefadnefs of the countenance the heart is made better. And according to this maxim it will be our wisdom, and our interest to regulate our conduc."
"BUT let us not imagine, that this doctrine obliges us to bear down our disposition to innocent mirth, which is a part of our nature, orto abstain from all amufemnents or recreations, as if they were altogether inconfiftent with the gravity and recollecion of a Christian. Our religion enjoins not, nor 2 does does our spiritual interest require such aufte."
"rity. All that is demanded of us, and all in."
"deed that is neceffary,is thatwe use amusements seasonably and moderately, that we love them with no greater affection, and pursue them with no more eagerness, than is proportioned to their value; and that we never allow them to interfere with duties of everlasting obligation. Add to this, that whatever is natural, is attended with some fatisfastion;"
"pity which is a mixture of love and sorrow, diffuses a kind of pleating anxiety over the mind; and grief itself is not without its tender joys. Gravity and composure, is the source of the greatest and most excellent pleasures; for the highest joy is no more exprefled by laughter, than the deepest sorrow by tears."
"LET us not, therefore, in future, addict ourselves so much to the house of feadqing, Let us not be so eagerly solicitous about mirth and pleasure, and so restless and irnpatient when we cannot procure it. Let us not encompass sea and land, to find where withal 2 ]i withal to make our hearts glad. Nor let us dread sadness and sorrow as the greatest evil that can befal us; and, in compliance with fashionable mistakes, shun the house of mourning, and lose many opportunites of exercising iome of the be ft alTetions of our nature."
"You may not unreasonably expet-, my brethren, that on this occasion, I should fay something of that most worthy person of eminence, Lord Hailles, who has so lately disappeared from among us, and been gathered to his fathers. For though our church does not encourage funeral discourses in general, because they are liable to much abuse;"
"yet would it be improper to allow those, whose distinguished talents and virtues asford a theme of inftruation to mankind, to fink down to the grave in silence, without endeavouring in the hour of sorrow, for your loss of such persons, to draw your attention to their example."
"YouR TOUR loss did I fay? and'furely if ten righteolus were enough to have saved a wicked city from deftrudion, in the days of the patriarch Abraham, we have good reason in our degenerate days, deeply to regret the loss of one person of marked and pre-eminent virtue."
"IT would not become me to enlarge on his charader as a supreme Judge in the civil and criminal courts, capacities in which he ated in the view of his country, from which he meritedand obtained high confidence and approbation; forhis knowledge of the laws was accurate and profound, and he. applied it in judgment, with the molt scrupulous integrity. In his proceedings in the criminal court, the fatisfadion he gave to the public could not be furpafed. His abhorrence of crimes, his tenderness for the criminals, his respect for the laws, and his reverential awe of the Omniscient Judge, inspired him on some occafions, with a commanding sublimity of thought, and a feeling solemnity of exprefsion, that made condemnation seem just, as the the doom of Providence to the criminals themselves, and raised a salutary horror of crimes in the breast of the audience."
"CONSCIOUS of the dignity and import."
"ance of the high office he held, he never departed from the decorum that becomes that reverend characder: which indeed it colt him no effort to support, because he aced from principle and sentiment, both in public and private. Affectionate to his family and relations, simple and mild in his manners, pure and conscientious in his morals, enlightened and entertaining in his conversation; he left society only to regret, that, devoted as he was to more important employments, he had so little time to spare for intercourse with them."
"WHTY should I mention to you, his exten five learning, and his exquisite taste as a scholar? Hewaswell known tobe of high rank in the republic of letters, and his loss will be deeply felt through many of her departments. His labours in illustration of the hiftorv 24 1 history of his country, and many othef works of profound erudition, remain as monuments of his accurate and faithful research for materials, and his found judgment in the feledion of them. It is of more importance to you, that I remind you of his unfeigned piety and devotion, of which you have so very often been witnefles where we now are. I must add, however, that his attendance on religious ordinances, was not merely out of refped to the laws, and for the fake of example, (motives which mhould never fail to have influence on persons of superior rank, for the most obvious reasons) but from principle and conviction, and the most conscientious regard to his duty; for he not only pradifed all the virtues and charities in proof of his faith, but he demonstrated the sincerity of his zeal, by the uncommon pains he took to illustrate primitive Christianity, and by his elaborate and able defences of it againft its enemies. Him therefore our religion itfelfhasjuft cause to lament, as a fallen bulwark of our Jerusalem ! May the King and Head of the church speedily repair her loft loss, that the gates of hell may never prevail rngainjt her !"
"THERE is another part of his character which I muff present to your view, because it has refped to the times, and because I know that you had a reverence for his worth, and a just regard for his opinions. Ill indeed can the times bear the loss of such an affecionate patriot, and able guardian of the laws of his country. But we must not mur-, mur at the will of Providence, which in its mercy, may have withdrawn the good man ,from the evil to come. In mercy I fay to him, whose righteous spirit was so deeply grieved, when he saw the wicked rage, and the people imagine a vain thing."
"His profound researches into history, and his thorough knowledge of the laws, made him perfecly acquainted with the progress of the conftitutionof Britain,froim the first dawn of liberty in the common law of the land, and the trial by jury which precede all written records, and afterwards in the origin and establishment efPablifhment of parliaments, through all its riciffitudes and dangers, till at last by the blessing of divine Providence, which brought many wonderful events to concur to the fame end, it was renewed, strengthened, and finally confirmed by the Revolution. At this blessed xra all the rights of men were defined and secured, and have ever since been sacredly preserved. Since that time, there has been no encroachment on perfonal freedom, or the security of property, on liberty of conscience or on the liberty of the press. The road to riches and preferment has been open to all men. The laws restrain us from nothing, but the power to violate the rights of.others. They have been ena with common content. They have been adminifteredwithjuftice,andhavebeen equally applied to rich and poor, to high and low."
"An exadt balance has been preserved among all the springs of the political machine; and through all the rough gales of foreign wars, and softer breezes of opposition, the vessel of state has been steered with safety and filccess. It was this goodly and venerable fabric of the British Constitution, which the deceafecl 1 27 ]"
"deceased most refpedable character contemplated with admiration and delight, (of late indeed with a mixture of anxiety and fear)"
"as the temple of piety, as the genuine source of greater happiness and freedom, to a larger portion of mankind, than ever flowed from any government upon earth. Gracious Heaven ! Why haft thou at this critical hour, deprived us of so able and zealous a friend to our afiaulted constitution ?"
"FOR, wonderful to tell, in the midftof this happy period of our history, which for a century past. has been such as cannot be parralelled, in any country under the fun, when we were reaping the happy effecs of our free and equal government in the most brilliant prosperity, when by its natural force, it had corrected some errors, and was in the train of preventing others; when the load of debts which had accrefced, by means of wars formerly begun and carried oil with the united voice of the nation, was rapidly diminifling by our late wife and fortunate .mneafures; when every man was fitting un 2 der der his own vine and his ownfig-tree, to use the language of Scripture, enjoying the fruits of his industry, and contemplating with pleasing hopes, the future glory and happiness of his country;-Lo ! ,The enemy of human happiness, who is ever watchful, to sow tares in the good man field, has most envioufly interfered, to mar so promising a harvest."
"SOME evil spirits, taking advantage of the late occurrences in a neighbouring country, whose former government, it must be obferved, was totally the opposite of ours, and of the ferment and expeEtation, that has thereby been raised in the minds of men, have endeavoured of late, by sophistry and false arguments, by misrepresentation and lies, by raising fears and hopes that are equally groundless: By traducing all the superior orders of men,by every bold and insidious art, that malice could invent, and scurrilous tongues and pens express, to subvert the minds of a peaceful and happy people, and to persuade them, that they now are and have have long been under a fad deluflon: That their condition is totally the reverse of what they have experienced it to. be; that they have no constitution of government, that they enjoy no liberty; that their equal laws, are oppressive and unjust; that though the poor man enjoys the fruits of his labour un, disturbed as he ought to do, yet the rici has no right to what has been acquired by the labour of his forefathers; and that even our mild and virtuous king, who holds histhrone no less by the love and affeteion of his subjeds, than by the law of the land,, is an Ufurper and a Tyrant."
"AND what is the purpose and design of all this false representation ? It is not, as they give out, merely to correct abuses in government, or to amend any defets that may be in the conffitution. No, no. These objects require no such violent mean for their accompliflhment. These are fubljeds of a parliamentary reform, whenever they are of moment enough to decferve its attention, and lead to no opportunity ofmifchief."
"No, their design is, though concealed from the simple and the weak among them, yet avowed by the master spirits, to excite the minds of the people to commotion, to tumult, to revolt and rebellion, that they may lay in ruins the goodly fabric of this goverment, the work of ages, the envy of all the nations of the world, which so happily unites the possession of all the rights of men, with national prosperity; and by means of which at this hour, over all the world, acitizen of Britain wherever he comes, is treated with distinguished refped, as a being of a superior order."
"WHAT, my brethren. can my feeble efforts do to flop the progress of this kindling fire could reasoning and argument avail, there is no time for it at present. All I can do now, is to warn you to take heed and "
"ware ! To beware of those lying spirits who would reduce you to your ruin. Would to God ! that I had that warning voice, which cried aloud of old, when.Satan was let loose to take revenge on men, JWoe, woe, woe,  ibe the inhabitants on earth ! Or that I could speak to you with the weight and authority of him, who so lately descended to the tomb, and now I trust enjoys the fruits of his righteousness ! Then would I beseech you, by all you hold dear, by your parents and families, by your wives and children, by your religion and liberty, by all your hopes in this world and that which is to come, to turn a deaf ear to the lying words of the reducer! What are your grievances? Did you perceive them till you were told ? Do you now feel them ? Will you not trust to your own experience, rather than to a band of dark conspirators ?"
"WHO are they? ó\nd what are their means for accomplishing their boasted designs ? Itwouldbeimproper, from this place,to give them the harhieft epithets they deserve;"
"but surely they are not the most enlightened and wife, the most liberal and disinterested, ·the most fober and industrious members of society: Not those who have either much characer or property to lose, but the difcon tented tented, the disappointed, or ambitious, who are devoid of talents to gratify their passions, unless it be in times of confusion; And what are their means for accomplishing their designs? They have none, but either a foreign force, which would at once turn the rage of every Briton against them, or following the example so lately set before them by that very foreign .enemy on whose aid they can only rely, to raise an ignorant, an unruly and desperate mob, which all great cities can furnifi, who, having nothing to lose, delight in scenes of riot and confusion;"
"and with them, as with an engine that has no ill or direction of its own, to perpetrate their wicked purposes, and through rapine, havock and blood, to overturn religion, law, and the ancient constitution, that, under pretence of a free democracy, they may acquire dominion and wealth to them-."
"'selves."
"BUT I trust in Divine Providence, that they ihall not be permitted to execute their execrable designs. I fee the wife and good, "
"the the enlightened and intelligent, the fober and industrious, the quiet and peaceable of all ranks, have taken the alarm, and are forming Leagues of defence around the constitution, that is,around religion and liberty, property and law. I fee the Genius of Britain rifing indignant, to punish her ingrateful sons, and to repel the threatened invasion of her insolent foes. May divine wisdom and fortitude preside over her counsels, that light may spring out of darkness, and order fron confusion. AMEN."
