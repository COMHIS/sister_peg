The Justice and Necefsy of the WAR wvith our AMERICAN COLONIE.S Examincd.

A SERMON, The justice and necefity of the WAvR with our AM ER IC A CoLoN ES, confidered.
Shll I yet again go out to battle againfl the children of Benjamin my brother, or Jhall I cease ? Judges xx. 28.

HESE words are taken from the hiftory of that war which the children of Israel carried on against the tribe of Benjanin, on account of an enormous a& of cruelty and injustice done to a private person of Israel, by the men of Gibeah, a town of Benjamin. Compensation for this injurywas at first demanded; but it was refuted with insolence. War ensued ; and the Israelites were defeated in two great battles, with the loss of forty thousand men. They had consulted the Lord each time they had taken the field; but, for wife reasons, only known to himself, he fought not on their fide. The children of Israel, affliced and dismayed, and affraid that their fins we A the thl fi-;-ct cifc G ! ller difo :T'.tlrc, kep-c a blc ,tn lhl unto te l.ord, ' and v(ci;t up, ' and ca;.Ce unto tile ho;ife of God, and wept, ' and there lft bLio!rc he Lord, and fafl' ed that d:.iy untiil even, and ofi'rcrl brnt o;(er'ings, and pcace-oferings c!;ifrc the L' ord.'

'I he plain concluihon from this conduC. of the !iraelitcs is, That nations must persevere with fortitude in a righteous cause, and continue to apply to God by prayer, and all thlc dutics of rLligi.n, if they hope for success in war.

On former occafolis, frr.iiar to this, when wvc have been called upon, by our present Sovereign, to address the King of Kings, for a blelling upon his counfcs and arms, it has been on account of forci';n wars, in which the safety or honour of the nation or its ailies, have necefilarily engaged us on the clearclt grounds; and there is no need of cxplaining the:l to you. The very last war was :n'Jictsken on iuch grounds; for it was Â· i n1 in dcfence of our ancient colonies, (now in arms againat thieir protectors), who were then in danger of being subdued by the enemies of the Britilh empire. You may remember with what zeal and afiedeion you espoused their cause, and what sincere and fervent prayers you repeatedly offered up to heaven in their behalf, touched with the sense of their calamities, and alarmed at their danger. How soon are things changed!
and how great the change ! Not long after the conclusion of that bloody and expensive war, in recent remembrance, while that generation still lives and flourishes which we saved from the foe, those ungrateful colonies, by their foul 'revolt, have forced us into the must unnatural and dangerous war againft themselves. And, left your minds, my brethren, should not be prepared to change as fafl as theirs, left the remains of your partial affeaion should make you fliut your eyes to thejuftice and necessity of this war, I think it incumbent on me, as a proper exercise for this day, to flhew you the grounds on which we are gone out, and ought agagn to go out a.nainlZ the children of Benjamin, Beijamini, our brother, andsJhould not cease, that your prayers for success to almighty God may be equally rational and fervent.

I shall, in the ifl place, endeavour to shew thejuftice an nciceliity of this war. And then, zdly, Point out our duty, in the present circumflances, to God and to our country.

In the ift place, I am to shew the justice and necessity of this war.

But how (hall I enter into so wide a field ?

or in what method (hall I treat such a copious subjel ? The {ketch I can now give you of it, must of necessity be ihort: And I muff trust to your previous knowledge, to fill up and fupply.my brief and imperfeet delineation.

Let us examine the grounds of this re volt, and try if we can find them in ancient right, or in recent provocation; or, if there ihould fail, let us then fee if expediency obliges, or the honour of the nation permits us, to yield to their demands.

The adventurers who first set out from Europe to the new discovered country of America, went all in search of the pre cious k S )

cious metals. Our colonists engaged in -*their enterprizes with the fame view; and, when they were disappointed, they changed their object for others more lucrative to themselves, and to the mother-country.
Discontent with the various forms of government, civil or ecclesiastical, that prevailed in their turns at home, during the last century, led many afterwards to seek for more peaceful abodes in that distant region. But, whatever were the objecs of the first settlers of our American dominions, separation from the government of Britain was none of them; for, to preserve their connection with their native land, they went all under charters granted by the sovereign of this country, with certain rights to the lands where they fettled, and with the grant of certain powers defined by the charters, and to be administered in such manner as they prescribe. As corporations, they had rights given them to make bye-laws for themselves ; and, as corporations derived from, and subsisting by higher authority, they continued subjed to the controul of that authority. It is impossible, indeed, indeed, to conceive any other idea of a corporation erecdcd by charter, than that it hlould continue fubjedc to the author of'
that charter.

And if they, for their own interest, an xioufy preserved their connecion with Britain, it was clearly her part to keep them in fubjeiion and dependence. For what end did file fend out colonies, but to benefit herself, to extend her commerce and her power, to increase induflry and population, and advance her happiness and prosperity ? Why (hould fle have nourifled and protected them in their infancy, supplied them with the neceflaries of life, and the means of improvement, if fie had not confidered them as part of herself? Why ihould she have fettled them once and again, when driven off by the natives, and encouraged and strengthened them at great expence of blood and of treasure, it not for her own common benefit and theirs? And why have the colonies, for almost two centuries, been such favourite objects of her legislation?
Those who are acquainted with our body of laws, laws, know well how great a part of it refpe&s the colonies. Their affairs of government and commerce are so thoroughly incorporated with that code, that they could not be erased from it, without alinoft dcftr(ying the whole. This of itself fiufficiently ihewvs how much their interefl and ourG6 have been blended together, and firongly marks their dependence on the legislature of Great Britain.

On this subjed, indeed, till of late years, there has been no dispute. The colonifis acknowledged the authority of the King and parliament, and submitted to them on all occafions. In return for their obedience, they claimed the protection of the fiate, which was given them, with every mark of partiality and indulgence. And thus, with all the advantage of distant fettlements for the improvement of their fortunes, they and their poferity remained denizens of Great Britain, with the power of returning when prompted by inclination or wealth, and of enjoying the most ample privileges of native subjeCts. Antient right then furnishes no ground for this revolt.

Let us next fee if it can be justified by recent provocation.

You all know, my brethren, the neceffi ty of taxes for the support of the state.
As we give up part of our natural liberty, and submit to be reltrained by laws, that our persons and property may be safe from the criminal invasions of other men, we likewise yield part of our property to secure the reft: That is, to pay the neceflary expence of government and the execution of the laws; to support the supreme magifirate and his judges and officers in suitable dignity, and to defray the expence of fleets and armies, for the common defence and proteEtion of the whole. And, left the covetous should with-hold his share, the law forces it out of his hoard, that the reft of his fellow-citizens may not pay more than their just proportion. By the happy conftitution of our country, these taxes are not arbitrary demands, but laid on by the representatives of the people, with the content of the house of Lords and the Sovereign ; so that no nation was ever so well secured againft an oppressive or unequal taxation.

To make it compleat, every person within our wide extended empire ihould contribute according to his ability, otherwise the burden must fall unequally.

When the colonies were in their infant slate, struggling with difficulties and with enemies, they were not in a condition to contribute to the common charge. They needed bounties and rewards for their encouragement; and accordingly they received them from the parent-ftate. But afterwards, as their commerce and wealth increased, they were sometimes diretly taxed, as well as the reft of the Britifi dominions, and that as early as the times of Cromwell and Charles the Second, and down. to the period immediately previous to the dispute. These taxes, indeed, were laid on with a sparing hand, because the colonies had but lately emerged from infantweakness: But the authority of the aas of parliament was never disputed till now, and the taxes imposed by them were paid when demanded.

But, if there had been no exercise of this right of the legislature, prior to our own days, the right must have remained entire, because it is eli:; tial to government, founded in justice and equity, and in the law of nature ta i] nations. The supreme power of the slate would, at any time, have been entitled to impose part of the public burden on our fcllow-lubjeds in America, provided tho{e iinpolitions were just and fair. For I do not contend for passive obedience and non-reiiltance to supreme authority:
But then the only jul: ground of reliitance is the oppressive, tyrannical, or unconfiitutiona! exercise of that authority. `

The colonies pretended, at the beginning of th dispute, that it was unccnhtitutional to tax them, because they were not represented in parliament, and a new diftinflion was formed, in their behalf, between the right of legilsation :and that of taxation. Consuetude was .:fficicnt to obviare these obje-ions. All the arguments in support of them have, however, been again and again ably refuted, and particularly of late, in a sermon on a!legiance, by Dr Campbell Principal of the Marillhall College, Aberdeen. See also the rights of Great Britain aflcrted, and an Enquiry into the guilt of the war, &c. by Dr Roebuck.

The Americans, however, do not plead that they were taxed beyond their proportion or ability: They aboblutely deny the right itself. This docrine is entirely new, and is the undoubted offspring of their wealth and power. Let us trace the fats that apparently led them to take arms, as they rife in their order.

After a war, undertaken, as I have said, entirely on account of the colonies, which, though fuccefsfui beyond our mnofl sanguine *wiflhes, was expensive to the en,)rmous extent of near one hundred millions; when, to lessen this grievous burden in a fmrall degree, the slate laid on them an incontider.^ble tax, the amount of which was to be applied to their own internal government, they would not fublnit to it. Though they could neither justly complain of the quantity imposed, nor of the application of the tax, nor plead their inability to bear it; for their trade and-riches were greatly increased; yet they wantonly refused pay ment; and, without the leait provocation, riotously dcltroyed the property of fair merchants, to a great amount, that happened to be the subjea of that taxation. Compenfation was demanded for this great injury to private proprietors, and fatisfation for such a daring affront to the laws. Both were haughtily refused.

On the refusal of fatisfadion for their violation of private property, and outragious contempt of public authority, the legiflature, equitable and steady, enaded laws to punilh the offenders, and to enforce the authority of the state. As it was impoffible to bring the guilty to junice in common form, it became neceflary to punifh the community that screened their crimes; but the penalty was to cease the moment they delivered up the offenders, and made compensation. But the colonifls made choice of the nmoR violent part; they obftruaed the execution of there laws, and an armed force became necessary, as in other ca!es of resistance againfi law.
They attack the troops in the execution of their duty: Then, coinfcious of the atrocious nature of their offence, or rather in the train of a concerted plan, they combine, from Dan to Beersheba, from one extremity of the land to another. ,Trufling to their distance from the parent-flate, and the firength they had acquired under its genial wings, they overturn the antient chartered governments, and ered new ones in their place. They inflame the ignorant multitude. By ieducion, or by force, they arm every man. They oppress his Majesty's loyal fubjeas, and the best friends of the conRfitution, and drive them from their estates and poffeflions *. At las, after various subtile and artful professions, they pull off the mask; they declare themselves an independent republic, make war upon the parent-ftate, and implore the aid and proteaion of fur antient foes, from whom we so lately delivered them.

Such is the recent provocation of which the colonies complain. Such rather are their pretences to justify the effeas of their info lence * Their treatment of the episcopal clergy has been remarkably barbarous, and demonflrates that, to be Whigs with them, men must be of the highest republican and antimonarchial principles The church of En.
gland supports the revolution on good grounds, and, in South Britain, is indisputably the firmest barrier againt fanaticism, either in religion or politics.


lence and pride. They excitethe few by the profpes of ambition: They intangle the many in the mazes of fophiflry. They dignify their own unreasonable claims, lately propounded, by the name of sacrcd rights, though hofile to the conflitution. The inildef execution of the laws, they hold to le tyranny, and jult punilhmncnt, or felf-defence, they exclaim againi: as the molt barbarous murder. Though, in every refped, a part of our dominions, united to this government and subjea to its laws, they asfume the language of a separate ard independent state, and thereupon form reafonsfor acually becoming one; they rebel against lawfulgovernment, and, fiom the necessary consequences of their own conduct, they form arguments to justify rebellion. But these colours are employed only to impose on and deceive the giddy multitude, who are not to be driven to arms without either real or imaginary oppressions. The project is of a more antient date, coeval with the century itself, with the dawn of their wealth and profperity; and, when Canada yielded to the British arms, the long-wifhed for profpe&
at last arose on the cloudy imhagination of the New-England fanatic, the flattering idea ( I5 )

idea of power and independency, and a glorious republic.

It is their ambition, then, that has led them into an unjufi and unprovoked rebellion against the patent-ftate. Let us now inquire, what motives may be derived from expediency to engage us to yield to their claims, or how far we can honourably agree to them.

From the (hort representation I have given of the cafe, you will observe, that this is a war merely in defence of. our eftablilhed constitution and government, and the rights of the state. On our part, it took its rife from a legal attempt to enforce the laws, and preserve their authority. And, though the legiilative powers, in abhorrence of civil diflention, were willing to depart from their just claims; yet their mild propositions were rejeaed with disdain:
And we are now involved in a war, (how tedious, expensive, or bloody, God only knows), in defence of that constitution which was eftabliffed by the wildom, the courage, and fortitude of our forefathers, those venerable ancestors, who proteted and cherished, with so much care, the first inhabitants ( z6 )

inhabitants of our plantations, and imparted to them that freedom which they had so nobly acquired.

Under this government, we have lived with more security and happiness than any nation ever did. In their religion, all men have enjoyed an ample toleration; in their property, undisturbed security; and, in their persons, a liberty inviolate. Far superior to the republics of antiquity, the government of Britain has maintained the rights of human nature, with a happy equality:
And, while the multitude has been an object of her molt tender care, the avenues of laudable ambition have been opened wide to talents and merit of every kind. Not only have we lived equal, and safe, and free, under the government of laws interpreted with equity and adminiftred with moderation, but, in consequence of this peculiar slate, we have attained to the highest degree of national felicity, prosperity, and glory.

Shall we then susser the befl of govern ments to be shaken to its centre, to be invaded, to be dismembered, to be destroyed ?
No, surely; for, besides that the dignity of the state, makes it highly inexpedient to let rebellious iiibjecs go unpunifled, our valuable interelts, and the security of that conflitution which we hold so dear, call upon us to go out to battle agaiIf the children of Benjaminl, our brother. You will observe, that every argument which is used in behalf of the revolted Americans, except what arises from their distance alone, applies equally to many other parts of the British empire; and the views of their adherents on this fide the Atlantic extend, if not to the entire deltruction of this happy government, at leait to so new amodel of it, as would not leave one flone upon another of the ancient and goodly fabric. Without upbraiding the colonists in this place, by observing, that the distance which they now alledge with so much arrogance against our interfering in their affairs, was not pleaded by us when of late they lb humbly implored our protection, it is obvious, that, if the feet, be-cause they are more distant, ihall be suffered to withdraw their fubjeaion from the head, soon will the hands and arms and evcrymem C bar ( is )

ber of the body revolt, in their turn, against their guide and conducor.

But, fay some, it is more expedient to yield even to their unreasonable claims, than to engage in a war so expensive, and so bloody, as this is likely to prove. The first counsels of prudence are not always wife, nor the fitft ditates of humanity always humane. Such counsellors do not confider, that, by one-great exertion to re-establish the authority of the state, we ihall save millions that would be loft in the violent disjun&ion of this mighty empire; that, by carrying on this great war with perseverance and fortitude, we shall prevent innumerable and endless wars that might ensue; and that it is as just and necessary to shed our blood now, in reducing our ungrateful children to a sense of their duty, as it was so lately to defend them against their foes.

Nor is it our interest alone that obliges us to reject their demands, but their interest also. Now, indeed, they are deluded by subtie leaders, ambitious of pre-eminence and power, who have known by what arts to inflame the people, even to madness: Yet they very lately confessed, that, under this government against which they revolt, they have been free and happy, and have grown to that height of wealth and population which, we fiy, has made them forget or defpifeall obligation,and aspire atindependency. What region of the world indeed could boaR of greater felicity ? They enjoyed unbounded liberty of conscience, and civil liberty in perfetion; they were governed by their own laws, that partake of the fame liberal spirit with ours; they possessed a fertile country, and aflourifhing trade;
they paid next to no taxes*; and, in exchange for their fubjetion to the fovereignty of Britain, provincial animosity and rivalfhip was kept within bounds by her controlling power, and foreign hostility was warded off by her fleets and armies. In ihort, the state of mankind was so happy and so inviting in that diflant region, that the mother-country was in danger of being depopulated by the passion with which men were * Not above the soth part of what is paid by every person in Britain.


were seized to go, in quest of prosperity, to that fortunate and favourite clime. While we languified under a heavy debt, contrated on their behalf, they were flourishing in commerce, and increasing in numbers, from the happy effeds of that war which cold us so dear: And the comparion with their fate made ours leem the more grievous.
And yet they at once darken the glory of this golden age by their own perverlity: For, when we call upon them, in the fillnefs of their opulence, to pay a finall proportion of the expence of government, they resist the law that imposes it, and fly to arms. The annals of mankind do not contain a more unprovoked or inexcusable revolt.

Let them not add falf:hood to rebellion!

Let them not lay, that we are the aggreffors! The British parliament had enacted laws that bound the colonies, from their firil establishment. By their charters they were fubjeQed to taxes, and they had been frequently taxed by aats 'of parliament.
Was it a just ground of refinlance to law, that we did not yield at once to their new request to be exempted from taxes ? Was it a foundation for a civil war, after we had put them in a prosperous slate, that they were jealous left we should one day lay heavier taxes upon them ? This might have been the subjet of proper representations, and of new plans offered to the slate; but surely no just cause of war. For what government can give up the antient and eftablifhed mode of raising a revenue, till a new and better method is substituted in its fiead?

I said, that it was for their interest *, no less than ours, that we should reduce the plantations again under the legal govern ment It has been often said in private conversation, That, whatever we may think as Britons, yet surely, were we Americans, we would think and at as they do;
and I have often heard it rashly answered in the affirmative. I call it rashly; for, besides all the ties which ought to bind the people of that country to this state, from allegiance, affection, or gratitude, as the objet of all government is the happiness of the people, a wife and good man would deliberate maturely, before he.
would agree to a change that might, in place of certain freedom and prosperity, introduce the moRl uncertain effects, perhaps slavery and the worst of all govern.
ments.


ment of Great Britain; for, betides the relief that may bejufly expeced by his Majesty's loyal and suffering fubjeds, who have been expelled in great numbers from their homes, and robbed of their property, who can foresee, supposing the revolted colonies to prove successful in their attempt to become independent of the parent Rate, under what form of government they may fall, into what divisions they may be broken, to what foreign yokes some of them may yield, or what species of defpotifin may arife among them ? When the branches fall off from a mighty tree, not only are they deprived of the principle of life that made them flourilh, but the bond that united them together is dissolved. But, on the supposition that they shall remain in union, in cafe of success, and form one great independent late, mufl not that fate be the rival of Great Britain ? and would she not soon subdue our remaining provinces on the.continent, and make herself miltrefs of all our islands in the weft Indies, whence we derive so much wealth and power?
Would not all the arts follow the riling Empire, Empire, and Britain be left a gloomy and desolate isle, to furnish new abodes for the Danes and Normans of a future age?
May heaven avert so great a calamity! I love my country, I revere her constitution.
No form of government ever diffused such equal happiness over the human race.
And shall I fee that sacred temple of liberty reduced to ruins, on the uncertain projet of rearing an Utopia in a diltant land ?
Religion and reason, as well as every feeling of a British heart, forbid me to behold filch a profpe& without grief and indignation. If forget thee, 0 ! Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget its cunning: If I do not remember thee, Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth. Pfal. cxxxi. 5. 6.

To yield to the unreasonable demands of our colonies, would be no less dishonourable, than it is highly inexpedient.

The prosperity of nations depends, under God, in a great measure, on the credit they maintain with their neighbours around them, on their reputation for wisdom and arms.
Such as are ill able to defend themselves, if they have acquired wealth, are so much the more a tempting prey to braver and more warlike nations. It is imprudent to rely entirely on the law of nations, or on the faith of treaties: To be faie, or to preserve peace, a people must be firong; for a name in arms is the most formidable of all barriers. How must we fink, then, in the eyes of all Europe, if we susser our laurels to be torn by our own degenerate and rebellious sons, whom we have long softered with so much care ?
Twenty years are hardly elapsed, since (might we believe their loud supplications)
they were in the utmost danger from their, neighbouring colony of Canada. To have listened to them, one would have believed, that fifty thousand Canadians were enough to have driven no less than two millions of British Americans, that is, fort- times their own number, from their abodes and possesfions,fron their cities and their havens, and overwhelmed them in the Atlantic ocean. On their alarms and complaints, we engaged in that most expensive war. They had not then roused their warlike spirit; they referved it for rebellion; but retired behind the shield of Britain;. and it was owing to their unmanly countenance and feeble defence, that the enemy gained so much ground, as made it difficult to expel him. At length he was expelled-from our dominions; and, to deRroy the very root of fear in time coming,.
all the colonies of the enemy on that continent were subdued, and, at the peace, more important conquests were ceded, to retain the former as provinces to the parent-ftate.
What return have we received for placing them in a state of perfect security ? They have become proud, and turned against their deliverers. The indignant spirit of the nation mull rife on the baseness of their conduet; and the recentness of the benefit heightens the guilt of their ingratitude *.

D . To * It may be said, that gratitude is not avirtue to be ex pe&ed from one nation to another: But that I deny; for, though it is not wife always to trust to the good faith of nations, because their governors may be prefidious, yet, without julfice, and good faith, and gratitude, all the great societies of men would be no better than robbers or banditti. Besides, the Americans are not another nation, (on which fuppolition, there has been much false reasoning), but apart of Britain, united to it by every tye.


To ingratitude they have added the mofl false and insidious arts. At first they make the most ample declarations of duty and allegiance to the King: They profess the warmest desire of preserving their connection with this goveinment: They difclaimn all pretentions to independency: They assec to lay themselves at the foot of the throne, imploring deliverance from the thraldom of parliament: And, firange to tell, are delirous of fubiitting to the will of one man, in order to be freed from the government of laws. But, when our Sovereign, like atrue friend of liberty, refers theircomplaints to the great council of the nation, this wisdom and virtue difgul their poisoned minds, and they spurn at that royal authority which they pretenu ro revere. They frame false and infidious addresses to the neighbouring colonies, whom, for their loyalty, they had just now treated with the utmost contempt. They even attempt to mislead the inhabitants of these ilands. Thyc endeavour to ihake our allegian. e to the King. and to destroy our reverenc: for the constitution. They try to pervert our undciert;,:J;nds, to reduce our willsinto revolt. They would convinceus, that despotism is etablifhed, while we feel that we are governed only by laws: And that we are a wretched nation of slaves, while we enjoy perfect freedom under the mildest administration. And, to crown all their insults on our underlandings, they at last break out with their declaration of independency, their first and darling objed, which they concealed so long under a cloud of grievances and fears. Turning their aversion and malice from the parliament on the King, they represent our mild and gracious Sovereign, who reveres the laws, and supports the constitution, as the most cruel, vindiaive, and despotic tyrant.

But why need I enumerate their iniideenis After the most violent outrage on private property, the mos haughty refusal of satisfation when demanded, and the most daring refinance to the execution of the laws, they have resorted to open rebellion to juitify their conduct. T hey are in arms againit their country. They have mustered a force which they deemn invincible: Their ships of war cover the ocean: Their hosts of armed men croud the flore of the vast Atlantic.

They lift themselves up against that paternal arm which so long cherished and proteted them: They would sheath the sword in those bowels from whence they sprung. Liberty was but a pretence, for they were always free; independence was their aim. They complained of grievances that did not exist, and mustered up phantoms of ideal apprehenfions, that, under the colours of pall or present oppression, and jealousy of the future, they might raise such a power as would cancel those obligations they were unwilling to repay.

Who then can doubt for a moment on whom tolay the guilt of this war? T he faithful magifirate who stops his ear to the criminal's desire to escape from justice, or the kind parent who does not yield to the unreasonable demands of a froward child, may as well be accused as Great Britain on this occasion. The very name of Brethren, by which, with all the ties that it implies, we have so often been obtested to desist from this cruel and unnatural war, demonfirates the jultice and necessity of it on our part, since it points out their connecion with us, marks their dependence andobligations, and 29 )

and aggravates the treachery and violence of their conduct. These unsteady measures with which they have upbraided us; that lenity which they have conltrued into incapacity to govern; that reluctance to punish, which they held to be weakness and fear;
now that, from seditious fubjeats, they have become open enemies, are so many incitements to us, to ad with unanimity and vigor.

Let us, then, no longer hesitate, Whether we fhallgo out to battle againJf the children of Benjamin our Brother, or j/hall cease.
The oracle of reason (and the sacred oracles support it) obliges us to conclude, that it is most expedient and honourable, as well as just and necessary for the ltate, our common parent, to bring back by force this favourite and froward child, made rebellious by indulgence, to a just sense of his duty, and to the happiness he so long enjoyed in his father's house.

I come now, in the second place, as I proposed, to point out our duty, in the present circumstances, to God and to our country.

And here, without queflion, we ought, in the first place, to confess and lament our fins, and to turn to God and our duty.
Ior, though we cannot be accused of any guilt in refpet of the immediate occasions or grounds of this war, yet, as they lie in the order of Providence, 1 am asfraid we cannot clear ourselves of blame.

From the beginning of the world unto this day, fin has occafioned-the downfall of nations and of kingdoms. Infidelity and irreligion, neglect of God and of his worship, and the most licentious morals, as they are intimately conneCted together, so have they generally preceded the declenfion and fall of states. And who can deny, that these are theJigns of the times ?
that these are the strong features of iniquity which mark the present age?

If men retain found principles, however much they may fiSometimes depart from them in practice, being led away by temptation and the error of the wicked; yet there is hope that they may one day return to theirduty, because a slumbering conscience may Rill awaken, and dying principles again revive.

But what can be expected, when there is a profelted disbelief of all moral diftindions, when truth, and jufice, and honesty, and the love of our country, and indeed every principle but daring ambition and vile felf-interef. are ridiculed, despised, and exploded ?
While the inferior ranks of men are corrupted, by the delire of gain or pleasure, into fraud or profligacy of manners, the fuperior ranks fall sacrifices to luxury and esfeminacy. Infead of the manly pursuits that would lead thein to acquire fuchtalents and qualities, as might enable them to adorn and detend their country, and strengthen her constitution, they waste their health and fortunes in everlasting gaming and voluptuoufnefs, and in all the modes of living that debate or debilitate the mind, no less than the body. I speak only of the many; for, God be praised, we have still tome in the higher ranks of life, who would do honour to the most virtuous age: We have still some, who, in spite of the infection of the times, think it glorious to lead or to join the fleets and armies of their country, and are now exposing their lives in defence of that conflitution, which, of old, was the nurse of patriots and heroes.

But, when we confider our fad degeneracy, uponthe whole, mufl we not confess, that we are afinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, afeed of evil doers, Ifai. i. 4. &c. and may we not fland juflly amazed to confider, that even the God of all patience should have born with us so long, and suffered our profligate manners? When we reflect on the high degree of prosperity and glory to which this nation was raised in the last war, by the hand of the God of battles, and confider our own dreadful ingratitude, by the fad abuse of our great and singular privileges; have we not jult reason to fear that God is now faying to us, as he said formerly to the Jews, Shall Inot visit, for the/e things, faith the Lord? andJhall not my foul be avenged onfuch a nation as this ?

What then can be more proper, on such a day as this, than to deprecate God's difplealure, andjoin in humble supplications tohim, that he would be pleased to avert thofedreadful judgments that hang over us, and which we have such just cause to fear may fall upon us! What can we do, but every one of us this day commence a thnroti,h rcformation ofthofe particular vices and crimes, which, though small in our eyes, accu.:.ulate the mighty fu.n of national guilt ? 'nd let us join the holy prophets of Israel, who, on their solemn days of fafiing and prayer, besought God to remove his judgments, and turn away his anger from them: And, particularly, let us join with the prophet Daniel, when he thus addresses the almighty, Dan. ix. 6. &c. O ! Lord, accordingto all thy rtighteoufinef, 1 befiech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jeru/alenm, thy holy mountain: because, for our fins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us, &c.

I have mentioned in general that torrent of corruption which overwhelms this nation, and may be the cause (as it has been in other ages and regions of the world), why God should now visit us with fore calamities. But this observation applies to other nations as well-as to us. Let us try if we can point out some particular grounds of fear, which are more peculiarly applicable to our own country, that we may lament and correct them as far as we can. For, though the plans and conduct of providence are laid deep, and are carried on in silence and darkness, yet the moral causes that undermine the greatness of nations, may sometirnes be traced. Allow mc to mention a few that seem to me to have been immediately productive of our present danger.

The i/t I illall mention is unbounded ambition, and national pride.

In the late war, which was undertaken in defence of the colonies, though we were at firfl unsuccessful; yet the spirit of the nation being roused at last, and well conducted, we were victorious in every quarter of the globe, and left not our enemies a single province or island that could be the subject of contest. When the negociations for peace were entered upon, you may remember how difficult it was for his Majesty's prudent and moderate ministers to frame such a peace as would please the people; and, after it was made, there arose a storm of violence and clamour that has hardly fitbfided to this day. Nothing less would satisfy the national pride and ambition, than the retaining all the conquests their arms had made. Time and experience have flewn the truth of what some then boldly averred, that we kept by far too many of our conqueRts; enow indeed to threaten perpetual commotions, if not downfal to the state. To the retaining of Canada for the security of the Americans, it is entirely owing that they have become so insolent as to rebel against the parentstate. And, in so great and unwieldy an empire, we may expec convulsions everyday.

The great objec of a free Rate ought to be to perpetuate its liberty; and no temptation of wealth or of power should ever feduce such a Rate into a conduct that may prove fatal to its chief object. History proves, that great conuefts have always been ruinous to free governments: And similar causes will operate similar effees to the end of the world. Such dominions are too unwieldy to be governed. If they consist of fertile regions, in climes favourable to human nature, they are in danger of depopulating the mother-country : If they are barren and unhofpitable deserts, they are not worth the expence of retaining them.

Europe, for fomne centuries past, has been themoft flourishing quarter of the world.

The govcrtnmrnts of it, though various, have been balanced by eachi other; and the people in general have been happy even under the n:oit dcfpot:c fcrms it contains, because the views and conJuf of princes have becc moderatdt b)y ;icir mutual jealousies.
Was it for us, who I;d exclainmed lb loudly againi} universal m onarchy, and had laid out fb much blood and treasure to oppose those ambitious p:lwers, who, at different per'ods,l were iu!rpoed to have conceived the idea, was it fir us to extend our dominions from pole to pole, and to all the fliores that are wathed by the Indian or Atlantic oceans ? Was it wiic in a free Rate to raise such a jealoulf in other states, as wxould produce a combination againf: us, which mioht one day prove our ruin, whether we conquer or are conquered ? For, in the first cafe, we Ihould certainly perish by our own corruption, as, in the fcond, by the pomwer of the enemy.

To tiis caule is prcbably owing that weakn.is cf government, which has been of late so much felt and' complained of, and which no capacity seems hitherto able to repair.


repair. 1 mean, the machine of government itself, (not the adminiifration of it), which has lot mnuch of the spring and energy it had in former times; witness the infamous abhue that has been suffered, the dangerous tumults that have passed unpuniflled, and the relaxation of the executive power, even in refpedt of crimes against itself. In vain has opposition, with her warning voice, and fahcion, with her clamorous tongue, ascribed this imbecillity to the hands who direca the machine; for the chiefs of every party in the Iate have directed, in their turns, with no better success. And no wonder that it is so; for the internal force that was fufficient to move those wheels of government, which so long guided these happy islands, and their ancient colonies, could not fail to prove too weak, when loaded with new conquests, distant as the extremities of the globe, and larger than all our former dominions. Such are the effects of unbounded pride and ambition: And such are the rebukes which the wife providence of God has contrived for the haughtiness of man.

In the 2d place, Let me mention, as one of the more immediate causes of our present danger, that unbounded licentiousness, which, for a long time, has prevailed in writing and discourse.

The liberty of the press is indeed a most sacred right of Britifl freedom; but, like all other privileges, it may be abused, and, and when it is, may be produtive of the most pernicious consequences. No character has been sacred enough to be safe from the torrent of calumny and reproach, which, f)r fiome time pall, has poured itself upon the public ear. The most private afylum of domestic peace has not been secure against that malignant poison that glides in every breath, and is scattered about on every page. The throne has been openly attacked; and not only have the measures of government been arraigned, as in former times, but the legislature itself has been ridiculed, traduced, and almolt libelled in its own hearing. And what is the consequence of this vile licentiousness ? Has the tongue of sedition, and the pen of faction proceeded to such outrage, that they are now no longer believed ? That may be true with refpea to the characters of individuals; but we may reft assured, that the unbounded freedom which has been used has lessened the relped due to the Soveregin; has destroyed that reverence in which the legislature Ihould be held; and, while itj has overawed the magistrate in the execution of his office, it has, at the fame time, impaired the dignity and weakened the force of the laws themselves. We may be certain, that this rampant licentiousness has overturned all ideas of subordination, which is the bond that holds men in society together, and prepared their minds to meet, without concern, if not to wish for, a revolution of government.

How can we otherwise account for the publications that have proceeded from men of gravity, of professedly good intentions, and of no mean talents *? With what other view, than to a revolution, have those elaborate treatises been composed; or what other can be the aim of their authors, who, amidst pro * See the works of the Reverend Dr Price, aad others.


professions of allegiance too, take so much pains to decry the present government of Britain, and to present us with an idea of something infinitely more perfet, which we are soon to fee eftablilhed in America, and which they seem to wifli, and hope may likewise take place at home ? But a repu-'
blic of such unbounded extent, as that of America would prove, is an experiment that remains to be tried in the hiftoryof the world. We know that our ancestors tried it in vain, within far narrower limits. They, too, had great expectations of that perfeetion to which human government was going to arrive: They believed that a millennium, and the kingdom of the faints, was at hand: But they were sadly deceived; for they found, in their fiead, the iron sceptre of an usurper, supported by military force.

There is a line Somewhere between the liberty of the press, and that licentiousness which would subvert the very government which supports the liberty of the press.
When the times are calm, that line will be found out and applied.

Allow me to mention, as one other more immediate cause of the present danger, in the 3d place, The murders, and rapines, and enormities that have been committed in various places of the British empire, and uill remain unaccounted for, unpunilhcd, and unarraigned.

Besides, that filch inflances of impunity to great crimes, demonitrate the \veakneis of the executive power, and tend to increase corruption, making men more daring and obllinate by their pernicious example, they likewifc continue to cry to almighty Gcd for vengeance: For blood mufl have blood. And who can fay that the God of heaven is not now stretching out his arm to recompense those nations who have that guilt Rill hanging on their heads ? The Indian tribes of America have almost entirelyvanifhed, through the treachery or cruelty of the new possessors. Those very colonies, who plead so high for liberty, and alledge that they have taken up the sword only in its defence, under pretence of driving out the heathen, (a pretence in Christians no !ess impious than it is bloody,) by barbarous F policy, policy, or by force, have almost wholly eradicated the ancient inhabitants of those regions; while they hold thousands and ten thousands of wretched Africans under a cruel bondage, from which the most painful death would be a joyful deliverance.

Can we believe, that deeds have been committed in another quarter of the globe, by natives of these islands, that will make the odious names of Cortes and Pizarro be forgotten, and slain the British annals to the latest poflerity ? In times of ignorance and bigotry, the minds of men have been known to run a career of enthusiastic fury that aftonilhed themselves when they became cool; and stern war is an apology for the most atrocious actions. But, in a period enlightened likethe present, in profound peace, amidst intercourses of mutual confidence, and thb mild operations of commerce, to surpass all former ages in perfidious barbarity! Ah! Cursed thirst of gold! thou canst transform man, even when refined and civilized, into a furious beast of prey!

Nor can we, as a nation, clear ourselves of the guilt of tlefe great crimes, if we have suffered thole under our controul to commit them with impunity: Or if, after making cxtenfive conquefls, we have robbed innocent and defenceless nations of the benefit and protetion of their ancient governments, without establishing new ones in their flead:
Thus leaving them an easy and a tempting prey to avarice and cruelty. The bloody and deceitful man, the vengeance of God will surely overtake.

But, in the midst of all our fubjeds of confession and sorrow and lamentation, whether of a private or public nature, and with a firm resolution to contribute all in our power to correct what is amirs, and to do our utmo.f for the national welfare, by carefully keeping every man of usfrom his iniquity, now that the Hofl has gone forth againfl the enemy, we shall do well also to turn our thoughts on the peculiar and seafonable blessings which the Almighty has poured down upon us, left, if we ihould fail to mark them, or prove ungrateful for them, he may turn a deaf ear to our lupplications for farther mercies.

Amrong such peculiar and seasonable blef sings, we are to rank the plentiful crop which he hath heftowed on us in all corners of the land; insomuch, that we shall have no dependence on foreign nations, who might have taken advantage of our necessity. We ought also to mark, with gratitude, the providential opening of new channels of trade for all our manufadures, the demand for which has increaled beyond our most fanguine expedations, jult tin the moment when the breach with the colonies might have occalioned a molt dreadful calamity.
Let us trace the over-ruling hand of heaven to(, in the present peaceful disposition of our potent neighbours, who seem to attend nore to the general interest of Europe, than to yield to the dictates of national rivalfhip and animosity. Let us likewise observe, with pleasure and thankfulness, the alacrity and courage of our soldiers in the cause of their country, after much inidilous pains had been taken to make them cool and backward in the service. Let us, with the warmed gratitude and praise, mark the ardour and fuccess with which they defend that antient government, which the pretended ibns of liberty spurn 43 )

ipurn at with contempt, whilfl they fly before that manly spirit which is its genuine produd ; and let us return thanks and blefiings to the Lord of Hofls, the God of battles, by whose inspiration alone heroes and patriots are formed, who girdeth our loins to might, and teacheth our hands to war.

It would be highly improper, it would be impious indeed, to apply the oracle of God in the present cafe, and to fay, with prophetic authority, Go uip,for to morrow the Lord will deliver them into ycur hands.
No ; this I may not venture to fay. The event is in the womb of providence ; and the iace is not always to the wist, nor the battle to theJflong, for God often counteraas the probability of second causes. But this I will fay, in opposition to the authors of feeble and timid counsels, that a righteous cause, and persevering valour, joined to a pious truftt in the Almighty, give the belf ground to hope for success in war.

In the wars usual in Europe, when rival nations have contended with each other, it has often been on points of small importance, and the parties have gained nothing in the end by the contefl, but the exercire of arms. In such wars the interests of mankind in general are safe. For that equal balance which has been maintained so long in the great European republic, does not admit of one nation's making large encroachments, or conquests, on another. But, in the present war, we are to retain, or lose forever, not our new provinces, that are hardly yet a part of the fate, but our antient colonies, that are coeval with our navigation and commerce, those great branches that are deeply engrafted into the commonwealth, which have grown with our growth, and cannot now be lopt off, without hazard that the tree Shall thereby perish. An objet of such importance requires national fortitude and perseverance.

As Christians, and as men, no doubt, we ought to wish and pray for peace. Every thing in the present cafe prompts us to such a prayer; but always with this condition underlood, that it be equitable and safe.
How far we may hope for a return of asfedion and allegiance from the present generation of colonists, who are now in aaual rebellion against the British goverhment, I pretend not to fay. God can turn the hearts of men as he pleases, in opposition to common rules. But one thing is clear and certain, that, as the sword should not be drawn against the fubjeds of the state, without the most urgent necessity, so should it not be Iheathed without full security and submission on the part of the offenders;
for a peace, on any other terms, would only prove a short and dangerous truce, to prepare them for a fresh revolt.

Fully employed in our own private oc cupations, far removed from the feat of war, and in perfe&d repose, we are apt to be indifferent to the interests of our country, and careless about that very government that gives us security and repose, till we are roused by such a call as this, to reflect on the blessings we enjoy. Let us feel the generous spirit of Britons, rising with just indignation against those degenerate and rebellious colonists, who would rob us of our glory, and defiroy that sacred temple of the constitution, that can only secure their liberty and ours. And, as our patriotism thould 48 )

should be roused, so should our loyalty; for, on this occasion, they mufR go hand in hand together. In times of peace and tranquility, the exercise of this duty is not always apparent, even in the most faithful fubjeds. They are not called upon to perform any as of fealty; and, being at a diftance from the feat of government, the personal qualities, and even the royal dignity of the sovereign, seems to be forgotten.
But, when disturbance or danger approach, those principles and affetions that lay dormant, soon awaken with the alarm, and the most zealous loyalty appears in the condua of every good citizen.

Let us now support the throne, for it is fiaken! Let us unite in warm affeCtion to our King, whose character, like the fun, hfines the brighter for the spots with which facion and rebellion, for a while, have endeavoured to obscure it. And let us demonstrate our patriotism and loyalty, not by loud and empty professions, but by a meek andrefpe&ful spirit to those that are set over us, by our reverence for the laws, laws, and thankfulness to heaven, that we are fill under their government.

Above all, let us not 1upprefs that war like ardour for which we have ever been diflinguithed. Without magnanimity and valour, wealth and power are precarious, and wisdom and liberty but empty names.
To be secure, we must be brave. All America is now in arms; shall we remain feeble and unwarlike ? The plough and the loom must be left for a while, that we may not be obliged to abandon them for ever. For, if the Almighty does not interpose to subdue the minds of our domeflic foes, or if we do not exert our native flrength, in vain ihall we think to conquer them by foreign hands. If we could, they might, perhaps, in future, learn tofear thefeverityofa mafler, but neveragain would they revere the authority of a parent.

Since, then, my brethren, to yield to the claims of America would be inexpedient and dishonourable; since the war is juRt and neceffary, let us prosecute it with vigour, with chcarfulnefs and perseverance, till the rebellious children of our brother Benjamin find, that the fame ardent national spirit that could cherish, can also corret; and that the fame powerful arm that firetched across the Atlantic to save, is not now so weak but it can punish. Thus shall we do all in our power to preserve to pofterity a government, the most favourable to human nature that ever existed, and to prolong theperiod of light, and liberty, and happiness among mankind.

But, while we are of necessity at war with the children of Benjamin our brother, let us not forget the near relation they stand in to us; let us not entirely extinguish our affeaions to the child, because he is for the present froward and disobedient. Let us bend his will, but not subdue his spirit. Let us chastise him in kindness, not lay him in anger. Like good King David, when his son Absalom rebelled against him, Let us give our captains and our mighty men a charge, that they deal gently with the young man; and, when he returns to his duty, let us receive him with open arms. AMEN.
