The TENDENCY Of the CONSTITUTION of the CHURCH of SCOTLAND, to form the TEMPER, SPIRIT, and CHARACTER of her MINISTERS 

PSAL. xlviii. I2, 13, Walk about Zion, andgo rolund about her: tell the towers thereof: Mark ye well her bzlwuarks, coifider her palaces: that ye may tell it to the generation following.
1 T is an important queflion, what effet moral causes have in forming the characers of men, since on that depend the utility and excellence of laws and inftitutions. For if natural causes solely, or chiefly, operate on the human mind; if men are formed like plants, by the heat of the fun, and the fertility of the foil; the labours of the sage and the legislator are in vain: But if, on the other hand, they can be moulded by discipline and laws, and may attain to dignity and virtue by the force of wife inftitutions, the best service that can possibly be done them, is to bring them under the power of good government, or to preserve it among them when already eftablilhed.

IT is with a view to this question, that I propose, in this discourse, to confider the conifitution of the CHURCH of SCOTLAND;
not as it is founded in the word of God, or as it is agreeable to the plan of the primitive times; more important propositions still, which have often received as much illuftration, and been confirmed with as much proof, as the nature of the thing would admit; but only in certain points, as it is connected with focietv, and as its external laws and regulations, that are of human invention, have a tendency to form the temper, character, and spirit of its members. The goodness of its institutions, in this refpeit, I fhail beg leave to confider as the towers, bulwarks, and palaces of our Z; ON, which help at once to protect and adorn her; which will recommend her to the love and reverence of all her sons; and prove, by one argument more, that, even in her outward fabric, the is not unworthy of that wjfdom which cometh from above.

MY Reverend FATHERS andBRI THREN, I hope, will forgive me, for attempting a subjet, which I humbly apprehend becomes me better, than if I held up a model for their behaviour as ministers of CHRIST; which has often been done by masterly hands, on such occasions. I am sure they will hear me with candour on points with refpee to which I may be so liable to mistake; and on which I shall, nevertheless, speak with freedom, prompted 'by the love of my own order, and veneration for this CHURCH.

IN discoursing of this fubjeat to an audi ence of another kind, I should firfl delineate the conffitution of this CH U R H, as consisting of different orders, formed into fubordinate judicatories, with all the powers of government so equally and properly divided, as to make a republic of no imperfel kind, But this is so well underifood by my reverend hearers, that it would be impertinent in me to consume their time upon it.

IT shall therefore be the chief object of this discourse, to fliew the tendency of the conifitution of the CHURCH of SCOTLAND to form the temper, spirit, and character of her members. And this, by the blessing of God, I ihall endeavour to point out in three material instances, that refpec them as minifters, as BF.ITONS, and as men. For I wvill 1few, in the if; place, The tendency of our ecclesiastical constitution, to preserve good morals, and purity of doctrine.

2d.l/, Its tendency to inspire us with the love of liberty, and the free government of our country.

d7;. Its tendency to form the personal characer of its members.

I am, isJ, To si1ew- the tendency of our eccleiaftical conftiution to preserve good morals, and purity of docirine.


THE apostle PAUL, speaking of the mini fters of the gospel, requires it as their first quality, that they be blameless, or irreproachable, i TI M. iii. z; for thisreafon no doubt, left the people, to defend themselves from their rebukes or censures, Ihould fay, Phjfician, heal thyself! a reproach, that, whenever it falls with julfice, takes from them all liberty of speech, and obliges them to tolerate vice, and to fear the vicious. For though their charater and miflion is independent of the merit of their lives, yet the bulk of mankind are neither refined nor equitable enough to make this distinction;
but when they despise a man's private asions, they will despise his public miniftrations too.

IN other churches, the pomp and splendor of worship, the power and dignity of the fuperior clergy, and their temporal wealth and dominion, will preserve influence and re ipe&
to their order, even after corruption of manners has crept in among them. But the members of this H R C H, without dignities, without power, without wealth and dominion, hold their ascendant over the minds of men, only by their virtue and abilities.

AND happy is it for us, that, being men of like frailty with others, we are laid under the restraint of discipline: a discipline by the laws of the realm still vested in this cH UR CH, by which she can not only exclude from her highest privileges such of her lay-members as lead vicious and disorderly lives, but entirely expel such corrupt ecclesiastics as bring disgrace upon their order: a discipline that, though strict in its own nature, yet is mild and gentle in its execution; for the censorial power is committed to the most subordinate court that has jurifdidion over the clergy;
its inspection is near, its vigilance perpetual;
and, by giving check to the first appearance of faults, it prevents their growing into crimes.

BY the nature of our constitution; there is little danger that the CHURCH mhould become remiss in the exercise of her discipline:
for the depends on that, in a great measure, for the esteem mhe has in the world, and for her influence over the people, to whom the last appeal is made in the trials of a candidate for the ministry, for they are at liberty to objet to his morals or his dotrine ; so that the virtue and credit of her members are deeply interested in the execution of it.
Her discipline is still further secured by this means, that as there is a perfect equality among all those in whom the censorial power is vefied, the connection of protecion and dependence, which has a tendency to screen faults, and to flatter vices, cannot take place;
but, on the contrary, the jealousy and rivalIhip of a republican spirit, will never fail to favour the firic execution of the laws.

WHAT I have said with respect to the mo.

rals of the clergy, extends also to the duties of the patforal office, the diligent execution whereof is committed to the fame watchful care. It likewise applies to doctrine, the purity of which it is necessary to secure.
For as the minds of men are not formed to think exactly in the fame manner on all points, and as the love of singularity, ordiftinction, might carry them far, were they at liberty to give vent to their peculiar opinions, it is a wife restraint, that confines our public teachings within certain limits prefcribedby the CHURCH. Hard as this may seem to bear on liberty of conscience, there cannot be a national church without it; for if full freedom was allowed to the extravagant fancies of men, they would soon divide, and branch out into a thousand different sects. It is necessary too, that the magifirate, who is to protect the public religion, should know what it is, and have it clearly defined.

BUT it may, perhaps, be objeced to what I have said on this point, that the sac is againft me; and that our discipline, which I have represented to be of so much utility, and of so much force, has, in reality, loft its effect. This I cannot think clear, by anyv means: for it is much more probable, tiat the complaints on this head should take their rife from that peeviih humour, which, in every age, leads men to depreciate the worth and virtue of the present times, when compared to the former ; or to a spirit of faction, to an alteration of manners, or to some other less obvious source; than that our constitution of government, without any visible cause, should have loft its vigour, or the principles I have mentioned no longer operate on the human mind.

BUT, my Reverend FATHERS and BRE T H RE N, let us look round us into the world, and we ihall do ourselves the justice that the reft of mankind are willing to do us; for, in this respect, there are no ecclesiastics that stand higher in the general esteem, than the clergy of the CHURCH of SCOTLAND. And, in fact, after all the complaints that have been made, of degeneracy, and corruption of morals, of what crimes have they been guilty ? Of what kind, and of what number have they been convicted ? What ordcr of men can boait of so many members whose characers are unfullied even with the imprutation of crimes? They are not angels,but men:
They cannot boast of perfect innocence and virtue; they do not pretend to an exemption from the infirmities of human nature: And if now and then, a man of like pafion.s with others, has yielded to the force of temptation, and surfered the jufI punilhment preicribed by the laws of the CHURCH, is not this a firo:ngr proof of the goodneis of our discipline, than of the licentiousness of our mrcrals IF tome guilty persons have escaped, is that to cb imputed to the corruption of our courts, rather than to the imperfedion of all human tribunals: Are not the essential fonrs or tial to be observed, without which the innocent could not be safe ? For what crime has any person been tried and acquitted of late, before cur judicatories, of so deep a die, as it would be for a member of our sitwreinme court, in his capacity of a judge or juirmlan, to decide in a particular cafe, upon impr'clns of charater received out of Cecrs, or on his own general ideas of expeCdienc-: ?nd public gocd .ce can I readily admit that our difci !.nue h.-s of iate growln more remiss, or that !e or.l-s of t:. cicrgy- are now less pure, *t:.n ill cr.rer periods of this CHURCH. For lv.-.ci. !at- nl any ilrefs on the general G; .i-a.:ion, That great crimes are leail cii-tr n i:n :er:cds of refinement, when mens minds are foftcned by the progrefs of knowledge and the arts, and brought under habitual restraint by the flability of legal goverment; I apprehend, that the complaints on this head may be, in a great measure, accounted for, by attending to a plain dililnlionbetween IMAN^NERS and MORALS.

IGNORANCE and fuperfition, from age to age, have fixed on things quite indifferent in their own nature, and, by stamping on them the characters of vice and virtue, have rendered it extremely easy for the artful and designing to impose upon mankind, and raise a charader of sanctity, at the finall expence of being rigid and exact in trifles, that have no connection with religion or moraiity ; like the Pharisees of old, who paid tithes of mint, ani/e, and ciuimin, but neglec7ed the weightier matters of the la w, jtudgment, merec), and faith. But the incredal of knowledge, and the progress of society, have restored many of there artificial virtues and vices to their own class again: and while religion and virtue have, in reality, gained by this alteration of manners, the ignorant and fuperfiitious, (for there are some in all ages), continue fill to think them of the fame importance as before, and judge of characters by the false standard of former times.

WH A T then is called MIANNERS, in gene ral, or even the DECORUM of a particular charac'er, are not properly the objecs of laws and discipline. No rules can be prefcribed for modes that are changing every day, no landard can be fixed for what is shifting continually; but every person must be left to the corrections of ridicule and contempt from the world, which are always applied to singularity, affectation, and indecency. Yet, even in this refpec, the minilters of this CHURCH are aided by her init-tufions : lor this ipecies of faults, though not subjects of law, are liable to the private ac.dmlonitons. and fraternai rebukes, of the cerforiia pov-er.

So far then as la. -s and regulations, and the ieftrailrs of diicicline, conduce to make men virtuous, or to keep them lb, the conifitutioi of the CHURCH of SCOTLAND has been wifely framed. I proceed, in the 2d  place, To fllew its tendency to inspire us with the love of liberty, and the free government of our country.

BE SIDES the sentiments natural to a BRI TON born since liberty was eftablifled by law; betides the liberal education of clergymen, and their early acquaintance with those books of antiquity that inspire mankind with elevated thoughts, and the love of freedom which reigned in the state of society they describe; there are circumstances peculiar to this cHURcH, which muff endear the free constitution of their country, more to her members than to other men.

WH EN the reformation was first attempt ed in SCOTLAND, under that form which is now eftabliihed, and which had the inclinations of the people in every age; it was not only for the rights of conscience that our forefathers struggled and fought, .but for the rights of men: they made war not only on priests, but on tyrants; and when thev conquered, they eftablifihed civil liberty, as the only guardian of true religion. The hard contentions of the times had, of themselves, a tendency to route and enlarge the mind ; and being engaged against the fame enemies, and involved in one common cause with the patriots, in every period of our hiiory, the PRESBYTERIANS appeared ftrenuous afiertors of the liberties of mankind, and of their country. On the other hand, during all the efforts of illegal power, our CHUR CH, as one of themoft determined and formidable foes of tyranny and tyrants, was sure to feel the firit effets of their wrath;
at least, examples of lenity were so rare, that ihe was not deceived into the false confidence, that such flattering suspensions of hostility were designed to produce.

AND not only are the members of this CHURCH excitcd to the love of liberty, by their attachment to their friends, and their avefion to their enemies; but our very mode of government, and its genius and spirit, must form the mind to liberty, independent of the connec'ion of interests, or our attachment to the ILLUSTRIOUS FA1MILY on the throne, and our gratitude for the many blessings we have derived from them: For equality, which is the foundation of freedom, is the foundation of our ecclesiastical conflitution too; and the spirit of democracy is so entirely preserved in all its institutions, laws, and forms, that none of her members can possibly be subjects of any other than a firee fiate.

BUT this is a quality that our CHURCH has always been owned to poflefs; and to such a degree, that her enemies have endeavoured to represent it as one of the worst of her faults. For it was long objected to the PRESBYTERIANS, that they were of such a turbulent and seditious spirit, so violent and factious, as to be incapable of rule, and particularly incompatible with monarchical government, such as that of BRITAIN has ever been. But, on ftrit inquiry, this very complaint will be found to conduce to their praise: For in what times were they turbulent and seditious ? Only in the times of tyranny; when to submit, was to degrade human nature; when to be peaceable, was to be a save. But, under the government of laws, with a race of KI NG s on the throne who have asserted and enlarged, not encroached on the rights of mankind, no church in the world has been more obedient or more loyal. Witness her condu&t in every period of danger to the state; witness her unshaken attachment, her active zeal, in the rebellions that have of late torn the bowels of our country.

BEFORE the principles of toleration, that do so much honour to the last age, were established, the CHURCH of SCOTLAND was, no doubt, often seized with a spirit of violence against other denominations of Christians, that, had fie been singular in that respect, would have juitly rendered her an object of aversion. But this was far from being the cafe: file was not, in this point, more ignorant, or more revere, than her neighbour-churches; and having often felt the heaviest hand of persecution, it was no wonder that fle was sometimes violent and unrelenting in her turn. But for half a century past, since the minds of men have become calm and steady under a legal government, and since the ardent zeal of enthufiafm has given place to, or been tempered, by the benign principle of CHRISTI A CHARITY, the CHURCH of SCOTLAND has demonstrated the truth of that position of a great author, " That uniformity is an idea " of weak and vulgarminds:" For infubmifsion to thelaws, in loyalty to the CROWN, and in liberal and generous sentiments to those who differ from her, she is outdone by no church in the world.

IN this view, the CHURCH of SCOTLAND may be confidered as of great utility to the public; for without power or temporality to make her dangerous, the breeds a set of men with principles of freedom, who afting in a body, and having an ascendant over the minds of the people, mull, while uni'ducedl and uncorrupted, be one of the bulwarks of the slate. Before the happy mra of the union, the commons of S o T L A ND, led by attachmlent to their chiefs, or prompted by religious zeal, appeared often indeed in the field, on the fide of liberty; but it was a liberty they neither enjoyed nor underflood. And on account of certain untoward circumstances that relate to the bails of government in this country, the diftinc sense and knowledge of civil and political liberty, has not diffifed itself so far among them as might have been expeced. But the clergy of this CHURCH, fully fenfble of the blesings we enjoy, and well-infTructed in the nature of government, in some degree compensate for this defect;
for they fill up the middle rank between the commons and their Superiors, and, in their intercourse with the people, fail not to impress them with just ideas of the rights of men and of BRITONS, and to inspire them with that love of the public which binds them t- their country. While they retain their characder for piety and good morals, they will not abuse this influence over the people: when they depart from it, and become vicious and corrupt, they will no longer be believed.

BUT I proceed. in the 3d place, To point out the tendency of our ecciefiaflical constitution, to form the perfonal characters of its members.


IT is thought, that allmen receive a certain caRl, or turn of charaCter, from their prosession and manner of life; and, so far as this influence extends, it is of importance what diredionit takes. It must be owned, that there are some general prepoffiefions againft the clerical profeifion, as unfavourable to certain amiable and manly qualities, and as giving so deep a'tindure to the very virtues that belong to it, that the piety of churchmen is believed toborder on hypocrify, their morals on austerity, their learning on pedantry, and their zeal for religion aid the good of mankind to be, for the molt part, assumed as a pretence to aid or to cover their pride and ambition. But 1 am of opinion, that the tendency of the coniiitution of our CI-IU RCH, not only obviates theie general objections, but also that it has force enough to form a very refpedable character;
and, in particular, that admitting ibme few peculiar disadvantages to which her mmniiters are liable, there are not, on the whole, many orders of men, and no clergymen of any denomination, whoie functions and manner of life are better suited than theirs to produce a spirit of independency, or to exercise and strengthen some of the best faculties and afediions of the mind.

IF it be true, that it belongs to the righ trous, and the free, to be bold as a lion, the miniLter of this c H U R C H muf derive forti;tde and elevation of mind from the causes already mentioned. His very manner of obtaining a living, never by purchase, feldom by personal application; the consciousness of being well-qualified for the office, after having had his abiiities and morals everely tried; together with that equality oi rank with the fathers of the CH RCH, to xwhich he is at oace admitted; tend, in the beginning, to inspire him with manly and generous sentiments: and the natural effed of the paforal employment, in which he is afterwards ,engaged,, is to raise, and not depress the spirit. He has made choice of a profe-ion lwhicih, though not opulent, is liberal ; he has entered into a ltate which, though not improvcable, is independent.
W -ithout the habits that contradc the heart, without lthe views that enslave the mind, the member of this CHURCH therefore refts his hopes, in this world, on personal diftindions alone; on his talents, his learning, or his virtue.

IN other churches, the great power and wealth of dignified clergymen, no doubt, throw a splendor on the whole body, and may often be strong incentives to a noble and manly ambition: but as they leave the bulk of the order at so great a distance, and make preferment a constant objec of attention, it may be questioned, how far they are favourable to some of the belt qualities of the mind. In our CHURCH, equality of rank, whatever inconveniencies may otherwife attend it, effectually prevents the growth of some kind of vices; for every one of her sons standing on the fame ground with another, looks neither down with faftidioufilefs, nor up with adulation.

THE part, besides, that every clergyman of this CH U RCH engages in, whenever he is ordained, not only to teach but to rule, must strengthen and invigorate the mind.


For though the objects may appear but small in comparison with the great affairs of civil government; yet the fame talents are exerted, the fame affections and paflions are exercifed, the fame powers and energies of mind are employed in church-courts as in others.
And in the freedom ofdebate, in the bustle of popular assemblies, in all applications to men, force and spirit are improved more than in any other exercise; and the faculties of the foul are not only whetted, but enlarged. It is more than probable, that our situation will ever prevent us from excelling in elegance of behaviour, in poliihed manners, orin graceful accomplishments; nor is it of much importance that we mhould. But if we do not attain those better qualities, that enable a man to adt a vigorous and independent part, whenever his own opinions and affections, or the public good, {hall engage him, we are without excuse; for no churclhmen were ever placed in a fituation of more advantage for acquiring them.
We stand at present, as I apprehend, diftinguiled, as a body of men, for some of the qualties I have mentioned. Piety, good morals, and fidelity in his office, are indifpenfible in a minister; but without a free and independent mind, he will want one of the best and most effectual guards to his virtues, AN eminent author has ascribed certain peculiar vices to the clergy, which, he fays, are derived from their profession and manner of life, in so much as to justify, in a great degree, the trite maxim, that " priests " of all religions are the fame," and tend naturally to destroy the candour and ingenuity of their tempers, to render their probity for the most part suspicious, and to make them dangerous to civil government.
Now as these reflections coincide but too much with the prepossessions of many, and as religion itself may susser by such imputations upon her ministers. it will not be improper to hew, that this charge does not apply to the members of this CHURCH, and that our constitution itself obviates these general objetions.

THE charaderiftical vices of clergymen, that he chiefly dwells upon, are hypocriiy, ambition, and pride. "To hypocrisy," he al ledges, " they are inclined; because, being drawn from the common mass of mankind, they will either have no great turn "for devotion; or, were they ever so good, "to support the character of their profef"sion, and to impose upon mankind, they " must appear to be fiill better than they "are." But our CHURCH is so happily conflituted, that this objection does not apply to her members.

FOR admitting that the restraints of difci pline might give check to the natural charadcer, were they to operate alone; yet, when they are counteracted by the principles of freedom and the spirit of independency, which I have flewn to belong in a remarkable manner to the miiifters ofthis CHURCH, they cannot possibly overpower the candour and ingenuity of the mind. Our republican form of goverment, which exposes every man's character and conduct to be nearly inspected by his equals ; our contentions in church-courts, where our talents and passions are fuficiently employed ; prevent both the inclination and the power of imposing a feigned feigned character on the public. Our early and constant intercourse with the world, our daily communications with our people, the simplicity of our worship, and, perhaps, even the flight distinction ofdrefs between us and other men, are all circumstances that disqualify us for acting the part of impoftors.

NOR is this all: For if artifice and disguise were attempted, they would now meet with buta cold reception. Superfition and monachifm having been long banished from PROTE S T A N T churches,the characer of a clergyman that is most beloved and respected amongft us, is that which is most amiable and respectable. The arts of popularity may, no doubt, sometimes be tried, and particular prejudices and weaknesses of the people may be applied to: but these arts cannot long be successful. The other parts of a man's conduct that are inconsistent with his arts and his pretences, being exposed to the near infpection of familiarity, and the vigilance of rivalfliip, will soon betray or detect his real character. Popular virtues only, can al D ways ways retain the love and esteem of the people.
An unfeigned piety, a tender humanity, diligence in the paltoral office, integrity and candour, liberality of mind, steadiness of conduc, uniformity of zeal; these are the qualities that render a man a popular and refpeciable minifler of this CH URCH. And there, I hope, we do not in general need to feign, to please our people, or impose uponmankind.

WITH as little force can the charge of ambition, in the fene he means, be brought against the ministers of this CHURCH.

HE alledges, " That,while the ambition of other men is commonly satisfied by excel " ling in their particular profession, and " thereby promoting the interests of focie"ty, the ambition of the clergy can only be satisfied by promoting ignorance and " fuperfition, and implicit faith, and pious ' frauds : and having got, what Archime"des only wanted, (viz. another world on " which to fix his engines), no wonder they move this world at their plcafure ; which "being "being added to the close union of intereits "that takes place among clergymen of the " fame religion, makes them extremely for"midable to society."

How much soever such objeAions may apply to the priests of the church of ROME, whose hearts are hardened, by celibacy, to the interests of society, there is no PROTESTANT church against whom they can justly be laid. And with refpedt to the CHURCH of SCOTLAND, nothing can be more soreign to her constitution, or to the spirit and practice of her members. For, to cure the jealousy of the state, fle has admitted to a parity of rule with her ministers, the order of lay-elders, who are incorporated in all her judicatories in such numbers, as to be effectual guardians of the interefis of society, against every poflible combination of the clergy. And as I have already observed, that we could not impose on the people, were we ever so much inclined to it; I must add, that every clergyman, being a member of the great community of BRITAIN, which involves in it the interests of religion and liberty, as well as of our particular CHURCH, D 2 the the private corporation-fpiritis thereby couri°
teradced and controlled, so that it can never be dangerous to society. And to this great public we are bound, not by our principles alone, but by one of the strongest assertions of the human mindj the love of our families and children.

IF the charge of pride and obstinacy, when laid against the members of this H U CR H is not already fully answered by what has been said concerning the two preceding objeeions, lee it be farther observed, that mens minds are wonderfully softened since toleration was eftablilied; for fecdaries having no longer the power of hurting each other, their animofities are in a greatmeafure at an end. And let me add, that our c H R c in particular, guards against there vices, by the equal power of its members, as rulers in a free and independent community, where pretence and authority have no effect, and nothing but reason and superior powers of periuafion can prevail.

THUS THUS have I endeavoured to liew the ten dency of our ecelefiaftical constitution to form the temper, spirit, and character of its members: or, in other words, 1 have marked the towers, bulwarks, and palaces of our Zion; which' though not sumptuous and costly edifices, yet are founded deep, and are well-calculated for strength and duration.
But they are not perfect so far as they are human, like all things else, they are liable to defects a few of which I beg leave to point out, before I conclude, that we may Ikilfully bend our endeavours to support our JERUSALEM where she is weak, and to repair her where she has fallen into decay.

THE sirs 'defect I shall mention, is in the very fabric of our constitution itself;
which intrusts the fame bodywith the higheft judicative and executive powers, and even with great part of the legislative too: A combination that, in some cafes, would be extremely dangerous ; and, even in our cafe, is attended with this inconvenience, that our courts, in their judicative capacity, may Sometimes decide on general expediency, ra ther L 32 1 ther than particular laws; and with the temper of judges, less than the spirit of legiflators. Hence it is, that partiality and injustice may be exercised, the innocent may be condemned, and the guilty may be acquitted. One compensation or balance, however, there is to this defec in our conflitution, which is this, that the supreme power is not lodged in a permanent body, but in a court ofreprefentatives chosen every year; and who being themselves the peers of all those who are tried before them, are not likely to be either able, or willing, to persist in any plan of oppression or injustice.

Afecond defect is a certain consequence of our republican constitution, which makes us liable to faction and party-fpirit.

AN evil no doubt fraught with many breaches of charity, and with much alienation of mens mind from each other. For men who set out with the firm belief that they are promoting public good, and serving the great ends 6f virtue and religion, and who are countenanced and confirmed by their their associates in this opinion, are apt, when aching in a party, to go lengths, of which, in other situations, they would be utterly a{hamed. Hence the liberty that is taken of making truth and conscience to be only of one fide; of branding each other with the names of LIBERTINE, and HYPOCRITE ;
of magnifying an indecorum into a crime, or of conitruing a revere or morose demeanour to be vile grimace; while the enemies of our C H U R c H lie in wait for such fair opportunities of seducing the credulous from every fide, and the foes of all religion fit in the scorner's chair and laugh.

TH I s evil, which calls for the attention of all men of worth and virtue to mitigate and assuage its more violent symptoms, is however the genuine product of our conflitution; and as long as we are free and independent, and, at the fame time, imperfect creatures, can never be wholly cured. But it is happily controlled in its most pernicious effects, by the broad basis of our fupreme court, which brings members from every corner, uninfected with each others local local passions; and by the institution of el?
ders: an order not only most wifely calculaed to promote religion and good morals among the people, and reconcile them to the discipline of the CHURCH ; but also to unite us more closely with the commonwealth, to.
prevent the jealousy of government, to guard against the encroachments of ecclefiaftical power, and to abate the ferment of minds sometimes overheated with partyzeal and itrife.

THE third and laj1 defect that I fiall men.

tion, is the incompetent provision for tile clergy: a defecL that I do not unjuilly ascribe to the conflitution; which was formed on a surrender 6f the patrimony of the church, and all temporal power and dominion, with entire reliance for its support on the sense which the public should have of its utidli. Tlis is an evil not only severely felt by the miniftcrs of this establishment.
(who. I am bold to f-v. would :io, diihonour ar.- focicty upon earth), but of che m:-s tLreaLening asped on the CHURCH ; since It -ay soon fill her with persons of inferior birth and mean education, to the ruin of learning, learning and religion too: an evil, however, that we cannot justly impute, in all its extent, to the illiberal spirit of the generations that are past, since they could not possibly foresee the rapid progress of commerce; otherwife, it is probable, they would have fixed on such a kind of provision for the clergy, as would have risen, in some proportion, to the prosperity of the country, and not fallen in its value every day.

WHAT we may hope for from this fplen did age, so fertile in grand and magnificent projecs, is beyond my conjecture. But if the CHURCH of SCOTLAND is such as I have represented her to be, of so much utility, and of so little danger to the public, her falling Rate, in this refpet, will one day become an objed to Legislature itself: and men, capable of great and extensive views, will fee that, by preserving our CHURCH in her vigour, they will execute a work truly worthy of themselves ; they will strengthen one pillar of religion and liberty that is in danger of decay, and help to prolong the period of light and happiness to mankind.

~E ~BUT, But, my Reverend FATHERS and BRE THREN, tho' this defect in our constitution is a subjed of anxiety and regret, and of uneasy forebodings, we need not yet fall into defpair. There are some considerations that serve, for the present, to extenuate this evil, and from which we may derive a temporary comfort, MA 1Y we not hope for a partial, at least, and gradual redress of this evil, from the wisdom and attention of our own Supreme Court of Law, f .ar as our i-tation is intrusted to their care ? Have not many minifters of this CHURCH already experienced,what iult slntimersr that learnedand venerable bod- entertain 6f the narrow allowance made for them, when compared with the flourifiling itare o this couniry Though the provision for the clergy has fallen very much in its value: -zr Is not their rank, in some resied, railed; not on:l b, the removal of cel ain political prejudices, which separated them f2rom many of fperior order; but also by the ri' of aii orders or men beneath them, throuhal tihe impro-vements of industry, and the incri.ai oGf w-eath ' \hat advantage may flay not be gained, from the clergy's having become the chief depofitaries of general learning, now that the attention and efforts of almost all other men are devoted to commerce alone ? Do not our universities borrow many of their fairest ornaments from the CHURCH? And what glory may not be won in that field of diftindtion so lately opened to the learned of this country, I mean, composition, and the art of writing; where the whole range of science is before them, where there are laurels enough to satisfy the most ardent ambitionofpliterary fame It is here, ye sising hopes of our JER U AL E M my younger friends, who are still candidates for the ministry, who have forsaken all to follow this ungainful profeflion; it is here that you must look for your rewards in this world. Here you will find obje&s suited to your taftes; here you will perceive a Ihining path to reputation, that will answer the defire of your hearts : For admiration is the passion of young and generous minds; and the love of diflinaion is predominant with the youth of genius, far above the love of wealth. It were indeed happy, if, by our E 2 re regulzatons and our own concduc, we could make it a mark of diatinclion to be admitted of our order.

IT might now be expected that I should address mrnfelf to the reft of my audience, and offer rome apology to them for having made, what they may think, an encomium on my own order; an encomium to which they may alledge they are bound to pay but little regard. All that I {hall fay is, that an njuft panegyric is the severest satire. But if the view 1 have given of the constitution of this c H r C H be true, I have not improperly followed the Psalmist's advice, to -ialk about Z-clz, to tell her towers, to mark well her bulwarks. a.nd conjider her palaces, that ye ;.I' tell it to the generatil.i following; that -vcu may impress on your own minds a sense of the excellent churchl-government you are under, and may inculcate on your children and rofterity a just efteerm ofthofe whooha.v the charge of your foulsj who have 4ot doii-=
sii; over your lfaith, but are helpers of your joyr LET us then join together in fervent prayer to to the KING and HEAD of his CHURCH, *who hath not only fenced her with towers and with bulwarks, and adorned her with palaces, but hath made her all glorious within, that he would bless all his own divine inflitutions, to the salvation of men, and the glory of his kingdom; and that whatever he hath left us to devise for the fake of peace and good order, may, through him who alone infpireth with wisdom, conduce to the fame great ends that our Jerusalem may always have prosperity, and that the gates of hell jmay never prevail agaijl her.
