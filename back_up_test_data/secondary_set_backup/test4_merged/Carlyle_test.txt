USEFULNESS AND NECESSITY OF A LIBERAL EDUCATION FOR CLERGYMEN, A SERMON A SERMON MAT. V. 14.

Ye are the light of the world, SURPRISING as it may seem to be, there have been some who have thought, that a learned education was not necessary for Ministers of the Gospel. Nor has this been the opinion of enthusiasts alone; for not a few of the fober minded and truly pious, have not been able to fee the utility of the accompliflments of learning to a Chriifian pallor. And even in our own days, it has been roundly asserted, " That " polite literature and elegant erudition A " are " are of no use to a clergyman, in the exL ercife of his ministerial duties; and that C they by no means enter, as an esential < ingredient, into his pastoral charaCter."

One would have imagined, that the slightest view of the nature of the office, might hlve checked the rife of such ideas; for the Chriflian paflor has united in one, what was divided into two among the Gentiles and Jews. The pontiff and the philosopher, the priest and the prophet of those religions, form but one character in the Minister of the Golpel;
who not only presides in the sacred rites of our holy religion; but is likewise the teacher of its doctrines and precepts. Attention to the progress of Christianity might have prevented this error: For though the twelve apoflles of our Lord were chofcn from among the rude and illiterate, to prevent suspicion of imposture, while the attestation of facds was the principal obj et; yet, when the Christian faith was to be cxtended beyond the bounds of Judea, Judea, the wifdorn of that Spirit, which presided over the propagation of the gofpel made choice of St. Paul for that important work, a man bred at the feet of Ga~
maliel; that is, trained up in all the learning of the Jews, and likewisfe well acquainted with the language and philofophy of the Greeks; as appears from his writings. The very intlitutions of our own church, when adverted to, may serve to correc so abfard an idea; for they have very anxiously guarded against the ignorance of clergymen, no lets, than against their immorality, by the long course of fludy they have prescribed to intrants, and thoie ftrid, and painful, and various pieces of trial, which they have ordained thern to undergo, before they can be admitted into holy orders.

But as, nctwitlhfanding all tlhei argu ments, there are flill Ibme who look back for an example to the firfi age. hecdiefs of the different rfares of the church, and of the world; and as uneducated pret:ndcrs A a are are too apt to catch the vulgar, I propose in this discourse, with the blesing of God, to hsew the usefulness and necessity of a liberal education for clergymen ; which if 1 am able to do, I shall illustrate one of the primary objects of this most beneficent and liberal inflitution. I fliall then, I. Endeavour briefly to draw the out line of that education which befits a clergyman; or flhew, wherein a liberal education may be supposed to consist.

II. I shall endeavour to shew the great advantages of such an educacion.

II. I fliall make application of the sub jc(c to this Society; who I hope will forgive me, if, emboldened by the duty they have afligned me, and presuming too much perhaps on my age and experience, I fiall offer inftrution to their enllightned minds.

I. I am to point out wherein a liberal education may be said to consist; or draw the the outlines of that plan of inftrucltion that befits a clergyman.

It has often of late been the subjeC of doubt, whether or not the time that is spent in early youth, with so much labour and pains, to acquire the knowledge of the dead languages, is necessary in modern times, or is ever repaid by any equivalent advantages. But however plausible the arguments may be, against this unneceffary waste of time as it is called, in some other lines of life, yet they cannot poffibly be applied with justice to any of the learned profeflions, especially to that of the divine: For the sacred books having been written in these languages, it would be unpardonable ignorance in the candidate for our profefllon, to be unacquainted with them, or to be unable to study all that is comprehended in the wide compass of biblical knowledge. Or how are the sublime beauties of Scripture, from whence so much internal evidence is derived, and which is the sacred armou ry ry for the weapons of our warfare, to be felt or underflood, if the student is ignorant ol or a mere novice in, the languages in which they are written ! To be firmly eftabliflied himself in the belief of the f:crptures, and to be able to communicate the foundations of that belief, in a clear and convincing manner ; and still more, to have a decided taste for those lofty firains of the sublime and the pathetic, which captivate the foul of man, and make his bowels to yearn within him, the Chrif-ian teacher surely ought to be a mafter of the original languages.

Add to this, that the classics in two of the ancient tongues, have been handed down to us, with the contenting voice of every age, as the mofi perfect models of composition; as the highefl efforts of human genius; as exhibiting examples of good sense and taste; and even such glowing pictures of virtue, as are congenial to the young and feeling mind, and make a more lasting irnpielion, than can be clone by by formal rules. No wonder then that clafical learning fliould be conrfdered as an essential branch of a liberal educat;.,n.
So far flould we be fi-om laying afidc the antients for tlhe moderns, and abridging the labour of a learned education, that if there is any defect to be correctedl in ours, it is that the youth are hurried too Lilt into science, before they have had time or maturity enough, to acquire perf:el 11 ill in thl;fe languages, or to imbibe part of that spirit, to catch fonie portion of that celcftial fire of benius, with w'lichl thefc fupcrior writings are composeld.

And if our pupil ought to be a mafrer of the claflics, it follows of course, that he mufr be conversant in criticifin and rhetoric, and every branch of the belles lettres, that he n.ay fully co.n!pre: end the beauty and lublimity of anticnt conpofition. I-ere it must be obfirsved tlhat our vernacular tongue mufu not be negleted.
It was perhaps, by means of their close attention to the study of their own lan guagcs, guages, that the Greeks and Romans attained to that degree of perfection in them, which has made their writings of all kinds the admiration and the models of succeeding ages. We in particular, who speak and write a provincial dialedc of the national tongue, that not long ago was hardly understood in the capital, had much need to apply with the utmost diligence in early youth to acquire the pure idiom of that language in which we speak and write; because, in more advanced years. it will not only be a more difficult acquisition, but may retain an inaccuracy, or a stiffness at least, which are the marks of imperfection.

When this branch of erudition is finifil ed, or towards its conclusion, it will be proper to initiate our student in logic and the elements of mathematics, as not only neceffary to exercise his mind in close reasoning, and thereby to fhrengthen and improve his faculties, but to enable him to comprehend the sublime science of natural philosophy in all its parts, when it is opened ripened up to his admiring mind: and cf;eciay those which in tracing the wonderful effects of power, wisdom and goodness in the diversified fTiame of nature, lead direily with the mnoic f)lendid demonfiration to the firit Cauie, that supreme Intelligence which created and prelides over tlhe whole.

Thus prepared, with his mind expand ed to explore the works of God, our pupil may venture to look within htlilelf; to fludy the fcicnce of mind or spirit; to invefligate the inteilectual, the ;iive, and moral powers of man, the molt mytlcrious and diflicult of all the sciences; that withl faculties enlarged, and more infallible lagacity, he may be able to search to the bottom the principles of ethics and politics, as they are dif;tlayed with iuch boundless divcrfity, in the hiIfory of man either as an individual or in society.

And now, well able to diflinguifh between truth and faliehood, between cer B tainty tainty and doubt, and to mark the line that divides their boundaries, he may venture to explore the sublime regions of Theology, to trace what is comprehensible by finite, in infinite Mind; to perceive the connexion between the visible and invisible world; to deduce natural and revealed religion from the fame source; and, in the hiflory of man and his moral agency in this life, to descry his future destiny in the next.

And here commences our student's most arduous tafki, for which all the other parts of his education are chiefly preparatory; I mean the study of Theological Learning.
To this he must for several years of his maturer age, devote his molt serious attention and assiduous labour; for it is from the inftruc'ion he shall receive, and the knowledge he shall acquire, in this important course, that he can be properly furnished for the defence of revealed religion, and for the refutation of sceptical cavils: that he can become thoroughly ma fter fter of the history and doCtrines of the Reformation, and be able to establish the great principles of Christian faith, againfl all heretical opinions. ltowfoever great a proficient our pupil may be in classical knowledge, or however much an adept in philosophy, yet, if he is deficient in theological erudition, he will fall short of what is expected in his profession, his proper work will be always laborious to him, and a degree of llightnefs will be attached to his character as a divine, which may derogate from his usefulness. But on this part of education, though in itself so important, I need not enlarge, as its necefity is so obvious and inconteftible; but shall proceed to mention others that may be overlooked.

Of these let me recommend as a branch of politics, the constitution and laws of his country, as a most necefary part of his fludy. It were well too, if to the general knowledge of human nature, our pupil could add some kl?,noleode of the world; that which terminates in felfifhnefs and cunning, nor that which may qualify him to be a ringlea(ler in the vices of the age, but that kno!ledge of the world wrhich is so needful to induce politeness of behaviour, and thole agreeable manners, which taking rife in benevolence and charity, mufL nevcrthe!if receive their form fr-om the practice of iociety, fiomi converIation and habits w;th the elegant and :cfined.

In antient phraseology, the scholar and the ,gentlelnlan were fy'noniiious terms, an(d were confidered as inflparalle. In nodccrn language, this has fbmctilmes bcen unfortunately changed, for th'e Lnalme of gentleman las IcenC as nmuci a terml of obloquy amongl; the rl.vc as that of pedant 1-s been of contempt among the gay; by .which means the bad qualities only of eachI, have been generally annexed to the characers, and a gentleman by the multitude has too often been underiood to be -menrely a pcri.n illivterat, idle, and mif cll.evous, \ '3 )

chievous; and a pedant acknowledged to be learned, and heavy, and rude. This Li:t charaecr on account of a variety of circumstances was long ascribed to the clergy of this church, and they were then not unjustly afraid of the appellation of gentlemen, as with the unthinking vulgar of all ranks, that implied licentious man elers.

It is high time to change this perversion of words and ideas ; and the change is bcgun: for an accomplilhed gentleman is now underflood to mean evcry thing praifc-worthy in a characecr, to comprehernd all the qualities that attracd the eflecrl, or attach the afTeEions of mankind, learning and virtue, agreeable talcnts and poii!ice:
manners. And the opinion of .lC public, no longer reflrainetd by Gothic nanners and the exclusive cl:imns of the iipicrior orders, but equal and free as their laws, is 'now ready to give every man his due, in proportion to t :' val:eC oj his talents and accomplishments.

To'


To make the world of easier access to our fludent than it formerly was, the virtues and vices have resumed their places again, after having been long deranged by the disorderly hands of superstition and cnthufiafm. It is no longer a crime to be well-bred, nor ridiculous to be learned.
The amusements of the gay are not held to be profane, nor the fludies of the grave to be absurd or useless. The muses have replaced the graces in their train, and recovered their wonted attractions. But if hypocrisy has pulled off her disguise, and the catalogue of fins extends no farther now than to things prohibited by the law and the gospel, surely the more liberty the manners of the age allows our fludent in things lawful or indifferent, so much less temptation has he to overleap the bounds of 'wJhat is rbiddenz, and follow fashionable dissipation; so much the stronger inducemment, to preserve that professional decorum which becomes his dignity. But why should I dwell longer on this imperted delineation ? The luminous method of intlruction inf-rution, prescribed in our universities, and executed with so much honour and success, is a far better guide than any imperfect sketch of mine can be. What I mean to inculcate is this, That the line of education for clergymen, cannot be too extensive or liberal, and that of the three learned professions, ours can least admit of a limited or narrow fyflem of inftruction.

The profession of the law, though on many accounts the leading profession in this country, is not necessarily conversant in any but outward things, the property of man, and the restraints of law on his actions. The study of the law and its accessories, is therefore all that is necefiary in this laborious profession. T he fame thing may be said of the medical art, whose object is the bodies of men. But the bufiness of those of the clerical profeflion, is with the mind of man, and therefore their preparatory knowledge is of the most boundless extent, embracing the whole circle of science, .iience, all the objecs and operations of intelle2c, and all the objects and motions of the will and the paflions; for each and every one of them, m.ay occasionally serve as useful inflruments in the Chri/lian orator's vocation; which is, by enlightning the minds, and purifying the paflions of men, to make them wife and virtuous and happy. 'c are the light of the worlJi Add to this, that the operations and es fcds of the two other profefions are at ian end and cease forever, rwhen the tenure of all earthly goods is cancelled by the hand of death, and when the body is laid in the grave; but those of the Christian philofbpher, while they tend to make the rich man haplpy n b7c'nevolence, and the poor serene and contenltd tvith hope, and the sick and .fflictcl patient -nnmarnanin-tius through faith, even in this life, provide for them all in the life to come, zwhat 'ye has not feel;, nor ea eard, wvhat it hath not entered into the lheart of mian to conceive,.

But I come Iln In the second place to point out the great advantages of such an education; and here i shall be confined to three particulars, as it refpeds a clergyman's personal characler; as it refpeds his fitness for the office; as it may prove ornamental to the society.

_si, I shall confider the advantage of a liberal education,as it reipeds a clergyman's personal character.

Mankind may be divided into the edu cated and uneducated, learned and ignorant, wife and foolifil; and it is obvious to which division the preference must be given. For though it does not neceflarily follow, that all the learned are wife, and all the ignorant foolifhl; yet, in the opinion of mankind, there is a marked fiperiority attached to theformer. 'Tej7all be as Gods, said Satan to our firit parents, 7,when7 he temptedthem to ta/le of the tree of knowledge. Riches and poverty, the moit obvious of all divisions, mark the lines of C powerC power and of dependance; but for refpe&
and authority in all the important affairs of life, for advice in perplexity, for counfel in danger, for every office of weight and confidc'-tion in human society, the advantages of a liberal education have ever been acknowledged. /[ hen the city is befieged, the izvfe man is rev oted to, even though he Jhould be psor. Eccles.

In the common intercourse of life, the educated man must every moment feel the superiority he polfeiTes, not in the outward marks of respect, which are frequently denied him, but in the ascendant he perceivcs he has over the minds of other men, the mot flattering of all the qualities and talents a man can pollefs ; becaufl it is derived fromn no foreign circumilance, but solely from peroinal merit; because it is the homage which nature has prefcribed the weak in intellect shall pay to the strong. It has sometimes been questioned whether or not the mofl consummate general, the hero in war, in common opi nion nion the most splendid of all characters, ought to be accounted of talents superior to the philosopher who enlightens the world ? Of their comparative usefulness to mankind there has been no doubt: Could the queflion be solved by the temper and conduct of kings and heroes themselves, it would be decided in favour of the latter; for we shall find that they have not always been satisfied with the fulness of their own qualities and glory, but have often languished on their thrones, for that kind of celebrity which belongs to the works of fages and philosophers. Not contented that their actions were to fill the hi/foric page, and their renown to animate the poet's lays, they have foinetimes firove, with vain emulation, to excel them in their several arts.

But not only in public opinion, but in his own felf-government, is that strength of character which is derived from a liberal education of the greatest advantage to a minister of this church. 'Tis in his C 2 conscious conscious superiority of wifdorn and vir, tue, that he is able to maintain his dignity, in that nice and difficult situation in which he is placed. To mix daily with the people, and yet be uninfeted with their manners; to hold the middle course, between the aufRerity that difgufls, and the facility that breeds contempt; to have all the nice feelings of an elegant and enlightned mind, and yet to bear the shocks to which it is liable, and be denied moit of the gratifications for which it creates a taste. To be contfantly firiving with narrow circumstances in the midlt of a commercial slate without hope of improving them, and yet to preserve equanimity, and maintain a dignity of conduC, sufficient to draw the respect that is due to his ftation:-Thefe are parts of that arduous undertaking, which ministers engage in, when they enter into this church ; which never could be sustained, but for that elevation of mind and force of character, which is acquired by a liberal education.

'Tis 'Tis by this means that he is felf-fatisfied, even in the midst of the most trying circumftances that can befal him; that reposing himself on the enjoyments of a philofophic mind, he can calmly bear the neglet, or even the contumely of the world;
and, retiring to contemplation and solitude, can content himself with the consolations of learning, the exercises of piety, and the duties of his charge.

A 2d advantage arising from the liberal education of clergymen, is, that it fits them for their profession.

Personal merit in some degree qualifies a man for every thing; and he who brings a strenuous, an elevated, and enlarged mind into any profession, is most likely to shine in it. Yet there is a certain meetnefs and fitness of talents and profeflions for each other, without which excellency cannot be attained.

It was taught by the ancients that the good good and virtuous man alone was qualisied to fline as an orator in their public afifenblies. How much more clearly must it be understood, that he who is to teach virtue to others, mufl hinmfelf be eminently virtuous; thathe who is to inftrud mankind in knowledge, must himnfelf be fully inftru ded ? Both are the fruits of a liberal education; and both are necefliry in the clerical profession. For though proof susficient to convince the hearers of any truth may be at the command of the intelligent;
yet the power of asseting the passions of men, and of conveying irrefiflable and lasting impressions of morality to their minds, belongs only to him, who to superior knowledge, joins the virtues of ths heart. And though learning and virtue are not infeparable companions, yet who so likely to acquire that divine quality, or to improve it, when already bestowed by thefframerof the human foul, as the man who having trod the whole circle of science, with enlarged views, has discovered what is good and ihat is evil; what we ought to seek after, after, and to lihun; how contemptible alloutward things are; and that the dignity and happiness of human nature confilRs in the exercise of its talents and virtues? For the pious and virtuous man, whose mind is enlarged and invigorated by the moll extensive range of knowledge, as he must have nobler views of all the objedts of piety and virtue than others, cannot fail to possess all the feelings that belong to them with greater poignancy, and perform all their ads with greater energy, than can be done by the untaught and illiterate.

As the clergyman's profe.lion is the only one that is entirely set aside and devoted to the service of mankind, he had much need to have. a double portion of difintereflednefs, and thelove of his species; neither of which can be acquired without that high nobility of foul, and ample capacity of heart, which is the portion of thole who are deeply conversant with all the liberal arts and sciences, and have the most intimate knowledge of the hiitory of man.

And And yet the first is necessary to make his labours acceptable and efficacious among those for whom they are employed; and the second is necefary to make them easy and pleating to himself.

But besides the general fitness for his important office, which is the fruit of a liberal education, there are particular parts of it, for which our candidate could not be tolerably well qualified, without this previous course of erudition. The inftruction of the young or ignorant, for instance, the visitation of the sick, the giving advice to the perplexed, comfort to the afflited, rebuke to the profligate, which are his daily ministrations, how could they be performed, confidering the infinite variety of characters, unless the Christian pastor perfecly understood the intricate ftruture of the human mind, knew all its fecretreceffes, and subtle wiles, all the springs of the passions and motives of action But farther, when we confider his func tion tion as a Chrifian orator, in what point can it be viewed, in which the advantages of a liberal education are not strikingly manifest? In the course of his tniniflrations there is almost no fuibjec on which he may not have occasion to ipeak Univerfal knowledge must then be ever at his command; since he cannot speak to advantage of what he does not thoroughly know.

I-s intimate acquaintance with t'-:e holy scriptures, which contain tlh fyife:ni of docbtines, and the code of laws to which he niuil confiantly appeal, widch are full of examples both of a public and private nature, and are particularly enriched witil the gofiel of our Lord, the history of his life and death, and the propagation of our faitll; the lknowledge of thefc alone, Inuft ultimately prove a rich provision fur the Chriflian teacher: for it is chiefly to facilitate his just and accurate discernment ds the sense and design of those books, that he has made iuch a laborious preparation.

D His His knowledge of the art of reasoning will enable our intrant into holy orders, to define and to prove with accuracy, and to unravel all the intricacies of sophistry.
His fikill in rhetoric will teach him to form his orations in such a manner, as best to answer the purpose of eloquence, which is persuasion. His being an adept in the fcience of ethics, his perfecA acquaintance with the ftrucuure of the human mind, will dire: him to point the scope of his difcourses, so as to sway the passions of men, the Iprings of their condut1. History will furnifli him with fads and illustrations:
and even poetry itself will be subservient to his purpose ; because a great part of scripture is poetical, and because the lofty diction and figures of poetry have a near relation to those of oratory.

In short, the mind of the Christian teacher being fully stored with all forts of knowledge befbre he begins to compose or speak, it will not be difficult for him to be a mafter in his art, Without this original fund of science, even considerable talents will prove deficient, and genius itfelffeem barren and deserted. The most painful preparation will produce discourses meagre and jejune, or at belt splendid patchwork of ill-conforted parts. Whereas they who have laid up in store an ample fund of many years preparation, can at all times, without any seeming effort, fend forth fi-om their neverfailing fountain of knowledge, such copious fireams, as flaall enrich and fertilize wherever they flow.

But not only does this general prepara tion of our Christian orator render easy and effectual his daily labours; but every part of a liberal education is occasionally of very particular advantage to a minister.
I flall give an instance or two of such as appear motl problematical.

Of what use, it may be said, is the know ledge of the world, and elegant accompliflhments to a clergyman ? They are not neceflary in the exercise of his vocation; and they they tend rather to raise aversion in the lower orier-:, and to excite ridicule in the higher. But this objeclion is taken from what is too often to be seen, the (aIe&'ation ,of those qualities, and not the reality. ior the true knowlcdge of the woorld, and genuMilne accolmplifhn-icnts, must always appca. in o f imple a form, as nor to oilend, but to conciliate. They are a crown and ornament to all other talents and qualities, andt these lead the pofieifor ro produce them with such moodeft propriety as to overcome the molt pr-judiced. The preacher of rz-h.'eou/ncl/s inuft: be converfimnt witi imen of all ranks, if polilble to goain their rcfpect and good will, and reconcile therr to the truth: and that kind of dceeanour is ikcly to be motI l;iceisful, the prime quality of lwhich is, that it cannot cfend.

It is our0 duty at all times with our ut molt addrcfs, to draw the attention and(
countenance of the upper ranks of life ta the duties of religion ; and never was it Ynore io than at pirefent ; vwhen men's principles principles of every kind are afloat, and when the angel with his warning voice seems to proclaim, J.oe to the inhabitants on earth ! It is in the nature of man when he is in high prosperity to dread no reverse of fortune;
when the age he lives in is highly enlightned, to believe that an ara of darkness can never return. But we have only to look back into the annals of the world to be undeceived. Look back, did I/fy ? \Ve have only to look. at the present moment, to our neighbouring state, to be convinced that xras of indifference and fanaticii': , of infidelity and fiipe.flition, arc nor fb ditfant from each other as we apprehend.
And we ihould in such a slate, never cease to zwar-n with jlrongefq emphasis, those whom it chiefly concerns, that if they whos- situation entitles them to keep the teas, in the rational and manly, and most benevolent s{ystem of faith and worfilip which we now enjoy, fhiould negleed it; the tilne may be at hand, iz'.ten they u'ho in all things otzht to Jo.:/oi, may seize those reins which drop from feeble and indolent lhands, and realize realize again in this favoured isle, the fury and barbarity and darkness of former ages.

Of what use, it may be said, is political knowledge to a clergyman ? That teems entirely foreign to the duties of his function. And it must be confefled, that to make men pious and virtuous, through the knowledge of the truth as it is in Christ 7e/us, is the great objec of our ministry;
for sincere and faithful Christians will of course be good fubjedts, obedient to the laws, and refpedtful to magistrates. But bc.ldes that, it must be observed, that we are placed in the middle between the higher and lower ranks of men, and as an eftablilhed church, are entrusted by our country with the charge of forming the minds of our people, to a due sense of the bleffn.gs of that good government, which we lave fiorn to maintain and defend; to inftrudc them in the nature of their rights and privilcges, as well as their duties ; and create in them a reverence and attachment to that constitution by which they hold their their religion and liberty, and all that is dear to them. Besides this necelfary duty in peaceable times, a minifier of this church ought to be well enlightened, and firmly eflablifled indeed, in his pclitical principles, that he may be able to stand faF:
himself, and to confirm his flock on the rising of fJich low ring clouds of/edition, as of late threatened this guilty laind with universal ruin. Had the clergy been uninformed, or diaTfecreed, or even lukewarm on that occasion, God only knows what a dreadful storm we might have now been encountering! Blefed be his name ! who hath delivered ius: by who/e mercy it is, that the proud waters have not overwhelmed our Jouls !

A 3d advantage to be derived from the liberal education of clergymen is, that it may prove ornamental to the society.

Besides thecharacterof individuals, there are characters annexed to whole bodies of men which procure them the eiteem, or fix fix on them the contempt, of the world.
An ignorant or immoral clergy could not fail to be disregarded. Church courts that ihould be variable in their decisions, and inconsistent in their measures, could never acquire or deserve the confidence of the public. Let us be thankful that the members of our church are held in general to be as learned and pious, and virtuous and orderly, as any ecclesiastics in the world.
And our fulpreme court has justly obtaincd a due authority over the minds of the people, on account of the uniformity of its decrees, and the wisdom of its proceedings.

But amidst the luminous sphere of our ecclesiastical heaven, there are conflellations that furpats the reft of the stars in fplendor and beauty; which enlighten at once and adorn. VWhat branch of literature is there, in which fbme of the ministers of this church have not excelled ? What subjec of fine writing is there, in which they do not, as authors, stand in the foremofl ranks rank:, which is a prouder boast than all the wealth and splendor of a hierarchy?
time would fail me filould I attempt to enumerate the works of the members of this church, who have fticcefsfully endeavoured to enlighten the world in alnoft every branch of knowledge.

Not to mention treatises in defence of Christianity, or learned difiertations on facred criticifin, or eloquent illustrations of every branch of Chriatian dodtrine and morals, which more immediately belong to the clergy ;-Who are they who have wrote the most excellent hiflories antient and modern ? They are clergymen of this church*.
WVho have given the clearef delineation of the human undertlanding. and the molt ihblime system of ethics that the world has ever een ? They are clergymen of this church--. Who has written the best lyftern of rhetoric in our tongue, and exem E plified * I)rs Robertson, Ferguson, Watson, Henry.

Who have been and still are the nioft illultrious philosophers, mathematicians, and astronomers of their times, or have excelled in natural history. or have given the mofl useful leflons in agriculture, the first of all the necessary arts ? They have been clergymen of this church.

There were no end in displaying the laurels so juflly won by the members of our body. And were I to point out the sons of the clergy §, who fline as flars of the first magnitude in this contfellation of genius, which adorns our literary sphere, i might be supposed to excite envy perhaps, which I would anxiously shun;

the minds of this society, to prosecute with the ardour of hope, that most liberal design which they have so happily begun.

Thus it is that the liberal education of /

clergymen proves ornamental to the whole society, and fiupplies in some degree the want of wcalth and dignities. Hence, it is, that we are of some name in diitant regions, and that our order fleds some rays of glory on our native land. We are poor indeed, but we are rich in the best goods a church can poirefs, in the learning, the manners, and character of its members Ours. is a fplelndid poverty, it is the paupecrtas ;/cziida viUorium.

Thus have I fulfilled my purpose, which was to fihew the utefulnefs and necessity of a liberal education for clergymen.

Let it not be forgot however, that this education with all the advantages I have ascribed to it, must be underitood, as de riving riving all the good that attends it, fiom the blessing of God, and the influence of his grace. For, though this influence is generally confidered as chiefly applicable to virtue, and the power of leading holy lives, while we ascribe all other talents and accomplifliments bflely to ourselves and our own efforts, yet the least refection will lead us to arrange these also under the divine agency. In himz .we live, and move, and have our being, without exception, or limitation; and we Ihall find that in all ages and nations, any extraordinary fikill in the useful arts, or any excellent knowledge of the sciences, has been attributed to the immediate in!piration of God.

I have only now in the third place, to make application of what I have said to this Society.

Is it then true, that a liberal education, in the moit extensive sense, is of the greateit adcvatage to the clergy of this church ?

I'Then Then may I congratulate and extol this society, for having undertaken a wct-k,, that may ultimately prove of so much utility to our country. For, although your views are not limited to a tingle profeiioln, yet, the families of clergymen, having been long the most fruitful femiinaries ol the church, it is not improbable that Ihe may chiefly reap the benefit of your benevolence and care. For alas ! without your sOftering hand, how few of them will, in future, be able to procure even that education which the rules of the church so wifly require !

When the Presbyterian church escaped fiom the hand of periecution, and was reitored to the willes of the people of this country at the revolution, she partook of the narrow principles and illiberal spirit, whlich pervaded the minds of men in that tumultuous age. The sudden demand for candidates to fill up every charge, obliged her to receive many, whu were but half educated, of low habits and vulgar manners. Popular elecions continued for some some time to prolong the evil, and the clergy were neglcted, if not defiifed by the superior orders. At length, the intrants of the church, having been relieved from the fear of being reje&ced, for those very qualities that adhere to a liberal education, began to avail themselves of their acquired talents and accomplishments. Among the firif, was that dif tinguifiled person, * who for so lor.g a period, filled the place where I now stand, who ventured to leave the beaten trat of dry fcholaflic preaching, and enforced the morality of the gofj-el as well as its doctrines, with much ability and elocution.
'I'his Tillotfon of the church of Scotland, as he has been called, was followed, and even excelled by some of his juniors, in the art of composition and eloquence, which he lived to fee and to rejoice in, with the mort cordial exultation.

' hen began that aira of ability and genius, which I have already mentioned, wherein 'L Dr George Wifhart.


wherein so many members of this church have diftinguiihed thicmnfelves in the annals of literature, and almoit every individual in his ieveral sphere, has displayed the effefts of a liberal and learned education. How happy is it for those, far in the vale of years, who have so long sustained the honour and dignity of their profession, whose evening was clouded with the forebodings of the falling slate of the church, that they can now look with glad presage, to this most benevolent and generous inflitution, which promises to prolong the day of light and liberality to our order.

Their hopes I trust are not too fan guine; for the design of this society has already drawn the attention of our most gracious /overeign, whose watchful eye is upon every corner of his dominions, to preserve and extend the reign of liberty and happiness among his people. His Majesty's approbation was first expressed, by his grant of a royal charter, by which you you are formed into a corporate body;
which was soon after inforced by a most liberal donation. His illustrious example will be followed. For, whatever marks of degeneracy may belong to this age, a want of munificence is none of them, nor a low standard of virtue; else the king on the throne would not be so much loved and revered.

Need I address myself to you, my Reve rend Brethren, who are so deeply interested in those who are to reap the benefit of this humane and beneficent institution, which along with relief, however, carries with it a proof of your indigent condition.
The commencement of the wonderful progrefs of this country in industry and wealth, is within the remembrance of the -,'oungeft among you. You have contributed to this national prosperity, by those excellent lelTons of sobriety and virtue, of industry and oeconomy, which you have given your people, and by the example that you have set before them. All ranks have have profited by it, but you. The proprietor has more than doubled his rent, the tradefinanhis flock, the husbandman and labourer his profits and wages. You alone remain in general with the ifme scanty allowance, which was fettled on you almnoft a century ago : Which then indeed bore some reasonable proportion to the state of the country, but is now depreciated to one third of the value it had then.
Your good conduct, has likcwifc had no fnall fiare in preserving the peace of the country, as well as in promoting its profperity, while it has raised your reputation, as high as that of any clergy in Europe.
What recompence might have been expected for your uniform and tfeady virtue ?

You wish for no more, than is abfo lutely necessary to preisrve the credit of your order. You with to be put as nearly as may be into the fame proportional itate, in refpec to the advanced opulence of your country, as was held by your predecessors, for some time after the Presbyterian church F wras was restored. Preferment and rewards'
are out of the question. Our eftablihmnent admits osso few that they need hardly be mentioned. But set apart as you are, and devoted to the public welfare and .happiness, and precluded from every lucrative employment, you surely ought to be raiied above a degrading slate of poverty.
You are entitled to a competency, that you may perform your duty with due freedom of spirit; that you may occasionally exercise the evangelical virtues of hofpitality and almsgiving; that you may give your children the rudiments of a libei-al education, and, having nothing else to befirow, may leave them the credit and pro.
tection of 3your good name.

If this is denied you, ascribe it not to the want of countenance from those who hold the executive government of this country, for they have exprefTid their fa, your fr r yo, in the moit unequivocal terms. Afl-ibe it not to the supreme court of law ; for, governed by a manly and li beral beral spirit, that body must often regret that their powers are too much limited.
Surely you cannot ascribe it to the ariflocracy of this country; whose generous minds, expanding with their fortunes, muff prompt them to impart to you some Jhall share of their accumulated wealth, for your faithful services, and to preserve you in the capacity of serving them more.
Surely, warned by the danger to which they were bo lately exposed, they mull wifl to unite you, as much as poflble, to themselves, and to tie closer the bond of amity between you; and, foreseeing the future in the pait, mutl wifely provide againft the next evil day, when the demon of sedition lhall rage once more, and the people again imagine a vain thinlg Whatever fiall liappen, console your selves with this, that the public opinion is strongly in your favour, and that as there is no government so much swayed by opinion as ours, if you preserve your character for purity of manners, and im portance portance to your country, sooner or later lhe must do you justice. In the mean time, should any of you be cut off in the midtime of your clays, which is frequently the lot of the best of men, you are not so forlorn as many of your predecessors of late have been, for you may comfort your elves withr the pleasing profped that is opened up to you, in the paternal care and guardianship of this moit benevolent society. W/hom nzmay the God of theJatherIejs prosper and blejs f Let me conclude by addrefilng myself to the contributors at large, and all who encourage this most laudable und-ertaking. If there is any truth in what I have represented, you have the fatisfacion and the honour of contributing to preserve, in some degree of credit, an order of men noft useful and necessary for the support of religion, of morals, and good order in the state. To you it will be owing that a minister of the gospel, who has laboured ail his life for the good of fouls, and who, conscious conscious of diligence and fidelity in his laster's work, has nothing to fadden the evening of his days, but anxious fears for those he ihall leave behind him, may now meet the last hour with unconcern, because his children if they are worthy, may become the adopted children of this Society; will be treated with all the prudent care, if not with the fond partiality of paternal affection, and with more wisdom and providence than they could have fliewn, will be safely ushered into the world.

You understand the full force of that faying of our Lord's, It is more blefed to give than to receive. You look forward with joy to that great day when all you have done ffiall meet with that kind interpretation from your Redeemer and Judge, ForaJinuch as rou have done it unto the leafi of the/e you have done it unto me. You have discovered the chief good. You have learned to anticipate celestial joys; for charity is heaven begun in the heart of man, and paradise itfelfis only the consummation of charity. Amen.A SERMON ON THE DEATH OF SIR DAVID DALRYMPLE 

KING Solomon, like other wife men, of whom he was the chief, sometimes communicates truth in paradoxes, to raise attention, and excite enquiry. The direct contrary of those sayings, at first fight, appears to be true, but a close examination brings round the mind to yield its firmest assent. A good name, fays he, verse i., is better than precious ointment, and the 'day of A death death than the day of one's birth. V. 2. It is better to, go to the hoife of mourning, than to the hoife offefting, for that is the end of a!/ men, and the living will lay it to his heart.
In confirmation of which last he adds, in the words of my text, Sorrow is better than tllaghter, fr by the fadntefr of the countenance the heart is made better. As if he had said, 
IT is true, and you may be assured of it, 
however incredible it may appear, That the grave and serious difpofiti6n of the house of mourning, the compafion and grief, which arise on the folamn occasions of performing the last offices of humanity to our friends and brethren, is far preferable, on many accounts, to the gay and frolicsome temper of the house of feasting, to that mirth and laughter which is excited in feflive aflemblies; and those serious occasions ought especially to be fought after, and a correfponding disposition cultivated by us mortals, who are in a slate of preparation for another world, because they have a happy influence in mending the heart.

THE IN our journey through this life, we mufl tot be so much amused with the entertainments of it, as to lose fight of the heavenly Jerusalem, whither we are going. And to assure to ourselves a mansion in that blessed abode, the proper method is, not so much to please our fancies, as to improve our hearts in virtue. For this purpose, ease and fePcivity are not experienced to be friendly, but seasons of afflicion have been found by the wife to have a salutary efficd. It shall be the aim of this discourse, to impress you with a sense of the necessity of sometimes encouraging a serious and recollected temper of mind, and to reconcile you to those fad and mournful scenes, that are moll likely to produce such dispositions.

WITH this view, all I propose to do, 
under divine assistance, is to set forth, in some instances, the chief excellence of forrow, or the sadness of the countenance, That by it the heart is made better. In the FIRST ( 6 )

FIRST place, then, By sorrow and the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better, because it is of great use to mortify our pride.

Tbo' pride was not made for man, whose foundation is in the duif, and whose gloy, is but like the flower of the grass, yet doth he often exalt hinflEf agaijl the Moji High God, and fay with dreadful infoience of heart, what is the Almighty that I fiould serve him; and what profit hall I have f I pray unto him ?
Thus departeth he from God, aud his heart is turned from the Lord his Maker, by that pride which is hateful to God and Man, and which is the beginning offin, ECCL. x. iS. and vii.
13. And what disease of the mind, what moral illness can be a greater obftacie to our lalvation and happiness, what more dangerous to the life of our fouls? For it is the very nature of this disorder to rejeEt all ofsered assistance, to despise and resist all propofals and attempts towards a cure.

BUT (7)

BUT the Almighty and kind Physician of fouls withholds not his saving help, nor ihortens his friendly arm, though we are froward, and think ourselves whole. For he deals around the humbling strokes of his Providence, to raise in us that fadcs es fthe counteiance, by ' wicb ibe h:eart i' made better.
He casts the neceftary portion of sorrow into the cfale, to counterbalance that immoderate elation of the heart, which is the nourifher of pride.

Now sorrow is a felf-annihilating passion, 
that dwells upon the weakness and vanity of our condition, and sets before us, in the moit striking light, every circumstance that can render us mean and contemptible in our own eyes. It brings down every vain thought and high imagination, presents us with the mortifying profped of all our boafled endowments and possessions laid in the dust, and reduces the mind to such a low and desolate tfate, that then, if ever, it will have recourse to its first principles of trodt in the Lord Jebovah it will bring to remembrance the ( 8 )

the Man offorrows, whop was meek and lowz ly of heart, and revive that sense of present Deity, which alone can give it relief.

AND what, my brethren, can more effec-.

tually humble the pride of human nature than a serious attention to the objets of forrow ? What is there so well suited to produce in us that fecf-abafement, he which who poffejes not JJall never be exalted ?

To behold the pride of riches brought down to the level of the grave ! allthe pomp and magnificence of life conclude in the diimal solemnity of a funeral ! To fee the renowned hero, for whose valour and activity, this spacious globe was but a scanty theatre, circumscribed within the narrow limits of a coffin and a tomb ! To observe the tongue of the wife and learned, that swayed the multitude to all his designs, become mute and silenced forever ! To behold man, the lordlieft creature in this world, in all the unforefeeing haughtiness of youth perhaps, brought down down in a few hours to the humble bed of sickness and of death: his bloom of beauty changed into ghastly paleness; the glory of his strength turned into infant weakness ; helpless, forlorn, and agonized, beyond the reach of power or of riches, of art or of science, to relieve or detain for one moment ! These are fad and mournful scenes ! To make us athamed of our pride! Surely these are scenes of sorrow, by which the heart is made better ! Again, 
SECONDLY, By sorrow, and the sadness of the countenance-the heart is made better, because it lefrens our attachment to the world, and the things of the world.

As ridiculous as it appears, for an immor talfoul to labour for the nzeat which peri /eth;
to waite its noble faculties in making provision for the JflJ, and in laying 'p treafJres upon earth, since these things can never satisfy the desires of a free and rational spirit, which God made for himself, and which must be restless and unhappy when it is not B returning returning to him again ; as strange as this conduc may seem, yet it is undeniably true, that we are all too apt to set our affecions on the world and its enjoyments, and to place our highefi hopes, and seek our chief felicity in them; than which fond attachment, there is nothing that enters into the heart of man more opposite and hoffile to all religious improvement.

Now sorrow has an excellent influence in leflening this vicious attachment to the world, inasmuch as it greatly abates that keen relish for outward enjoyments, which renders them so dangerous to the welfare of our fouls. Sackcloth and alhes, silence and darkness, and abstinence from whatever could delight the senses, which was the mourning of the ancient patriarchs according to the Old Testament, might sometimes indeed be pradifed then, as it may be still, in oftentation of a grief,they did not feel. But the simplicity of their manners, as well as the nature of the thing itself, leaves us no room to doubt, that it was, for the most part, a genuine effect, and expression of true and undissembled sorrow. Thus did these good men, and thus do all of us who are not greatly corrupted, in some measure, fulil the days of our mourning. For what heart has ever been deeply finitten with sorrow, that has not felt the truth of this obfervation ? In those hours of uneasiness and wo, have not all that can take too fast hold of the foul, the most pleasant gratifications of sense, and even the joys of friendship and sweet society, been rendered insipid and diftasteful!

THERE are certain persons, indeed, of a more refined temper of mind, and more delicate sentiments, than to admit the gross enjoyments of sense to the pofefflion of their hearts, who will notwithstanding take the world into their bosoms in a more plausible shape, and raise therein as dangerous rivals to God and religion. For theyallow it to infinuate itself into their minds,under the appearance of natural affection, fiiendfhip, or some other commendable passion, till it chain them down with those cords of love, and bands of a man, to a state of as abject slavery, as that of the greatet sensualist upon earth.
The most beautiful affedions of our nature are not incapable of abuse and vicious excess; for he that loveth father or mother, fays Christ himself, more than me, is not ·worlby of me; and be that loveth on or dazighter more than me, is not worthy oJf e. MAT.
x. 39.

IN this cafe, the heart-improving effe&

of sorrow, must be evident to all: For the Great Governor of the world chaflifes his creatures with the kindness of a father, when he fends his messinger, Death, for those darlings of their hearts, and throws down those idol gods that profane his most sacred temple. Thus rebukes he at once their forgetfulness of him, and removes the cause of it;
awakens them into a sense of their duty, and clears away the impediments to the performance of it; and snatches from them those dear objects that engage all their love and attention, that they may perceive and acknowledge acknowledge that sovereign and bountiful hand which gives them ail things richly to enjoy. Nor can it be doubted, that such is truly the effed of a deep-felt sorrow; for when can the mind be more sensible of the vanity of all earthly pofleffions, when is it more likely to perceive the folly of violent attachments to frail and mortal men, than in those days of fad reflecion, when the death of a dear relation, or beloved friend, has difsolved as it were the charm that made this world delightful, broke the chain that tied it to sublunary things, and destroyed all its imaginary schemes of happiness?

BUT, besides the grief which arises on those interesting occasions, what can more discredit the goods of fortune, and all outward things, than a serious attention to the general objects of sorrow ? For what does outward good avail against disease or death ?
Can the pofleffion of all the enjoyments of sense, through a long and prosperous life, afluage the pains of a bed of sickness ? And if they cannot relieve the body, how much leis less influence must they have to - sooth the anguith of the mind? Can they heal a wounded spirit, or Jfop the gnawings of the worm that dieth not ? Can they draw a veil over the terrors of the future world,that come awfully near in that dreadful extremity?
No surely. Something else muff attend the death of the righteous; Something more fpiritual muff prepare a foul for the other world, and enable it to enter with confidence and joy into the presence of the Great Creator. Thus the discovery of their uselessness to man in his greatest necessity, must lessen our attachment to the world, and the things of the world.

AGAIN,in the THIRD place, another heart improving effeEc offorrow and thefadnefi of the countenance, is, that thereby tender and charitable dispositions are strengthened and cultivated in our minds.

THE temper of the hortfe of feaJling, that levity of mind which accompanies immoderate indulgence in outward pleasure, has a most most unhappy tendency to fifle the sentiments of humanity, and to render us insenfible to the wants and calamities of our brethren. Attention to the distress of others is painful to us in that state, because it interrupts, and in some measure upbraids our joy; and therefore, hardening our hearts, we dismiss it as soon as we can. Thus do voluptuous men flop their ears at the cries of the poor, and turn away their eyes from beholding piteous objets; flattering their consciences perhaps with the false excuse of Behold we knew it not; and forgetting that he who pondereth the heart doth coniider it, and will render to every man according to his works. PRov. xxiv. I , 12.

Now sorrow is undoubtedly a very pro per cure for this disease of the mind; for it softens the heart to an extreme degree of sensibility, and raises in it all those kind, gentle, and compassionate dispositions, that are so nearly akin to itself, so deeply rooted in our nature, and so useful ahd ornamental to human life. This all good men have ac knowledged khcewledged to be one of the greatest and most certain effeds of sorrow and afflicion;
and for this cause our blessed Saviour himself was in all things made like unto his brethren, fubjefed to the wants, the pains and griefs of human nature; that being touched with the feeling of our infirmities, he might be a merciful andfaithfil Hi-gh PrieJ/. But this effed of sorrow is so obvious, that it needs no further illustration, and therefore I proceed to the FOURTH instance, 
AND it is the LAST I shall mention;

wherein by fArrow and the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better, that is, That we are thereby roused to a sense of our own mortality, and excited to prepare for death.

As much as all we fee around us, and every day's experience concur to the proof of man's mortality; although we cannot fail to perceive the frailty of our nature, and to feel the feedsof death ihooting forth in a thousand various diseases in there frail bodies of of ours, yet so much are we engaged in the pursuits of this world, that we seldom betlow on that awful event, the serious consideration it undoubtedly deserves, but hastily dismiss it from our thoughts, when it presumes to enter there, and chace it as far as possible from our relutant fight, 
IT is therefore one of the greatest spirit ual advantages of sorrow and the sadness of the countenance, that it awakens men out of that fatal unconcern, and gives them the loudest alarm to prepare for an hereafter.
And indeed when our pride is mortified, our love of the world subdued, and every humane and tender affedion kindled in our breafts,-then, if ever, will we be in a favourable disposition, to attend to the circumftances and condition of our nature, to confider our latter end, and the measure of our days, and to know howfrail we are.

THIS is the reason why the wife Solomon prefers the house of mourning to the honfe of feafling, because it is the end of ll men, and C the the living will lay it to his heart. And who that i snot-more insensible than things inanimate, can remain unmoved on those interefting occasions ? Who can fee his dearest acquaintance and friends ly down in the dust, not to rife again till the heavens be no more, and to have no portion forevec in any thing that is done under the fin; Who can behold this end of all men without laying it to his bxart ? without deeply revolving in his mind, That he also must soon go to his long home, that he also must be involved in that universal calamity, which cometh alike unto all ?

AND if we are fully impressed with the sense, and duly affcted with the importance of death, that will surely stir us up to prepare for it. Can we behold the dreadful despair of such as are without hope in their death; can we be witnefles to their forlorh and defoiate condition, who have lived without virtue, without religion, without God in the world, and not take warning to fliun the rock on which they made ]jipwreck of their theirfalvation ? And,onthe otherhand can we behold the dying tranquillity of those who have made their peace with God, who have coifciences void of offence towards ( od ard towards men; Can we be fpedators of the faith, the hope, the joy, with which they enteron a new state of being, and not be excitedby that noble example, to live the ive of the righteous, that we may alo die like him .?

THUS have I endeavoured to illustrate the truth of the wife man's observation in our.
Text, That sorrow is better than laughter, for by thefadnefs of the countenance the heart is made better. And according to this maxim it will be our wisdom, and our interest to regulate our conduc.

BUT let us not imagine, that this doctrine obliges us to bear down our disposition to innocent mirth, which is a part of our nature, orto abstain from all amufemnents or recreations, as if they were altogether inconfiftent with the gravity and recollecion of a Christian. Our religion enjoins not, nor C 2 does does our spiritual interest require such aufte.
rity. All that is demanded of us, and all in.
deed that is neceffary,is thatwe use amusements seasonably and moderately, that we love them with no greater affection, and pursue them with no more eagerness, than is proportioned to their value; and that we never allow them to interfere with duties of everlasting obligation. Add to this, that whatever is natural, is attended with some fatisfastion;
pity which is a mixture of love and sorrow, diffuses a kind of pleating anxiety over the mind; and grief itself is not without its tender joys. Gravity and composure, is the source of the greatest and most excellent pleasures; for the highest joy is no more exprefled by laughter, than the deepest sorrow by tears.

LET us not, therefore, in future, addict ourselves so much to the house of feadqing, Let us not be so eagerly solicitous about mirth and pleasure, and so restless and irnpatient when we cannot procure it. Let us not encompass sea and land, to find where withal f 2 ]i withal to make our hearts glad. Nor let us dread sadness and sorrow as the greatest evil that can befal us; and, in compliance with fashionable mistakes, shun the house of mourning, and lose many opportunites of exercising iome of the be ft alTetions of our nature.

You may not unreasonably expet-, my brethren, that on this occasion, I should fay something of that most worthy person of eminence, Lord Hailles, who has so lately disappeared from among us, and been gathered to his fathers. For though our church does not encourage funeral discourses in general, because they are liable to much abuse;
yet would it be improper to allow those, whose distinguished talents and virtues asford a theme of inftruation to mankind, to fink down to the grave in silence, without endeavouring in the hour of sorrow, for your loss of such persons, to draw your attention to their example.

YouR TOUR loss did I fay? and'furely if ten righteolus were enough to have saved a wicked city from deftrudion, in the days of the patriarch Abraham, we have good reason in our degenerate days, deeply to regret the loss of one person of marked and pre-eminent virtue.

IT would not become me to enlarge on his charader as a supreme Judge in the civil and criminal courts, capacities in which he ated in the view of his country, from which he meritedand obtained high confidence and approbation; forhis knowledge of the laws was accurate and profound, and he. applied it in judgment, with the molt scrupulous integrity. In his proceedings in the criminal court, the fatisfadion he gave to the public could not be furpafed. His abhorrence of crimes, his tenderness for the criminals, his respect for the laws, and his reverential awe of the Omniscient Judge, inspired him on some occafions, with a commanding sublimity of thought, and a feeling solemnity of exprefsion, that made condemnation seem just, as the the doom of Providence to the criminals themselves, and raised a salutary horror of crimes in the breast of the audience.

CONSCIOUS of the dignity and import.

ance of the high office he held, he never departed from the decorum that becomes that reverend characder: which indeed it colt him no effort to support, because he aced from principle and sentiment, both in public and private. Affectionate to his family and relations, simple and mild in his manners, pure and conscientious in his morals, enlightened and entertaining in his conversation; he left society only to regret, that, devoted as he was to more important employments, he had so little time to spare for intercourse with them.

WHTY should I mention to you, his exten five learning, and his exquisite taste as a scholar? Hewaswell known tobe of high rank in the republic of letters, and his loss will be deeply felt through many of her departments. His labours in illustration of the hiftorv t 24 1 history of his country, and many othef works of profound erudition, remain as monuments of his accurate and faithful research for materials, and his found judgment in the feledion of them. It is of more importance to you, that I remind you of his unfeigned piety and devotion, of which you have so very often been witnefles where we now are. I must add, however, that his attendance on religious ordinances, was not merely out of refped to the laws, and for the fake of example, (motives which mhould never fail to have influence on persons of superior rank, for the most obvious reasons) but from principle and conviction, and the most conscientious regard to his duty; for he not only pradifed all the virtues and charities in proof of his faith, but he demonstrated the sincerity of his zeal, by the uncommon pains he took to illustrate primitive Christianity, and by his elaborate and able defences of it againft its enemies. Him therefore our religion itfelfhasjuft cause to lament, as a fallen bulwark of our Jerusalem ! May the King and Head of the church speedily repair her loft loss, that the gates of hell may never prevail rngainjt her !

THERE is another part of his character which I muff present to your view, because it has refped to the times, and because I know that you had a reverence for his worth, and a just regard for his opinions. Ill indeed can the times bear the loss of such an affecionate patriot, and able guardian of the laws of his country. But we must not mur-, mur at the will of Providence, which in its mercy, may have withdrawn the good man ,from the evil to come. In mercy I fay to him, whose righteous spirit was so deeply grieved, when he saw the wicked rage, and the people imagine a vain thing.

His profound researches into history, and his thorough knowledge of the laws, made him perfecly acquainted with the progress of the conftitutionof Britain,froim the first dawn of liberty in the common law of the land, and the trial by jury which precede all written records, and afterwards in the origin and D establishment efPablifhment of parliaments, through all its riciffitudes and dangers, till at last by the blessing of divine Providence, which brought many wonderful events to concur to the fame end, it was renewed, strengthened, and finally confirmed by the Revolution. At this blessed xra all the rights of men were defined and secured, and have ever since been sacredly preserved. Since that time, there has been no encroachment on perfonal freedom, or the security of property, on liberty of conscience or on the liberty of the press. The road to riches and preferment has been open to all men. The laws restrain us from nothing, but the power to violate the rights of.others. They have been ena&ed with common content. They have been adminifteredwithjuftice,andhavebeen equally applied to rich and poor, to high and low.
An exadt balance has been preserved among all the springs of the political machine; and through all the rough gales of foreign wars, and softer breezes of opposition, the vessel of state has been steered with safety and filccess. It was this goodly and venerable fabric of the British Constitution, which the deceafecl 1 27 ]

deceased most refpedable character contemplated with admiration and delight, (of late indeed with a mixture of anxiety and fear)
as the temple of piety, as the genuine source of greater happiness and freedom, to a larger portion of mankind, than ever flowed from any government upon earth. Gracious Heaven ! Why haft thou at this critical hour, deprived us of so able and zealous a friend to our afiaulted constitution ?

FOR, wonderful to tell, in the midftof this happy period of our history, which for a century past. has been such as cannot be parralelled, in any country under the fun, when we were reaping the happy effecs of our free and equal government in the most brilliant prosperity, when by its natural force, it had corrected some errors, and was in the train of preventing others; when the load of debts which had accrefced, by means of wars formerly begun and carried oil with the united voice of the nation, was rapidly diminifling by our late wife and fortunate .mneafures; when every man was fitting un D 2 der der his own vine and his ownfig-tree, to use the language of Scripture, enjoying the fruits of his industry, and contemplating with pleasing hopes, the future glory and happiness of his country;-Lo ! ,The enemy of human happiness, who is ever watchful, to sow tares in the good man's field, has most envioufly interfered, to mar so promising a harvest.

SOME evil spirits, taking advantage of the late occurrences in a neighbouring country, whose former government, it must be obferved, was totally the opposite of ours, and of the ferment and expeEtation, that has thereby been raised in the minds of men, have endeavoured of late, by sophistry and false arguments, by misrepresentation and lies, by raising fears and hopes that are equally groundless: By traducing all the superior orders of men,by every bold and insidious art, that malice could invent, and scurrilous tongues and pens express, to subvert the minds of a peaceful and happy people, and to persuade them, that they now are and have have long been under a fad deluflon: That their condition is totally the reverse of what they have experienced it to. be; that they have no constitution of government, that they enjoy no liberty; that their equal laws, are oppressive and unjust; that though the poor man enjoys the fruits of his labour un, disturbed as he ought to do, yet the rici has no right to what has been acquired by the labour of his forefathers; and that even our mild and virtuous king, who holds histhrone no less by the love and affeteion of his subjeds, than by the law of the land,, is an Ufurper and a Tyrant.

AND what is the purpose and design of all this false representation ? It is not, as they give out, merely to correct abuses in government, or to amend any defets that may be in the conffitution. No, no. These objects require no such violent mean for their accompliflhment. These are fubljeds of a parliamentary reform, whenever they are of moment enough to decferve its attention, and lead to no opportunity ofmifchief.

No, their design is, though concealed from the simple and the weak among them, yet avowed by the master spirits, to excite the minds of the people to commotion, to tumult, to revolt and rebellion, that they may lay in ruins the goodly fabric of this goverment, the work of ages, the envy of all the nations of the world, which so happily unites the possession of all the rights of men, with national prosperity; and by means of which at this hour, over all the world, acitizen of Britain wherever he comes, is treated with distinguished refped, as a being of a superior order.

WHAT, my brethren. can my feeble efforts do to flop the progress of this kindling fire could reasoning and argument avail, there is no time for it at present. All I can do now, is to warn you to take heed and be-.
ware ! To beware of those lying spirits who would reduce you to your ruin. Would to God ! that I had that warning voice, which cried aloud of old, when.Satan was let loose to take revenge on men, JWoe, woe, woe, /o ibe the inhabitants on earth ! Or that I could speak to you with the weight and authority of him, who so lately descended to the tomb, and now I trust enjoys the fruits of his righteousness ! Then would I beseech you, by all you hold dear, by your parents and families, by your wives and children, by your religion and liberty, by all your hopes in this world and that which is to come, to turn a deaf ear to the lying words of the reducer! What are your grievances? Did you perceive them till you were told ? Do you now feel them ? Will you not trust to your own experience, rather than to a band of dark conspirators ?

WHO are they? ó\nd what are their means for accomplishing their boasted designs ? Itwouldbeimproper, from this place,to give them the harhieft epithets they deserve;
but surely they are not the most enlightened and wife, the most liberal and disinterested, ·the most fober and industrious members of society: Not those who have either much characer or property to lose, but the difcon tented tented, the disappointed, or ambitious, who are devoid of talents to gratify their passions, unless it be in times of confusion; And what are their means for accomplishing their designs? They have none, but either a foreign force, which would at once turn the rage of every Briton against them, or following the example so lately set before them by that very foreign .enemy on whose aid they can only rely, to raise an ignorant, an unruly and desperate mob, which all great cities can furnifi, who, having nothing to lose, delight in scenes of riot and confusion;
and with them, as with an engine that has no w ill or direction of its own, to perpetrate their wicked purposes, and through rapine, havock and blood, to overturn religion, law, and the ancient constitution, that, under pretence of a free democracy, they may acquire dominion and wealth to them-.
selves.

BUT I trust in Divine Providence, that they ihall not be permitted to execute their execrable designs. I fee the wife and good, 
the the enlightened and intelligent, the fober and industrious, the quiet and peaceable of all ranks, have taken the alarm, and are forming Leagues of defence around the constitution, that is,around religion and liberty, property and law. I fee the Genius of Britain rifing indignant, to punish her ingrateful sons, and to repel the threatened invasion of her insolent foes. May divine wisdom and fortitude preside over her counsels, that light may spring out of darkness, and order fron confusion. AMEN.
