"The Battel of the Pygmies and Cranes, The Puppet-Show, and The Bowling-Green, are of the Mock-Heroic kind, the Subjects mean and trivial, seemingly incapable of Poetical Ornaments, but are raised to the Heroic, by a splendid Boldness of Expression, a Pomp of Verse, by Metaphors, Allusions, and Simili-tudes drawn from Things of a higher Class, and such as are suited by Nature to convey Ideas of Great-ness and Magnificence to the Mind. VIRGIL, in his Georgicks, is the great Master in this way, with this Difference only, that his is a serious Geandeur, this a Mimic one, his pro-duces Admiration, this Laughter."

"                           OF all the Nations in the World, the Romans have most excelled in the Art of Poetry, and even among the Romans VIRGIL has been the most deservedly celebra-ted;"
"from whom the justest Rules of this Art are rather to be taken, than from the dry Precepts of the Criticks. To the End there-fore that we may the more truly ascertain the Beauties and Faults which occur among the rest of the Writers of Heroic Poetry, let us compare them with the Style of VIRGIL; who, if he be in any Thing deficient, it is when he has sometimes in his Eclogues mingled such a Purity of Style, as is not en-tirely agreeable with the Dialect of Shepherds; and frequently the Dig-nity of his Verse seems no Way consonant to the Rural Pipe. In every Book of his Georgicks, he"
"treats of Country Affairs with an in-imitable Elegancy of Style; but, above all, we are most delighted with his last Book, Of the Nature of BEES; where, in a Poem on so inconsiderable a Subject, our Au-thor purposely affects a peculiarly solemn and pompous Style. In this Piece he compares the Labours of the BEES to those of the Cy-clops; and in the same lofty Num-bers recounts the Skirmishes of these little Insects among themselves, as he does the Rencounters of AENEAS and TURNUS. All along, the Generals of this small Republick, the Populace, the Factions, the Customs and Forms of Govern-ment"
"exercised within the narrow Limits of the Bee-hive, are described with an inexpressible Beauty and Magnificence. Throughout the whole Work, what mostly raises our Admiration, is, that in the Persuit of his Discourse on Plant  Grazing, and Agriculture, (waving the common Forms of Speech) he suits his Poetick Diction to so unpolite a Theme; how, seemingly depressed with the Mean-ness of his Subject, he never sinks into a Plebeian Style; but the Force and Energy of his Expression are so conspicuous, that many, too rashly indeed, have not scrupled to prefer the Georgicks to the Aeneid:"
"                           "
"But in a Work of this Nature, no other Parts of Poetry could be dis-played, except an Elegance of Style and Description: In both these Ways VIRGIL has this peculiar to himself, that he captivates the Soul with his wonderful Sweetness, and his Descriptions are as lively, as if we had the Object placed be-fore our Eyes."
"                        In the Purity of his Style next follows LUCRETIUS, whose Diction, allowing for his Obsolete-ness, and Numbers almost Prosa-ick, may challenge a Share of Praise in those who have any Taste of the Roman Eloquence: For scriptions"
"however, the second Post of Honour is due to CLAUDIAN, who has throughout, in a most beautiful Style, interwoven his agreeable Images; faulty in this alone, that he expatiates upon his Subjects beyond all Decency, and frequently gives us the same Thoughts, diversifyed only in Ex-pression. In this Art CLAUDIAN well knew the Progress he had made, for on whatsoever Topick he is engaged, he diligently searches out Matter for Description, nay most of the Subjects he has wrote upon are wholly such, as may be seen in his Prefaces, his Eclogues, his Books of the Rape of PROSER-PINE,"

"                        OVID (like a true Courtier as he was) describes the Affairs of Love in neat and polite Verse. In the rest of his Works we meet with the more vulgar Way of Expressi-on; for trusting to a good Genius, he was little solicitous about form a more elaborate Style; but yet in his Metamorphoses, he has painted in the greatest Perfection the various Changes of all Creatures, and his Transformations succeed one another with a most surprizing Ce-lerity."

"STATIUS has frequently dis-charged both these Requisites of a Poet we just now observed; LU-CAN neither, whose Diction, al though  very bombast, is not enlivened either by beautiful Phrases or Epi-thets, but comes nearer Prose than Poetry; nay, there is in him com-monly such a mean Choice of Words, as is sometimes even beneath Prose it self: And altho' he abounds in Descriptions, and is always making Excursions of that Kind, yet he seldom finishes his Work as he ought, or brings his Thoughts to any Justness of Conclusion."
"                        "
"                           "
"But now as to STATIUS, he has given us Compositions worthy of the Envy of the best Poets: But with all his Beauties he has greater Faults; for in his Expression he makes too much Use of Gigantick Words, and, not considering his Subject, mingles useless Thunder in his Numbers: Nor is he less faulty in his Descriptions, for, en-couraging too great a Heat, while he attempts to excel, he shoots be-yond his Mark, and swells unnatu-rally. Of both which Extreams CLAUDIAN is too often guilty."
"                        "

"And now, since there have been many Pieces written, and those of Note, on the Subject of VIRGIL Aeneis, (and less Notice is taken of the Poetry of STATIUS and LUCAN) to whose Productions only the Latines allow the Title of Epick Poetry. As to LUCAN, it has been often disputed whether his Pharsalia be a proper Subject for an Heroick Poem. For the Decision of this Point, we must enquire in-to the true Nature of Heroick Poetry, which our Countryman the Lord BACON has admirably described in his Treatise of The Advancement of Learning. From"
"whence it is sufficiently manifest, that History and Epic Poetry are by no means proper Companions; and therefore that LUCAN has very much failed in his principal Subject: The five Heroes who make the greatest Figure in his Poem, are CAESAR, POMPEY, BRUTUS, CATO, and CICERO; each of them indeed as distinguishable in their Lives, as they were lamented at their Deaths; Men whose Vir-tues, allowing for the Frailties of human Nature, came nearest to that Pitch of Heroick Perfection which other Poets have falsely at-tributed to their Heroes. LUCAN every where rails at CAESAR, and"
"passionately espouses POMPEY Interest, but most of all celebrates the Characters of BRUTUS and CATO for that Spirit of Stoicism, which he had equally imbibed with them: And indeed most of the Faults objected to LUCAN, are rather to be imputed to this Kind of Philosophy. From whence sprung that boundless Vein of Wit, and that peculiar Affectation of a lofty Style, which, like that of Men, he always delighted in, and therefore gives the Preference ra-ther to great, than good Actions: And upon this Account, in raising the Passions, (that most excellent Part of Poetry) he succeeded but"
"ill, because upon the Principles of his Philosophy, the Passions them-selves were accounted as absolutely unlawful. To confirm this, (pas-sing by many others) I will produce but one Instance: After CAESAR had obtained the Victory over POM-PEY in the Battle of Pharsalia, LU-CAN certainly (if he had enlarged on any Circumstance foreign to his Story) should, upon so remarkable an Occasion, have brought in POM-PEY lamenting his unhappy Fate in the most mournful Strain; es-pecially since he pays so high a ference to him throughout his whole Work; or at least (as there was an open Field for Grief) he"
"'should have introduced POMPEY, either complaining of Rome lost Liberty, the Death of his Friends, or his own Misfortunes. But LU-CAN is so far from raising the Passions to this just Heighth, that he warmly advises POMPEY (when vanquished he retires from the Field of Action) to commiserate the Con-dition of his Conqueror CAESAR, because he had not won the Day but by unjustifiable Methods."

"Manner? As if POMPEY, a Man in Years, an Exile, Miserable, and Vanquished, should have any Con-cern upon him for the Crimes of his Conqueror: He ought to have been very much stoicized indeed, who, despoiled of all the Goods of Fortune, could place the Sum of his Felicity in meer naked Virtue. But none of the Poets have touched this Passion of Grief like VIRGIL. The Generality of other Writers, when they attempt to move their Readers, offend in this Point, that they are too prolix in spinning out their Complaints, and think their Flood of Tears inexhaustible; or else, while they labour to express"

"the Greatness of their Genius, in the Profuseness of their Verse, ra-ther raise our Admiration at the Flowing of their Numbers, than excite our Pity in the Catastrophe of their Story. VIRGIL has care-fully avoided both these Extreams, and dresses his Images of Sorrow in their native Simplicity; and who-ever he makes to grieve, he always does it with a quick and tender Compassion: For according to CI-CERO, our Expressions of Grief ought to be short and concise, because our Tears quickly dry up, and it is unnatural to detain either an Auditor or a Reader in too long a Suspension of Grief."

"But to return to STATIUS, his Spirit is indeed lofty and aspiring, to which while he gives too great a Loose, he runs into Bombast, and to his Poetry often adds useless sounding Words. The Subject of his Thebais seems indeed suited to the Barbarity of his Genius, but is beneath the Dignity of an Heroic Poem. For neither ETEOCLES, POLYNICES, nor TYDEUS, whose Actions are recorded in this Poem, have any Thing in them, except their Valour, agreeable to Heroes: Nay, throughout the whole Piece there are no Examples produced, unless of Persons infamous for the"
"most flagitious Enormities, such as Parricide, Treachery, Cruelty, and Revenge; while, on the contrary, every Thing Praise-worthy shines bright in VIRGIL Heroes, and in the Person of AENEAS we have placed before our Eyes an Instance of consummate Piety towards the GODS, his Son, his Wife, his Friends, and his Father. The pithets of STATIUS are generally forced and very metaphorical, while such Properties are ascribed to In-animates, as really only belong to Animals. In the Choice of his Words, and frequently in his Me-taphors, he is followed by CLAU-DIAN with the utmost Elegance;"
"VIRGIL is sparing in both these Particulars; STATIUS abounds much with Similitudes, in which he seems to imitate VIRGIL; but in this Instance LUCAN had had better Success, if he had hit upon the proper Medium: But while VIRGIL stoops down to the hum-ble Subjects of Bees, Ants, and other such like delightful Themes of Nature; on the other Hand, LUCAN bellows out nothing but Stories of Oaks split by Lightning, Earthquakes, and the World Con-flagration. Let this, in short, suffice observable concerning the Writers of Heroic Poetry, in itself new, and never before taken No-tice of."

"Something now remains to be said of the Satyrists, among whom whether JUVENAL or HORACE have most Right to the Bays, it is difficult to determine; for it has been long a Dispute among the Learned, whether that Keenness and Bitterness of Expression with which JUVENAL has armed his Satires, or HORACE more jocose Lampoons are most agreeable to the End of SATIRE. Now that we may give a clearer Decision on this Head, a few Things must be pre-mised. HORACE bears to this Day, an ill Character for the Loose-ness of his Conduct in Life. JU-VENAL"
"was a rigid Practiser of Virtue. The one was conversant in the most perfectly polite Court of AUGUSTUS; the other lived in the Dregs of DOMITIAN Time; and therefore both these Poets ac-commodated their Writings to the Manners of the different Ages they lived in: For HORACE is entirely upon the ludicrous, and persues not so much the Licentiousness of the Times, as the ridiculous Fopperies of some particular Courtiers; for had he attempted to correct these Trifles with Severity, he had not missed of being laughed at: But JU-VENAL lashes the grossest Crimes prevalent in his Time, and com-plains"
"of Enormities which he was ashamed to mention, and nothing less than the highest Resentment of Soul, Ardency of Expression, and Sharpness of Speech, could be an equal Match to Crimes so notori-ous; though  whenever he descends to be jocose, we frequently meet with the Pleasantry of HORACE. Both of them, allowing for the different Manner of their Writing, are per-fect Masters in their several Ways; in the one shines the Ridicule, in the other the Severe. The rest of HORACE Pieces are so admira-ble, that they exceed our highest Encomiums, and are not only beyond our Dislike, but above our Praise."

"As to what concerns the Drama-tick Poets, PLAUTUS and TE-RENCE bear away the Bell, whose Plots, Turns, and Elegancy of Style, are so well known, that no-thing new can be said upon them."
"                        As to SENECA, Mankind have had different Opinions of him; some have ranked him with the best Tragoedians, others have sunk him below the worst. He certainly had a great Genius, an elegant and con-cise Way of Expression; he abounds with smart Turns, which always savour much of that Stoicism of which he was a Follower, upon"
"which Account he has always been esteemed by those who have had lit-tle or no Taste of Dramatick Poetry; but then if we consider him as such, his Tragedies are throughout too elaborate; and this, to pass by his other Faults, seems peculiarly SE-NECA  that he makes all his A-ctors (without any Regard to the Characters they bear) talk in the same Strain; all of them inculcate rigid philosophical Dogmata, and such Morality as is rather fit for the Schools of the Stoicks, than the Roman Theatre: For with him the King and the Slave strut in the same Buskin; nay, you may per-ceive the Nurse herself deeply"
"tinged with the Principles of Stoi-cism."
"                        Among the Epigrammatists, MAR-TIAL and CLAUDIAN have bore the greatest Reputation; the first, for the severe Point in the Close of his Epigrams, and the pecu-liar Jingle of his Words. The other, for dispersing the Poignancy of his Wit throughout his Epigrams, and that in the most beautiful Latin Phrase."

"                         Poesi Narrativa, sive eam Heroi-cam appellare placet (modo hoc intelligas Materia, non Versu) ea a Fundamento prorsus nobili excitata videtur, quod dig-nitatem humanae Naturae imprimis spectat. Cum enim Mundus sensibilis sit Anima ratio-nali dignitate inferior, videtur Poesis haec hu-manae Naturae largiri, quae Historia denegat; atque Animo umbris rerum utcunque fatisfa-cere, cum solida haberi non possint. Si quis enim Rem acutius introspiciat, firmum ex Poesi sumitur argumentum, Magnitudinem Rerum magis illustrem, Ordinem magis perfectum, &amp; Varietatem magis pulchram, Animae hu-manae complacere, quam in Natura ipsa post Lapsum reperire ullo modo possit. Quaprop-ter, cum Res gestae, &amp; Eventus, qui vere Hi-storiae subjiciuntur, non sint ejus Amplitudi-nis,"
"in qua Anima humana sibi satisfaciat, praesto est Poesis, quae Facta magis Heroica confingat: Cum Historia vera successus re-rum, minime pro meritis Virtutum &amp; Scele-rum narret; corrigit eam Poesis, &amp; exitus, &amp; fortunas secundum merita, &amp; ex lege Nemese-os exhibet: Cum Historia vera, obvia rerum satietate &amp; similitudine, animae humanae fa-stidio sit; reficit eam Poesis inexpectata &amp; va-ria, &amp; vicissitudinem plena canens. Adeo ut Poesis ista, non solum delectationem, sed etiam Animi magnitudinem, &amp; Mores conferat. Quare &amp; merito etiam Divinitatis cujuspiam particeps videri possit; quia ani-mum erigit, &amp; in sublime rapit: rerum simu-lachra animi desideria accommodando, non animum rebus (quod ratio facit &amp; Historia) submittendo."
"                        Thus translated, in the English Edition, by Dr. RAWLEY."
"                        As for Narrative Poesy, or, if you please, Heroical, (so you understand it of the Matter, not of the Verse) it seems to be raised altoge-ther from a noble Foundation, which makes much for the Dignity of Man Nature. For seeing this sensible World is in Dignity infe-rior to the Soul of Man, Poesy seems to en-dow human Nature with that which History denies; and to give Satisfaction to the Mind, with, at least, the Shadow of Things, where the Substance cannot be had. For if the Mat-ter be thoroughly considered, a strong Argu-ment"
"may be drawn from Poesy, that a more stately Greatness of Things, a more perfect Order, and a more beautiful Variety delights the Soul of Man, than any Way can be found in Nature since the Fall. Wherefore, seeing the Acts and Events which are the Subject of true History, are not of that Am-plitude as to content the Mind of Man, Poesy is ready at Hand to feign Acts more Heroical. Because true History reports the Successes of Business not proportionable to the Merit of Virtues and Vices, Poesy corrects it, and pre-sents Events and Fortunes according to sert, and according to the Law of Providence: Because true History, through  the frequent Satiety and Similitude of Things, works a Distaste and Misprision in the Mind of Man; Poesy cheereth and refresheth the Soul, chanting Things rare, and various, and full of Vicissi-tudes. So as Poesy serveth and conferreth to Delectation, Magnanimity, and Morality; and therefore it may seem deservedly to have some Participation of Divineness, because it doth raise the Mind to Things, as Reason and History do."

"Graces of the Augustan-Age. The Italians, by the Encouragement of the House of MEDICIS, first began the Study and Imitation of the best Roman Poets; and about the Time of Leo the Xth, there appeared a great Number of fine Genius  who endea-voured to shake off the Barbarity, and polish the Rust of an ignorant Age. The Event very near answered their Expectations, and the Muses seemed to be re-instated in their old Land of Inheritance. The Reader may see a Collection of their best Pieces in a Volume intituled Poetae Italici; but among all of them Vida is the most pure and elegant, though  some are of-fended at the perpetual Imitation of his Darling VIRGIL.

"the Antients, who began to sport and play in Essays of their Poetical Strength before they attempted Sub-jects of a greater Dignity. To speak of them in general, I observe that the Language is Pure, Elegant, and Sounding; the Versification easy and numerous, happily adapted to the different Subjects it describes, free from the affected Turns, Puerile Le-vities, and other Flatnesses, which betray a false Taste, and Defect of Judgment. The Critick every where accompanies the Poet, and even here a discerning Eye might have seen the Promises of a CAMPAIGN and a CATO."

"                     It is, indeed, wonderful to find in the narrow Compass of so few Pages all the most dreadful Circum-stances of that last terrible Crisis of Time: The Poem is a beautiful and succinct Epitome of all that has or can ever be said on that important Subject; the very Text, which the ingenious Mr. Young has so largely and elegantly paraphrased upon, in his excellent Poem on the LAST DAY."

"Mr. Addison is to be distinguished through  all his Performances both Latin and English (and in his Latin, parti-cularly in the following one, and that on the Peace of Reswick,) by the Strength of his Images, and by a forcible and unaffected Vivacity of Expression, which none of our Mo-derns have attained to in so much Perfection; and which is very rarely to be met with even in any of the Antients since Virgil and Horace."

"                     Having mentioned Mr. Addison, I cannot avoid congratulating my Country on his Preferment to one of her greatest Civil Employments; nor forbear observing how happy we are in a KING, who has shown the"
"World that he will distribute his Fa-vours amongst those only, whom Merit and Virtue shall recommend to his Service."
"                     With what uncommon Lustre must that Man appear to Posterity, who is not only the best Writer, and most candid Patron of the Age he lives in; but also the finest Gentleman, the sincerest Friend, the most affectionate Husband, the most accomplished Statesman, and the most exemplary Christian? Under every one of these Views Mr. Addison gains the Esteem and Admiration even of the bitterest Enemies to that Cause which he so warmly espouses, of the most furious Partisans, and the most prejudiced of Mankind."
