"            THE PREFACE."
"            "
"               THE following Lines are esteemed by the best Judges to be the finest Sketch of the Resur-rection, that any Age or Language hath produced: Nor do their on-ly Excellence consist in being an"
"accurate Poem; but also in being an exact Copy of the Painter's"
"                  Old Fuller riginal upon the Altar in Magda-len College; but so much impro-ved with all the strongest Figures and most lively Embellishments of a poetical Description, that the Reader receives a double Satisfa-ction in seeing the two Sister-Arts so useful to each other in borrowing mutual Helps, and mu-tual Advantages."
"            It is, indeed, wonderful to find in the narrow Compass of so few Pages all the most dreadful Cir-cumstances of that last terrible Crisis of Time: The Poem is a beautiful and succinct Epitome of all that hath or can ever be said"
"on that important Subject; the very Text, which the ingenious Mr. Young hath so largely and ele-gantly paraphrased upon in his excellent Poem on the LAST DAY."
"            Mr. Addison is to be distin-guished through  all his Performances both Latin and English, (and in his Latin, particularly in the fol-lowing one, and that on the Peace of Riswick), by the strength of his Images, and by a forcible and unaffected vivacity of Expression, which none of our Moderns have attained to in so much Perfection; and which is very rarely to be met with even in any of the Anti-ents since Virgil and Horace."
"            "
"            "
"               "
"Having mentioned Mr. Addison, I cannot avoid congratulating my Country on his Preferment to one of her greatest Civil Employ-ments; nor forbear observing how happy we are in a KING, who hath shown the World that he will distribute his Favours a-mongst those only, whom Merit and Virtue shall recommend to his Service."
"            With what uncommon Lustre must that Man appear to Posteri-ty, who is not only the best Wri-ter and most candid Patron of the Age he lives in; but also the fi-nest Gentleman, the sincerest Friend, the most affectionate Husband, the most accomplished"
"Statesman, and the most exem-plary Christian? Under every one of these Views Mr. Addison gains the Esteem and Admirati-on even of the bitterest Enemies to that Cause which he so warm-ly espouses; of the most furious Partisans and the most prejudiced of Mankind."
"            I must forbear to enlarge any farther on the Character of that truly great and good Man, lest I draw upon my self the imputati-on of a Flatterer, by relating what all the World (except him-self only) will allow to be the se-verest Truth."
"            I shall make no excuse for of-fering the following Poem to the"
"World in an English DRESS, and under all the Disadvantages of an imperfect Translation. I have often read it in the Original with the greatest Pleasure and Sa-tisfaction; and I hope it will need no Apology to be willing to com-municate so useful and sublime an Entertainment, in the best man-ner I can, to those of my Fellow-Subjects who are not qualifyed to read it in the Latin Original."
