"his Mercy; when the whole Kingdom of Spain is supplyed with his Manufactures, and the Wealth of the Indies flows into his Coffers; and what is yet worse, when this additional Strength must arise in all its particulars from a proportionable Decay in the States that now make War upon him? It is no wonder therefore that our late King of Glorious Memory, who by the Confession of his greatest Enemies, was a Prince that perfectly understood the Interests of Europe, should in his last Speech recommend to his Parliament the declaring War against France in those memorable Words: You have yet an Opportunity, by God blessing, to secure to you and your Posterity the quiet Enjoyment of your Religion and Liberties, if you are not wanting to your selves, but will exert the ancient Vigour of the English Nation: but I tell you plainly, my Opinion is, if you do not lay hold on this occasion, you have no reason to hope for another."
"            "
"            We have already a dreadful Proof of the Increase of Power that accrues to France from its Conjunction with Spain. So expensive a War as that which the French Monarchy hath"
"been carrying on in so many and so remote Parts at once, must long since have drained and exhausted all its Substance, had there not been several secret Springs, that swelled their Treasury from time to time, in proportion as the War has sunk it. The King Coffers have been often reduced to the lowest Ebb, but have still been sea-sonably refreshed by frequent and unexpected Supplies from the Spanish America. We hear indeed of the Arrival but of very few Ships from those Parts; but as in every Vessel there is Stowage for immense Treasures, when the Cargo is pure Bullion, or Merchandize of as great a Value; so we find by Expe-rience they have had such prodigious Sums of Money conveyed to them by these secret Channels, that they have been enabled to pay more numerous Armies, than they ever had on foot before; and that at a time when their Trade fails in all its other Branches, and is distressed by all the Arts and Con-trivances of their neighbouring Nations. Du-ring the last four Years, by a modest Com-putation there have been brought into Brest above six Millions of Pounds Sterling in Bullion. What then shall we suppose woued"
"be the effect of this Correspondence with America, might the Wealth of those Parts come to them on Squadrons of Men of War, and Fleets of Galeons? If these little By-currents, that creep into the Country by Stealth, have so great a Force, how shall we stem the whole Torrent, when it breaks in upon us with its full Violence? And this certainly will be our Case, unless we find a Means to dissolve the Union between France and Spain. I have dwelt the longer on this Consideration, because the present War hath already furnished us with the Experiment, and sensibly convinced us of the Increase of Power, which France has received from its In-tercourse with the Spanish West-Indies."
"            "
"            As there are many who look upon every thing which they don actually see and feel as bare Probability and Speculation, I shall only touch on those other Reasons of which we have already also had some Experience, for our preventing this Coalition of Interests and Designs in the two Monarchies."
"            The Woollen Manufacture is the British Strength, the staple Commodity and pro-per Growth of our Country; if this fails us, our Trade and Estates must sink together,"
"and all the Cash of the Nation be consumed on Foreign Merchandize. The French at present gain very much upon us in this great Article of our Trade, and since the Acces-sion of the Spanish Monarchy, supply with Cloath of their own making the very best Mart we had in Europe. And what a melan-choly Prospect have we, if ever a Peace gives them leave to enrich their Manufacture with Mixtures of Spanish Wool to multiply the Hands employed in it, to improve themselves in all the Niceties of the Art, and to vend their Wares in those Places where was the greatest Consumption of our Woollen Works, and the most considerable Gain for the Bri-tish Merchant. Notwithstanding our many seasonable Recruits from Portugal, and our Plantations, we already complain of our want of Bullion; and must at last be re-duced to the greatest Exigencies, if this great Source be dryed up, and our Traffick with Spain continue under its present Dis-couragement."
"            The Trade of the Levant must likewise flourish or decay in our Hands, as we are Friends or Enemies of the Spanish Monar-chy. The late Conquest of Naples will"
"very little alter the case, though Sicily should follow the Fate of her Sister Kingdom. The Streight Mouth is the Key of the Levant, and will be always in the Possession of those who are Kings of Spain. We may only add, that the same Causes which streighten the British Commerce, will naturally enlarge the French; and that the Naval Force of either Nation will thrive or languish in the same degree as their Commerce gathers or loses Strength. And if so powerful and populous a Nation as that of France be-come superior to us by Sea, our whole is lost, and we are no more a People. The Consideration of so narrow a Channel be-twixt us, of such Numbers of regular Troops on the Enemy side, of so small a stand Force on our own, and that too in a Country destitute of all such Forts and strong Places as might stop the Progress of a victorious Army, hath something in it so terrifying, that one does not care for setting it in its proper Light. Let it not therefore enter into the Heart of any one that hath the least Zeal for his Religion, or Love of Liberty, that hath any regard either to the Honour or Safety of his Country, or a well"
"Wish for his Friends or Posterity, to think of a Peace with France, till the Spanish Monarchy be entirely torn from it, and the House of Bourbon disabled from ever giving the Law to Europe."
"            "
"            Let us suppose that the French King would grant us the most advantageous Terms we can desire; without the Separation of the two Monarchies they must infallibly end in our struction. Shoued he secure to us all our pre-sent Acquisitions; shoued he add two or three Frontier-Towns to what we have already in Flanders; shoued he join the Kingdoms of Si-cily and Sardinia to Milan and Naples; shoued he leave King Charles in the peaceable Posses-sion of Catalonia; shoued he make over to Great Britain the Town and Harbour of Ca-dis, as well as that of Gibraltar, and at the same time resign his Conquests in Portugal; it woued all be of no effect towards the com-mon Safety of Europe, while the Bulk of the Spanish Continent, and the Riches of America remain in the Possession of the Bourbon Fa-mily."
"            "
"               Boccalini when he weighs the States of Eu-rope in his Political Balance, after having laid France in one Scale, throws Spain into the"
"other, which wanted but very little of being a Counter-poise. The Spaniards upon this, says he, begun to promise themselves the Ho-nour of the Ballance; reckoning that if Spain of it self weighed so well, they coued not fail of Success when the several Parts of the Monarchy were lumped in the same Scale. Their Surprise was very great when upon the throwing in of Naples they saw the Scale rise, and was greater still when they found that Milan and Flanders had the same effect. The truth of it is, these parts of the Spanish Mo-narchy are rather for Ornament than Strength. They furnish out Vice-royalties for the Gran-dees, and Posts of Honour for the Noble Fa-milies; but in a time of War are Incumbran-ces to the main Body of the Kingdom, and leave it naked and exposed by the great num-ber of Hands they draw from it to their fence. Shoued we therefore continue in the Possession of what we have already made our selves Masters, with such Additions as have been mentioned, we shoued have little more than the Excrescencies of the Spanish Monarchy. The Strength of it will still join it self to France, and grow the closer to it by its Disunion from the rest. And in this case"
"the Advantages which must arise to that Peo-ple from their intimate Alliance with the re-maining part of the Spanish Dominions, woued in a very few Years not only repair all the Da-mages they have sustained in the present War, but fill the Kingdom with more Riches than it hath yet had in its most flourishing Periods."
"            The French King hath often entered on se-veral expensive Projects, on purpose to dissi-pate the Wealth that is continually gathering in his Coffers in times of Peace. He hath employed immense Sums on Architecture, Gardening, Water-Works, Painting, Statua-ry, and the like, to distribute his Treasures among his People, as well as to humour his Pleasures and his Ambition: But if he once engrosses the Commerce of the Spanish In-dies, whatever Quantities of Gold and Silver stagnate in his private Coffers, there will be still enough to carry on the Circulation among his Subjects. By this means in a short space of time he may heap up greater Wealth than all the Princes of Europe joined together; and in the present Constitution of the World, Wealth and Power are but different Names for the same thing. Let us therefore suppose that after eight or ten Years of Peace, he hath"
"a mind to infringe any of his Treaties, or in-vade a neighbouring State; to revive the Pre-tensions of Spain upon Portugal, or attempt the taking those Places which were granted us for our Security; what Resistance, what Opposi can we make to so formidable an Ene-my? Shoued the same Alliance rise against him that is now in War with him, what coued we hope for from it, at a time when the States engaged in it will be comparatively weakened, and the Enemy who is now able to keep them at a stand, will have received so many new Accessions of Strength."
"            But I think it is not to be imagined that in such a Conjuncture as we here suppose, the same Confederates, or any other of equal Force coued be prevailed upon to join their Arms and endeavour at the pulling down so exorbitant a Power. Some might be bought into his Interests by Money, others drawn over by Fear, and those that are liable to nei-ther of these Impressions, might not think their own Interest so much concerned as in the present War; or if any appeared in a dis-position to enter into such a Confederacy, they might be crushed separately before they coued concert Measures for their mutual Defence."
"            "
"               "
"The keeping together of the present Al-liance can be ascribed to nothing else but the clear and evident Conviction which every Member of it is under, that if it shoued once break without having had its effect, they can never hope for another Opportunity of reuni-ting, or of prevailing by all the joint Efforts of such an Union. Let us therefore agree on this as a fixt Rule, and an inviolable Maxim, never to lay down our Arms against France, till we have utterly disjoyned her from the Spanish Monarchy. Let this be the first Step of a publick Treaty, the Basis of a general Peace."
"            Had the present War indeed run against us, and all our Attacks upon the Enemy been vain, it might look like a degree of Frenzy, or a Mixture of Obstinacy and Despair, to be determined on so impracticable an Underta-king. But on the contrary, we have already done a great part of our Work, and are come within view of the End that we have been so long driving at. We remain victorious in all the Seats of War. In Flanders we have got into our hands several open Countries, rich Towns, and fortified Places. We have driven the Enemy out of all his Alliances, dispossest him of his Strong Holds, and"

"ruined his Allies in Germany. We have not only recovered what the Beginning of the War had taken from us, but possest ourselves of the Kingdom of Naples, the Dutchy of Mi-lan, and an Avenue of France in Italy. The Spanish War hath given us a Haven for our Ships, and the most populous and wealthy Province of that Kingdom. In short, we have taken all the outlying parts of the Spanish Monarchy, and made Impressions upon the very Heart of it. We have beaten the French from all their advanced Posts in Europe, and driven them into their last Entrench-ments. One vigorous Push on all sides, one general Assault will force the Enemy to cry out for Quarter, and surrender themselves at discretion. Another Blenheim or Ramillies will make the Confederates Masters of their own Terms, and Arbitrators of a Peace."
"            But notwithstanding the Advantages already gained are very considerable if we pursue them, they will be of no effect unless we improve them towards the carrying of our main point. The Enemy staggers; if you follow your Blow, he falls at your Feet; but if you allow him respite, he will recover his Strength, and come upon you with greater Fury. We have given"
"him several repeated Wounds that have en-feebled him, and brought him low; but they are such as time will heal, unless you take advantage from his present Weakness to re-double your Attacks upon him. It was a cele-brated part in Caesar Character, and what comes home to our present purpose, that he thought nothing at all was done, while any thing remained undone. In short, we have been tugging a great while against the Stream, and have almost weathered our point; a Stretch or two more will do the Work; but if in-stead of that we slacken our Arms, and drop our Oars, we shall be hurried back in a mo-ment to the place from whence we first set out."
"            After having seen the Neecessity of an en-tire Separation of the Kingdoms of France and Spain, our Subject naturally leads us into the Consideration of the most proper means for effecting it."
"            We have a great while flattered ourselves with the prospect of reducing France to our own Terms by the want of Money among the People, and the Exigencies of the publick Treasury; but have been still disappointed by the great Sums imported from America,"
"               "
"and the many new Expedients which the Court hath found out for its Relief. A long consumptive War is more likely to break the Grand Alliance, than disable France from maintaining sufficient Armies to oppose it. An arbitrary Government will never want Money; so long as the People have it; and so active a People will always have it, whilst they can send what Merchandises they please to Mexico and Peru. The French since their Alliance with Spain keep thirty Ships in con-stant Motion between the Western Ports of France and the South Seas of America. The King himself is an Adventurer in this Traffick, and besides the Share that he receives out of the Gains of his Subjects, has immense Sums that come directly from it into his own Hands."
"            We may further consider, that the French since their abandoning Bavaria and Italy have very much retrenched the Expence of the War, and lay out among themselves all the Money that is consumed in it."
"            Many are of Opinion, that the most probable way of bringing France to Reason woued be by the making an Attempt upon the Spanish West-Indies, and by that means to cut off all Com-munication"
"with this great Source of Riches, or turn the Current of it into our own Coun-try. This I must confess carries so promising an appearance, that I would by no means discou-rage the Attempt: But at the same time I think it should be a collateral Project, rather than our principal Design. Such an Undertaking (if well concerted, and put into good Hands) would be of infinite Advantage to the Common Cause: but certainly an Enter-prise that carries in it the Fate of Europe, should not turn upon the Uncertainty of Winds and Waves, and be liable to all the Accidents that may befal a Naval Expedition."
"            Others there are that have long deceived themselves with the hopes of an Insurre-ction in France, and are therefore for laying out all our Strength on a Descent. These, I think, do not enough consider the natural Love which the gross of Mankind have for the Constitution of their Fathers. A Man that is not enlightned by Travail or Reflexion, grows as fond of Arbitrary Power, to which he hath been used from his Infancy, as of cold Climates or barren Countries, in which he hath been born and bred. Besides, there is a kind of sluggish Resignation, as well as"
"poorness and degeneracy of Spirit, in a state of Slavery, that we meet with but very few who will be at the pains or danger of reco-vering themselves out of it; as we find in Hi-story Instances of Persons who after their Pri-sons have been flung open, and their Fetters struck off, have chosen rather to languish in their Dungeons, than stake their miserable Lives and Fortunes upon the Success of a Re-volution. I need not instance the general Fate of Descents, the Difficulty of supplying Men and Provisions by Sea against an Enemy that hath both at hand, and without which it is impossible to secure those Conquests that are often made in the first Onsets of an Inva-sion. For these and other Reasons I can never approve the nursing up Commotions and Insur-rections in the Enemy Country, which for want of the necessary Support are likely to end in the Massacre of our Friends and the Ruin of their Families."
"            The only means therefore for bringing France to our Conditions, and what appears to me, in all human probability, a sure and in-fallible Expedient, is to throw in Multitudes upon 'em, and overpower 'em with Numbers, Would the Confederacy exert it self as much"
"to annoy the Enemy, as they themselves for their Defence, we might bear them down with the weight of our Armies, and in one Summer overset the whole Power of France."
"            "
"            The French Monarchy is already exhausted of its best and bravest Subjects. The Flower of the Nation is consumed in its Wars: The Strength of their Armies consists at present of such as have saved themselves by flight from some or other of the victorious Confederates; and the only proper Persons to recruit them are but the Refuse of those who have been al-ready picked out for the Service. Mareschal Vauban, though  infinitely partial in his Cal-culations of the Power of France, reckons that the Number of its Inhabitants was two Mil-lions less at the Peace of Ryswick, than in the beginning of the War that was there con-cluded: And though  that War continued Nine Years, and this hath as yet lasted but Six, yet considering that their Armies are more strong and numerous; that there hath been much more Action in the present War; and that their Losses sustained in it have been very ex-traordinary; we may, by a moderate Com-putation, suppose that the present War hath not been less prejudicial than the foregoing"
"one in the Ravage which it has made a-among the People. There is in France so great a disproportion between the number of Males and Females; and among the former, between those who are capable of bearing Arms, and such as are too young, sickly, or decrepit for the Service; and at the same time such vast numbers of Ecclesiasticks, Se-cular and Religious, who live upon the bours of others, that when the several Trades and Professions are supplyed, you will find most of those that are proper for War abso-lutely necessary for filling up the laborious part of Life, and carrying on the Under-work of the Nation. They have already con-tributed all their superfluous Hands, and eve-ry new Levy they make must be at the Ex-pence of their Farms and Vineyards, their Manufactures and Commerce."
"            On the contrary, the Grand Alliance have innumerable Sources of Recruits, not only in Britain and Ireland, the "
"                  Ʋnited Provinces, and Flanders; but in all the populous parts of Germany that have little Trade or Manu-factures, in proportion to the number of their Inhabitants. We may add, that the French have only Switzerland, besides their own Country,"
"to recruit in; and we know the Difficulties they meet with in getting thence a single Regiment: Whereas the Allies have not only the same Ressource, but may be supplyed for Mony from Denmark and other Neutral States. In short, the Confederates may bring to the Field what Forces they please, if they will be at the charge of 'em: but France, let her Wealth be what it will, must content her-self with the Product of her own Country."
"            The French are still in greater streights for Supplies of Horse than Men. The Breed of their Country is neither so good nor nume-rous as what are to be found in most of the Countries of the Allies. They had last Sum-mer about Threescore Thousand in their seve-ral Armies, and coued not perhaps bring into the Field 30000 more, if they were disposed to make such an Augmentation."
"            The French Horse are not only few, but weak in comparison of ours. Their Ca-valry in the Battle of Blenheim coued not sustain the Shock of the British Horse. For this reason our late way of attacking their Troops Sword in Hand is very much to the Advantage of our Nation, as our Men are more robust, and our Horses of a stronger"
"Make than the French; and in such Attacks it is the Weight of the Forces, supposing equal Courage and Conduct, that will always carry it. The English Strength turned very much to account in our Wars against the French of old, when we used to gall them with our long Bows, at a greater Distance than they could shoot their Arrows: This Advantage we lost upon the Invention of Fire-Arms, but by the present Method our Strength as well as Bravery may again be of use to us in the Day of Battle."
"            We have very great Encouragement to send what Numbers we are able into the Field, be-cause our Generals at present are such as are likely to make the best use of them, without throwing them away on any Rash Attempts or ill-concerted Projects. The Confederate Ar-mies have the Happiness of being commanded by Persons who are esteemed the greatest Lea-ders of the present Age, and are perhaps equal to any that have preceded them. There is a sort of Resemblance in their Characters; A particular Sedateness in their Conversation and Behaviour, that qualifies them for Coun-cil, with a great Intrepidity and Resolution that fits them for Action. They are all of them"
"Men of concealed Fire, that doth not break out with Noise and Heat in the ordinary Cir-cumstances of Life; but shews it self sufficient-ly in all great Enterprises that require it.  it is true, the General upon the Rhine hath not had the same Occasions as the others to signa-lize himself; but if we consider the great gilance, Activity and Courage, with the con-summate Prudence, and the nice sense of Ho-nour which appears in that Prince Chara-cter, we have great reason to hope, that as he purchased the first Success in the pre-sent War, by forcing into the Service of the Confederates an Army that was raised against them in the very Heart of the Empire, he will give one of the finishing Strokes to it, and help to conclude the great Work which he so happily begun. The sudden Check that he gave to the French Army the last Campaign, and the good Order he established in that of the Germans, look like happy Presages of what we may expect from his Conduct. I shall not pretend to give any Character of the Ge-nerals on the Enemy side; but I think we may say this, that in the Eyes of their own Nation they are inferior to several that have formerly commanded the French Armies. If"
"            PREFACE."
"            THE Author of the following Essay has endeavoured to draw into one continued Scheme the whole State of the present War, and the Methods that ap-pear to him the most proper for bringing it to a happy Conclusion."
"            After having considered that the French are the constant and most dangerous Enemies to the British Nation, and that the Danger from them is now greater than ever, and will still in-crease till their present Ʋnion with Spain be broken, he sets forth the several Advantages which this Ʋnion has already given France, and taken from Great Britain, in relation to the West-Indies, the Wollen Manufacture, the Trade of the Levant, and the Naval Power of the Two Nations."
"            He shews how these Advantages will still rise higher after a Peace, notwithstanding our"
"then we have greater Numbers than the French, and at the same time better Generals, it must be our own Fault if we will not reap the Fruit of such Advantages."
"            It would be loss of Time to explain any further our Superiority to the Enemy in Num-bers of Men and Horse. We see plainly that we have the Means in our Hands, and that nothing but the Application of them is want  Let us only consider what use the Ene-my would make of the Advantage we have mentioned if it fell on their side; and is it not very strange that we shou not be as active and industrious for our Security, as they woued certainly be for our Destruction? But before we consider more distinctly the Method we ought to take in the Prosecution of the War, under this particular View, let us reflect a little upon those we have already taken in the Course of it for these six Years past."
"            The Allies after a successful Summer are too apt upon the Strength of it to neglect their Preparations for the ensuing Campaign, while the French leave no Art nor Stratagem untried to fill up the empty Spaces of their Armies, and swell 'em to an equal Bulk with those of the Confederates. By this means our Advantage"
"is lost, and the Fate of Europe brought to a second Decision. It is now become an Obser-vation that we are to expect a very indifferent Year after a very successful one. Blenheim was followed by a Summer that makes no noise in the War. Ramillies, Turin, and Barcelona, were the Parents of our last Campaign. So many dreadful Blows allarmed the Enemy, and raised their whole Country up in Arms. Had we on our side made proportionable Prepara-tions, the War by this time had been brought to a happy Issue. If after having gained the great Victories of Blenheim and Ramillies we had made the same Efforts as we should have done had we lost them, the Power of France could not have withstood us."
"            In the beginning of the Winter we usually get what Intelligence we can of the Force which the Enemy intends to employ in the Campaigns of the succeeding Year, and immediately cast about for a sufficient number of Troops to face them in the Field of Battle. This, I must confess, would be a good Method if we were engaged in a Defensive War. We might maintain our Ground with an equal Number of Forces; but our Business is not only to secure what we are already in Possession of; we are to wrest the"
"whole Spanish Monarchy out of the Hands of the Enemy; and in order to it, to work our Way into the Heart of his Country by dint of Arms. We should therefore put forth all our Strength, and without having any Eye to his Preparations, make the greatest Push that we are able on our own side. We are told that the Enemy at present thinks of raising Three-score Thousand Men for the next Summer; if we regulate our Levies in that View, we do nothing; let us perform our utmost, as they do, and we shall overwhelm 'em with our Multitudes. We have it in our Power at least to be four times as strong as the French, but if Ten Men are in War with Forty, and the latter detatch only an equal Number to the Engagement, what Benefit do they receive from their Superiority?"
"            It seems therefore to be the Business of the Confederates to turn to their Advantage their apparent Odds in Men and Horse; and by that means to out-number the Enemy in all Rencounters and Engagements. For the same Reason it must be for the Interest of the Al-lies to seek all Opportunities of Battle, be-cause all Losses on the opposite side are made up with infinitely more Difficulty than on ours;"
"besides that the French do their Business by lying still, and have no other Concern in the War than to hold fast what they have already got into their Hands."
"            The Miscarriage of the noblest Project that ever was formed in Europe, can be ascribed to nothing else but our want of Numbers in the several Quarters of the War. If our Armies on all sides had begun to busie and insult the Enemy, at the same time that the Forces marched out of Piemont, Toulon had been at present in the Hands of the Duke of Savoy. But could that Prince ever have imagined that the French would have been at liberty to tatch whole Armies against him? Or will it appear credible to Posterity, that in a War carried on by the joint Force of so many po-pulous and powerful Nations, France could send so great a part of its Troops to one Seat of the War, without suffering in any of the rest? Whereas it is well known, that if the Duke of Savoy had continued before Toulon eight Days longer, he had been attacked by an Army of Sixty Thousand Men, which was more than double the Number of his own; and yet the Enemy was strong enough every where else to prevent the Confederates from making any Im-pression"
"upon them. However, let us fall into the right Measures, and we may hope that the Stroke is only deferred. The Duke of Savoy hath secured a Passage into Dauphiny, and if the Allies make such Efforts in all Parts, as we may reasonably expect from them, that Prince may still make himself Master of the French Dominions on the other side of the Rhone."
"            "
"            There is another part of our Conduct which may perhaps deserve to be considered. As soon as we have agreed with the States Gene-ral upon any Augmentation of our Forces, we immediately negotiate with some or other of the German Princes, who are in the same Confederacy, to furnish out our Quota in Mercenaries. This may be doubly prejudicial to the Alliance; First, as it may have an ill Influence on the Resolutions of those Princes in the Diet of the Empire, who may be wil-ling to settle as small a Quota as they can for themselves, that they may have more Troops to hire out; and in the next place, as it may hinder them from contributing the whole Quota which they have settled. This actually happened in the last Campaign, when we are told the Germans excused themselves for their"
"want of Troops upon the Rhine, as having alrea-dy put most of their Forces into the British and Dutch Service. Such an Excuse, indeed, is very unjust, but it would be better to give them no occasion of making it; and on such Occasions to consider what Men are apt to do, as well as what they may do with Reason."
"            It might therefore be for our Advantage that all the Foreign Troops in the British Pay shoued be raised in Neutral Countries. Switzerland in particular, if timely applied to, might be of great use to us; not only in respect of the Reinforcements which we might draw from thence, but because such a Draught of Forces would lessen the Number of those that might otherwise be employed in the French Service. The Bulk of our Levies shoued nevertheless be raised in our own Country, it being impossible for the Neutral States to furnish both the Bri-tish and Dutch with a sufficient Number of effective Men; besides that the British Sol-diers will be more at the Disposal of their Ge-neral, and act with greater Vigour under the Conduct of one for whom they have so just a Value, and whom they do not consider only as their Leader, but as their Country-Man."
"We may likewise suppose that the Soldiers of a Neutral State, who are not animated by any National Interest, cannot fight for Pay with the same Ardour and Alacrity, as Men that fight for their Prince and Country, their Wives and Children."
"            It may likewise be worth while to consider whether the Military Genius of the English Nation may not fall by degrees, and become inferior to that of our neighbouring States, if it hath no occasion to exert it self. Minds that are altogether set on Trade and Profit, often contract a certain Narrowness of Tem-per, and at length become uncapable of great and generous Resolutions. Shoued the French ever make an unexpected Descent upon us, we might want Soldiers of our own Growth to rise up in our Defence; and might not have time to draw a sufficient Number of Troops to our Relief from the remote Corners of Germany. It is generally said, that if King Charles  had made War upon France in the beginning of his Reign, he might have conquered it by the many Veterans which were scattered up and down this Kingdom, and had been inured to Service in the Civil Wars. It is to be hoped we shall never have such another Nur-sery"
"of Soldiers; but if the present War gives a more Military Turn to all other Nations of Europe, than to our own, it is to be feared we may lose in Strength, what we gain in Number. We may apply the same Con-sideration nearer home. If all our Levies are made in Scotland or Ireland, may not those two Parts of the British Monarchy, af-ter the disbanding of the present Army, be too powerful for the rest, in case of a Re-volt, though , God be thanked, we are not in any danger of one at present. However, as these Considerations don concern the more essential part of our Design, it is sufficient have mentioned them."
"            The sparing of our selves in so important a Conjuncture, when we have but this single Opportunity left for the preserving every thing that is pretious amongst us, is the worst sort of Management that we can possibly fall into. The good Husbandry of one Age may intail an endless Expence upon all Posterity. We must venture the sacrificing a part of our Lives and Fortunes at present, if we will effectually se-cure both for the future. The British King-dom is so well stocked with People, and so much abounds in Horse, that we have Power"
"enough in our own Hands, did we make our utmost use of it, to humble France, and in a Campaign or two to put an end to the War."
"            There is not a more disagreeable Thought to the People of Great Britain than that of a standing Army. But if a Peace be made be-fore the Disunion of France and Spain, there are few, perhaps, that will not think the maintaining a settled Body of numerous Forces indispensable for the Safety of our Country. We have it therefore in our Choice to raise such a strong Reinforcement of Troops as at present may be sufficient in Conjunction with those of the Allies, for breaking the Strength of the Enemy; or when the Peace is conclu-ded, to keep on Foot such an Army as will be necessary for preventing his Attempts up-on us."
"            It is to be hoped that those who woued be the most zealous against keeping up a con-stant Body of Regular Troops after a Gene-ral Peace, will the most distinguish themselves for the promoting an Augmentation of those which are now on Foot; and by that means take care that we shall not stand in need of such an Expedient."
"            "
"               "
"We are indeed obliged by the present Situation of our Affairs to bring more Troops into the Field than we have yet done. As the French are retired within their Lines, and have collected all their Strength into a narrow Compass, we must have greater Numbers to charge them in their Entrench-ments, and force them to a Battle. We saw the last Campaign that an Army of Fourscore Thousand of the best Troops in Europe, with the Duke of Marlborough at the Head of them, coued do nothing against an Enemy that were too numerous to be assaulted in their Camps, or attacked in their Strong Holds."
"            There is another Consideration which serves our utmost Attention. We know very well, that there is a Prince at the Head of a powerful Army, who may give a turn to the War, in which we are engaged, if he thinks fit to side with either Party. I cannot pre-sume to guess how far our Ministers may be informed of his Designs: But unless they have very strong Assurances of his falling in with the Grand Alliance, or not opposing it; they cannot be too circumspect and speedy in taking their Precautions against any contrary Resolution. We shall be unpardonable, if"
"present Conquests, with new Additions, shoued be confirmed to us; as well because the Mo-narchy of Spain woued not be weakened by such Concessions, as because no Guarantee coued be found sufficient to secure them to us. For which Reasons he lays it down as a fixt Rule, That no Peace is to be made without an entire Disunion of the French and Spanish Monarchies."
"            That this may be brought about he endea-vours to prove from the Progress we have al-ready made towards it, and the Successes we have purchased in the present War, which are very considerable if well pursued, but of no effect if we acquiesce in them."
"            In order to compleat this Disunion in which we have gone so far, he woued not have us relie upon exhausting the French Treasury, at-tempts on the Spanish Indies, Descents on France, but chiefly upon out-numbring them in Troops, France being already drained of her best Supplies, and the Confederates Masters of much greater Forces for Multitude and Strength, both in Men and Horse, and provided with Generals of greater Fame and Abilities."
"            "
"               "
"after such an Expence of Blood and Treasure, we leave it in the power of any single Prince to command a Peace, and make us accept what Conditions he thinks fit. It is certain, according to the Posture of our Affairs in the last Campaign, this Prince could have turned the Ballance on either side; but it is to be hoped the Liberties of Europe will not pend any more on the Determination of one Man Will. I don speak this because I think there is any Appearance of that Prince uniting himself to France. On the contrary, as he hath an extraordinary Zeal for the Re-formed Religion, and great Sentiments of Ho-nour, I think it is not improbable we shoued draw him over to the Confederacy, if we press him to it by proper Motives. His Love for Religion, and his Sense of Glory, will both have their effect on a Prince who hath already distinguished himself by being a Patron of Pro-testants, and Guarantee of the Westphalian Treaty. And if his Interest hath any part in his Actions, the Allies may make him greater Offers than the French King can do in the pre-sent Conjuncture. There are large Extents of Dominion in the forfeited Principalities of the Empire; doubtful Successions to which"
"the King of Sweden seems to have very just Pretensions; and at the same time a great Title not yet disposed of, and a Seat of War on the Moselle, where none of our Generals have signalized themselves. It would be Pre-sumption to be particular in any Proposals on such an Occasion; it is enough to have shewn in general, that there are fair Opportunies, of which the Wisdom of the Confederates may make use."
"            Common Sense will direct us, when we see so warlike a Prince at the Head of so great an Army hovering on the Borders of our Con-federates, either to obtain his Friendship, or secure ourselves against the Force of his Arms. We are sure, whatever numbers of Troops we raise, we shall have no Hands but what will turn to account. Nay, we are certain, that extraordinary Funds and Augmentations for one or two Campaigns may spare us the Expence of many Years, and put an end to Taxes and Levies for a whole Age; whereas a long parcimonious War will drain us of more Men and Money, and in the end may prove ineffectual."
"            There is still a great Popular Objection, which will be made to every thing that can"
"be urged on this Subject. And indeed  it is such a one as falls so much in with the Pre-judices and little Passions of the Multitude, that when it is turned and set off to advan-tage by ill-designing Men, it throws a Damp on the publick Spirit of the Nation, and gives a check to all generous Resolutions for its Honour and Safety. In short, we are to be told, that England contributes much more than any other of the Allies, and that there-fore it is not reasonable she shoued make any Addition to her present Efforts. If this were true in Fact, I don see any tolerable colour for such a Conclusion. Supposing among a Multitude embarqued in the same Vessel there are several that in the fury of a Tempest will rather perish than work for their Pre-servation; woued it not be Madness in the rest to stand idle, and rather chuse to sink to-gether than do more than comes to their share? Since we are engaged in a Work so absolutely necessary for our Welfare, the Remisness of our Allies should be an Argument for us to redouble our Endeavours rather than slacken them. If we must govern our selves by Example, let us rather imitate the Vigilance and Activity of the Common Enemy, than"
"the Supineness and Negligence of our Friends."
"            We have indeed a much greater share in the War than any other part of the Confederacy. The French King makes at us directly, keeps a King by him to set over us, and hath very lately augmented the Salary of his Court, to let us see how much he hath that Design at heart. Few of the Nations in War with him, shoued they ever fall into his hands, woued lose their Religion or Form of Govern-ment, or interfere at present with him in matters of Commerce. The Dutch, who are likely to be the greatest Losers after the Bri-tains, have but little Trade to the Levant in comparison with ours, have no considerable Plantations or Commerce in the West-Indies, or any Woollen-Manufactures for Spain; not to mention the strong Barrier they have al-ready purchased between France and their own Country."
"            But after all, every Nation in the Confe-deracy makes the same Complaint, and fancys itself the greatest Sufferer by the War. Indeed in so common a Pressure, let the Weight be never so equally distributed, eve-ry one will be most sensible of that part which lies on his own Shoulders. We fur-nish,"
"without dispute, more than any other Branch of the Alliance: but the question is, whether others do not exert themselves in pro-portion according to their respective Strength. The Emperor, the King of Prussia, the Ele-ctor of Hannover, as well as the States of Holland and the Duke of Savoy, seem at least to come up to us. The greatest Powers in Germany are borrowing Mony where they can get it, in order to maintain their stated Quota  and go thorough their part of the Ex-pence: and  any of the Circles have been negligent, they have paid for it much more in their late Contributions, than what woued have furnished out their Share in the common Charges of the War."
"            There are others who will object the Po-verty of the Nation, and the Difficulties it woued find in furnishing greater Supplies to the War than it doth at present. To this we might answer, that if the Nation were really as poor as this Objection makes it, it shoued be an Argument for enforcing rather than diminishing our present Efforts against France. The sinking our Taxes for a few Years woued be only a temporary Relief, and in a little time occasion far greater Imposi-tions,"
"than those which are now laid upon us. Whereas the seasonable Expence of part of our Riches, will not only preserve the rest; but by the right use of them pro-cure vast Additions to our present Stock. It may be necessary for a Person languishing un-der an ill Habit of Body to lose several Oun-ces of Blood, notwithstanding it will weaken him for a time, in order to put a new Fer-ment into the remaining Mass, and draw into it fresh Supplies."
"            But we can by no means make this Con-cession, to those who so industriously publish the Nation Poverty. Our Country is not only rich, but abounds in Wealth much more than any other of the same Extent in Europe-France, notwithstanding the Goodness of its Climate, the Fertility of its Soil, the Multi-tude of its Inhabitants, its convenient Har-bours, both for the Ocean and Mediterranean, and its present Correspondence with the West-Indies, is not to compare with Great Britain in this particular. I shall transcribe word for word the Passage of a late celebrated French Author, which will lay this Matter in its full light; and leave the Reader to make the counter-part of the Parallel between the two Nations."

"               According to all the Inquiries that I have been able to make during several Years, in which I have applyed my self to this sort of Remarks, I have observed, that about a Tenth part of the People of this King-dom are reduced to Beggary, and are a-ctual Beggars. That among the Nine other parts, Five are not in a condition to give Alms or Relief to those aforementioned, being very near reduced themselves to the same miserable Condition. Of the Four other remaining Parts, Three are very uneasy in their Circumstances, and embarassed with Debts and Law-Suits. In the Tenth part, I reckon the Soldiers, Lawyers, Ecclesiasticks, Merchants and substantial Citizens, which cannot make up more than a Hundred Thousand Fami-lies. And I believe I should not be mistaken, if I shoued say, that there are not above Ten Thousand of these Families, who are very much at their ease: and if out of these Ten Thousand we shoued take the Men that are employed in Publick Busi-ness, with their Dependents and Adhe-rents, as also those whom the King sup-ports by his Bounty, with a few Mer-chants,

the number of those who remain will be surprisingly little. "

How can we see such a Multitude of Souls cast under so many Subdivisions of Misery, without re-flecting on the Absurdity of a Form of Go-vernment that sacrifices the Ease and Happiness of so many reasonable Beings to the Glory of one of their Fellow-Creatures. But this is not our Affair at present."
"            If we run over the other Nations of Eu-rope that have any part in the present War, we shall only pass through so many different Scenes of Poverty. Spain, Portugal, and Savoy are reduced to great Extremities. Ger-many is exhausted to the last degree in many parts of it, and in others plundered of all she had left. Holland indeed flourishes a-bove the rest in Wealth and Plenty: But if we consider the infinite Industry and Penuri-ousness of that People, the Coarseness of their Food and Raiment, their little Indulgences of Pleasure and Excess, it is no wonder that not-withstanding they furnish as great Taxes as their Neighbours, they make a better figure"
"under them. In a Commonwealth there are not so many overgrown Estates as in Monar-chies, the Wealth of the Country is so equal-ly distributed, that most of the Community are at their Ease, though few are placed in extraordinary Points of Splendour and Magni-ficence. But notwithstanding these Circum-cumstances may very much contribute to the seeming Prosperity of the "
"                  Ʋnited Provinces, we know they are indebted many Millions more than their whole Republick is worth, and if we consider the variety of Taxes and Impositions they groan under at a time when their private Dissensions run high, and some of the wealthiest parts of the Government re-fuse to bear their share in the publick Expence, we shall not think the Condition of that Peo-ple so much to be envied as some amongst us would willingly represent it."
"            Nor is Great Britain only rich as she stands in comparison with other States, but is really so in her own intrinsick Wealth. She had never more Ships at Sea, greater quantities of Merchandise in her Warehouses, larger Re-ceipts of Customes, or more numerous Com-modities rising out of her Manufactures than she has at present. In short, she sits in the"
"midst of a mighty Affluence of all the Neces-saries and Conveniencies of Life. If our Sil-ver and Gold diminishes, our publick Credit continues unimpaired, and if we are in want of Bullion, it lies in our own power to sup-ply our selves. The old Roman General, when he heard his Army complain of Thirst, shewed 'em the Springs and Rivers that lay be-hind the Enemy Camp. It is our own case: The Rout of a Spanish Army would make us Masters of the Indies."

The Silesian Fund (to the immortal Reputation of those generous Patriots who were concerned in it) enabled that Prince to make a Conquest of Italy, at a time when our Affairs were more desperate there, than they are at present in the Kingdom of Spain."

We see the Necessity of an Augmentation if we intend to bring the Enemy to Reason, or rescue our Country from the Miseries that may befal it; and we find our selves in a condition of making such an Aug-mentation as, by the Blessing of God, can-not but prove effectual. If we carry it on vigorously we shall gain for our selves and our Posterity a long a glorious and a lasting Peace; but if we neglect so fair an Opportunity, we may be willing to employ all our Hands, and all our Treasures when it will be too late, and shall be tormented with one of the most me-lancholy Reflexions of an afflicted Heart, That it was once in our Power to have made our selves and our Children happy."

"            THE French are certainly the most im-placable, and the most dangerous nemys of the British Nation. Their Form of Government, their Religion, their Jealousy of the British Power, as well as their Prosecutions of Commerce, and Pur-suits"
"of Universal Monarchy, will fix them for ever in their Animosities and Aversions towards us, and make them catch at all Opportunities of subverting our Constitu  destroying our Religion, ruining our Trade, and sinking the Figure which we make among the Nations of Europe: Not to mention the particular Ties of Honour that lie on their present King to impose on us a Prince, who must prove fatal to our Coun-try if he ever reigns over us."
"            As we are thus in a natural State of War, if I may so call it, with the French Nation; it is our Misfortune, that they are not only the most inveterate, but most formidable of our Enemies; and have the greatest Power, as well as the strongest Inclination to ruin us. No other State equals them in the Force of their Fleets and Armies, in the Nearness and Conveniency of their Situation, and in the Number of Friends and Well-wishers, which, it is to be feared, they have among us."
"            For these Reasons our Wars with France have always affected us in our most tender Interests, and concerned us more than those we have had with any other Nation; but I"
"may venture to say, This Kingdom was ne-ver yet engaged in a War of so great con-sequence, as that which now lies upon our hands. Our All is at stake, and irretrie-vably lost, if we fail of Success. At other times, if a War ended in a dishonourable Peace, or with equal Loss, we coued com-fort our selves with the hopes of a more favourable Juncture, that might set the Bal-lance right, or turn it to our Advantage. We had still the prospect of forming the same Alliance, or perhaps strengthning it with new Confederacies, and by that means of trying our Fortune a second time, in case the Injustice or Ambition of the Enemy forced us into the Field. At present, if we make a Drawn Game of it, or procure but Mode-rate advantages, we are in a Condition which every British Heart must tremble at the thought of. There are no second Tri-als, no Wars in reserve, no new Schemes of Alliance to which we can have recourse. Should the French King be able to bear down such an united Force as now makes head against him, at a time when Spain af-fords him no greater Assistance; what will he do when the Trade of the Levant lies at"
