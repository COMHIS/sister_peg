" Tell him the Fight of Thousands we demand;
                Or else Possession of his hilly Land.
            
            
               The Sovereign sitting in his Hall was found,
               The grave Companions of his Youth around;
               For the young Heroes, Thunderbolts of War,
               Were at the Chace, or in the Desart far.
               The Sages told what other Times had seen,
               And what their Deeds in earlier Days had been:
               When Narthmor, King of streamy Lora came,
               Strong, though  in Years, and of illustrious Name.
                This is no Time, began the Chief, to hear"
"                The Song of other Days, the Foe so near;
                Fierce Erragon advances on the Strand,"
"                And lifts ten thousand Swords against the Land;
                Among his Chiefs he stalks with gloomy Pace,"
"                Like the dark Moon when Meteors shroud her Face."
"            "
"            "
"                Come Daughter of my Love, then said Fingal,"
"               "
"                Bosmina come from thy sequestered Hall.
                The rough War threatens; be it thine to save"
"                The Land from Blood, the Soldier from the Grave.
                To gallant Erragon this Message bear,"
"                Say, we for him the festal Board prepare;"
"                The Peace of Heroes we request; and say,
                The Wealth of Aldo at his Feet we lay;"
"                Take thou the Stranger Steeds,—they are not slow,
                Narthmor, and with the Maid of Morven go."
"                Bosmina haste, our Youths are distant far,
                And bending Age unequal is to War.
            
            
               

               To Sora gazing Bands Bosmina bright
               Shone forth, as on a Cloud a Beam of Light;
               Her left Hand with a sparkling Shell was graced,
               A Golden Arrow in her Right was placed.
               As when the Solar Rays a Passage find,
               through  envious Clouds, rent by the rising Wind,
               The Vale rejoices in the genial Heat,
               Smiling the King advanced the Maid to meet.
            
            
               Thus, mildly blushing, she began to speak,
                Thy Royal Presence we in Selma seek;"
"                For thee the Feast is spread by Morven King;
                I'll be thy Guide, provided Peace you bring."
"                Listen, famed Warrior, then to our Request,
                Of Peace accept, and let the dark Sword rest."
"                The Wealth of Kings we offer, if you chuse;
                Nor you to hear what Aldo says refuse."
"                An hundred Steeds he gives that own the Rein,
                Never a swifter Race devoured the Plain."
"                An hundred Maids from distant Lands he gives,
                Beneath the Sky not brighter Beauty lives."
"                An hundred Hawks, all well inured to Game,
                Of which none Haggard, ever missed their Aim."
"                An hundred Girdles also shall be thine;
                Such when they round high-bosomed Women twine,"
"                Gives sudden Ease to Travails' fiercest Throes,
                And their vast Virtue every Matron knows."
"                Ten Shells with Gems inlaid, which ours we call,
                Shall Lustre beam through  Sora lofty Hall;"
"               "
"                  "
" Trembling upon their Stars, blue Waters shine,
                And to the Eye appear like sparkling Wine."
"                The World great Kings, Lords of the distant Seas,
                Once quaffed delicious Beverage from these."
"                They all are thine;—or Lorma fair shall grace,
                Thy Tower again, and pant in thy Embrace."
"                though  much Fingal the gen'rous Aldo loves,
                Thus Erragon, his Wish for Peace he proves;"
"                Fingal, who never did a Hero wrong,
                Never Injustice, though  his Arm be strong.
            
            
                Soft Voice of Cona, Sora King replyed,
                Tell him he does in vain the Feast provide,"
"                Unless he bow to my superior Sway,
                And at my Feet his Spoils submissive lay;"
"                The Shields of other Times let him resign,
                And let me all his Fathers Swords call mine;"
"               "
"                These, in my Hall, so shall my Sons behold,
                And say, those Arms were once Fingal the bold."
"            "
"            "
"                Never shall they behold them in thy Hall;
                Never so low shall Morven Monarch fall;"
"                Still are they grasped by the firm Hand of Might,
                By Heroes who ne'er yielded in the Fight.
               
                  Bosmina spoke, by Patriot Pride alarmed,
               And kindling Passion all her Visage warmed.
                King of re-ecchoing Sora, too, she said,
                Thou art to Death by this thy Pride betrayed;"
"                For on our Hills the Storms begin to lower,
                Which must thy numerous Ranks and thee devour.
            
            
               

               Now Selma towering Walls Bosmina sought,
               Silent she went, and Fingal read her Thought.
               In Strength he rose, his Silver Locks he shook;
               The sounding Mail of Trenmor then he took,
               His Father Shield.—Darkness er Selma spread,
               When on his Spear his out-stretched Hand he laid.
               Myriads of howling Ghosts around were heard,
               And many a gallant Hero Fall was feared.
               Stern Joy in each old Warrior Visage glows,
               While on they pressed to meet their Country Foes;
               The Feats of former Times their Minds employ,
               The Fame which those who fall in War enjoy.
               When, lo! the panting Dogs upon the Plain,
               Were seen, where Trathail long in Dust had lain.
               
                  Fingal then knew his youthful Heroes near,
               And stopt the Thunder of his bold Career.
            
            
               First Oscar,—Morni Son,—and Nemis' Race,
               Then Fercuth shewed his cloudy Form and Face;
               
                  Dermid, his dark Hair sporting in the Wind,
               And Ossian last,  Stranger, came behind;
               Propt by my Spear, I leapt each little Stream,
               And sung,—old Times and Actions past my Theme;
               Of mighty Men I thought,—when near at Hand,
               War dismal Din was ecchoed through  the Land;
               For hardy Fingal struck his bossy Shield,
               A thousand Swords unsheathed wave er the Field;
               Three grey-haired Sons of Song then lift the Voice
               Of Harmony; a mournful Theme their Choice.
               
                  

With sounding Step, in youthful Prowess strong,
               Tremendous to the View, we rushed along;
               So pours impetuous through  the narrow Vale,
               The drifting Storm of Sleet, and driving Hail.
            
            
               On the green Hill Fingal now sat reclined,
               His glittering Standard fluttered in the Wind;
               The tough Companions of his Youth were near,
               Graceful their waving Locks of Age appear.
               Now he beheld his Sons in War arise,
               And heart-felt Pleasure sparkled in his Eyes;
               For, midst the Lightning of their Swords, he saw,
               From their Forefathers Deeds they took their Law.
            
            
               Like the fierce Torrent of a Wintry Night,
               Stout Erragon advanced, of matchless Might,
               Death tracked his Footsteps, wheresoe'er he came,
               The Ranks were thined, as Heath consumed by Flame.
                Who, says Fingal, comes like the bounding Roe?"
"                The Hart which we in ecchoing Cona know?
                His bright Shield glitters on his manly Side,"
"                His Armor clangs, but mournful is his Pride.
                He meets with Erragon!—How big the Strife!—"
"                The Battle of the Chiefs!—they toil for Life!—
                So when in Air high rules the Tempest Rage,"
"                In Combat fierce appalling Ghosts engage.
                Son of the Hill, thou fall'st, distained with Blood;"
"                From thy white Bosom streams Life crimson Flood.
                Ah! hapless Lorma, thy hard Fate deplore;"
"                Weep, wretched Woman, Aldo is no more."
"            "
"            "
"               "
"               The Hero Spear the King of Sora took,"
"               And on his Body cast a pitying Look;"
"               Round on the Foe his deathful Eyes then threw,"
"               When Gaul came forth, to Virtue ever true."
"               Who can the Conflict of the Heroes tell?"
"               Their wonderous Deeds!—the royal Stranger fell."
"                Sons of loved Cona, loud brave Fingal cried,"
"                Hold Death red Hand, and stop the purple Tide.
                For ah! the Great his last in Dust has groaned,"
"                And much in Sora is his Fall bemoaned.
                The Traveller shall to his Hall repair,"
"                And wonder at the Silence reigning there;
                Stranger, the King is levelled with the Dust!"
"                His House Joy;—Who in their Strength may trust!
                Hark!—a shrill Voice! quick through  his Woods it passed,"
"                Perhaps his Spirit that bestrides the Blast.
                But he is distant far,—on Morven, low"
"                Fell Erragon beneath a foreign Foe."
"            "
"            "
"               Thus spoke Fingal; the tuneful Song of Peace"
"               The Bard raised high,—the Swords from Slaughter cease."
"               The feeble Foe was spared for better Days,"
"               While added Glories round the The Standard of Fingal was called the Sunbeam, from its being richly adorned with Jewels.Sunbeam blaze."
"               Within that Tomb the conquered Chief we laid,"
"               And I the Song of Lamentation made."
"               Oft er the Sky, when Night dark Vapours come,"
"               The Hero mourning Ghost appears to some;"
"               "
"                  "
"Pale Sorrow, say they, on his Face impressed,"
"               And half-formed Sighs seem labouring in his Breast."
"               Blest Sora King, be thy departed Soul,"
"               Thine Arm the Tide of Battle could controul."
"            "
"            "
"               Fair Lorma sat, and fast descended Night,"
"               through  Aldo Hall; a flaming Oak gave Light."
"               With Expectation big her Bosom burned,"
"               Sad she looked out, but saw him not returned."
"            "
"            "
"                Where can my Joy, my Comfort, thus remain?
                Cona loved Hunter! what can thee detain?"
"                You promised to return er setting Day,
                Has then the Deer been distant far away?"
"                Do the bleak Winds sigh round thee on the Heath,
                Where murmuring Spirits guard their Bones beneath?"
"                Where is my Friend? Where, where my Aldo gone?
                Wherefore am I with Strangers left alone?"
"                My Aldo never yet neglectful proved!
                Come from thy ecchoing Hills, my best beloved.
            
            
               Oft to the Gate she turns her swimming Eyes;
               Oft listens as the rustling Breezes rise;—
                it is Aldo Tread;—Joy lightens in her Face.—
               It is not he!—How short the smiling Space.
               Now anxious Thoughts again her Visage shroud,
               As the pale Moon behind a watery Cloud.
                Return, my Love, nor thus my Hopes defraud,—"
"                Return, my Love.—Again I'll look abroad.
                Soft in the East the Queen of Stars is bright,"
"                And the calm Lake reflects her Silver Light.
               
                  

 Shall I not see his faithful Dogs appear?"
"                His faithful Dogs would tell my Hero near.
                When shall his well-known Accents, on the Wind,"
"                though  distant, loud, revive my pensive Mind?
                Come from thy towering Hills,—my Love, appear;—"
"                Thy Lorma calls;—he silent—much I fear!—"
"            "
"            "
"               As when a Midnight Shower invests the Plain,"
"               The Moon a dusky Beam darts through  the Rain;"
"               His shivering Ghost upon a Rock was seen,"
"               The Shade she followed er the gloomy Green;"
"               For now she knew the Hero was no more;"
"               I heard her in the Wind her Fate deplore:"
"               I heard her Mourning, like the Gales that pass"
"               Over yon Cave, that sigh among the Grass."
"               She came, she found the Spot where Aldo lay,"
"               Her Voice grew faint, and gradual died away:"
"               Pale as the Vapor rising er the Lake,"
"               She rolled her heavy Eyes, nor more she spake."
"               Few were her Days in Cona, when she died,"
"               And Beauty Blossom withered in its Pride."
"            "
"            "
"               "
"                  Fingal commanded, and his Bards proclaim,"
"               In melancholy Song her deathless Fame."
"               "
"                  Morven fair Daughters, once in every Year,"
"               Drop er her Clay-cold Grave a pitying Tear,"
"               When Autumn Blasts upon the Hills appear."
"            "
"            "
"               Son of the Land, far distant from our own,"
"               Whose Dwelling is the Field of fair Renown,"
"               "
"                  "
"O let thy Song be sometimes tuned to those"
"               Who fell in Battle; thence their Fame arose."
"               So their thin Ghosts around thee shall rejoice,"
"               And on a Moon-beam Lorma hear thy Voice;"
"               When in thy Cave thou lay'st thee down by Night,"
"               Thou shalt behold her in the humid Light,"
"               And thou wilt own, that she indeed was fair,"
"               though  wet her Cheek, and wan her Face with Care."

"               MORAR. A FRAGMENT."
"               "
"                  THE Rain dispersed, the Storm of Wind is past,"
"                  No more I shiver in the dreary Blast."
"                  Calm is the Noon. The burning Lamp of Day"
"                  From Hill to Hill pursues his circling Way;"
"                  A rising Rain-bow bends across the Skies,"
"                  And fleecy Clouds display their varying Dies;"
"                  Red pours the sudden Stream er yonder Steep,"
"                  And through  the Valley spreads with murm'ring Sweep:"
"                  How softly plaintive sounds it on mine Ear,"

"                  Say, Son of Song, why on the silent Hill,"
"                  These lonely Bounds thy sad Complainings fill?"
"                  Why, like the Wave upon the desart Shore,"
"                  Or Blasts through  wintry Woods do'st thou thy Fate deplore?"

"               FINGAL, King of Morven, returning Home vic-torious from the Expedition in Ireland, which is ce-lebrated in the Epic Poem bearing his Name, made a Feast, to which all his Chiefs, Ma-ronnan and Aldo ex-cepted, were invited. The Neglect seems to have been accidental; however they resented it so strongly as to aban-don their native Country, and enter into the Service of Erragon, King of Sora, a Name given to some Part of Scandinavia. Here Lorma, the beautiful Wife of Erragon, seeing Aldo by chance, his Reputation as a Warrior being very high, fell in Love with him. He returned her Pas-sion, and they fled into Morven. Erragon pursuing them, invaded that Kingdon with a powerful Force, and slew Aldo in single Combat, but was himself slain by Gaul, the Son of Morni, and his Army defeated. This is the Sub-ject of the ensuing Poem, which is beautiful, sentimental, and interesting. It was delivered by Ossian, after becom blind, to a Culdee, or Christian Hermit, who led a recluse Life near him, and whose Sacred Hymns he ima-gined were composed in Honour of his deceased Chiefs, or Addresses to the Spirits in the Air."
