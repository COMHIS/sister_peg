"                  Innes' visio-onary argu-ment Innes endeavours to support this branch of his system with other arguments. The Romans, says the ingenious wri-ter, after the conquest of Gaul found means to confine the Germans within their own territories. Being overstocked with numbers at home, they were obliged to put to sea, and try their fortune beyond the pale of the empire. The Germans, touching on the opposite shore of North Britain, were probably repulsed by the bravery of the Caledonians, upon which they steered their course to Ireland, and made a conquest of that country."
"               "
"               "
"                  from the population of Germany The legions of Rome it is certain frus-trated, for some time, the attempts which the Germans made to extend themselves towards the South. In the reign of Augustus they crossed the Rhine without success, and in that of Vespasian they aided, to no purpose, the rebellion of Claudius Civilis. When Domitian held the reins of government at Rome, the Germans attempted the conquest of Gaul, and they gave much trouble to many of his successors in the imperial dignity. The Romans, says Cornelius Tacitus"
"                     Proximis temporibus triumphati magis quam victi. Tacit. Mor. Germ. cap. 37."
"                     "
"                  , rather triumphed over, than subdued, the Germans; the victories which the impe-rial armies gained in their country being"
"attended with more glory than any solid advantage. To prevent the incursions of enemies so formidable, the Romans had recourse to political expedients to weaken their power at home. Both Augustus and Tiberius concluded treaties with the Suevi and Sicambri, and transplanted them into the fertile provinces of Gaul."
"               "
"                  confuted. It does not appear that Germany was verstocked with numbers, after the Roman legions had excluded their migrating ar-mies from Gaul. In the attempts of the Germans upon that country, in the reign of Augustus, they lost a great number of their bravest soldiers; and the expeditions of Drusus depopulated whole districts of their country. Tiberius was not less successful in Germany than his brother Drusus, nor his many victories less structive to the inhabitants of that coun-try"
"                     Velleius Paterculus,  i."
"                  . After his accession to the imperial dignity, his nephew Germanicus, with eight legions supported by auxiliaries, ra-vaged all that tract of country, which lies between the Rhine and the Elbe, and made a general massacre of the whole nation of the Marsi. Germany, during that fatal period, was involved in civil wars. The ill-timed animosities between Arminius and Segestes, the ravages of Maroboduus,"
"and the invasion of the Romans, made it a scene of unparalleled miseries. It is therefore certain that Germany, in the first century, was more depopulated, than it was in any former or after period, if we except the time in which the Franks, Allemans, and Lombards, evacuated their territories to settle themselves in more fertile countriesIt must be confessed that several tribes in the North-East angle of Scotland have preserved in their traditions, and the genealogical histories of their fami-lies, pretensions to a German origin. The Clancattin, or the tribe of Catti, consisting of a great variety of branches, the most numerous of which are the Mac-phersans, Mackintoshes, and Sutherlands, affirm, with one consent, that the famous Catti of ancient Ger-many were their ancestors. Though this opinion very probably took its rise from an identity of names, it is far from being unlikely that some Celto-Germanic tribes transmigrated, at different times, into that part of Britain which was not subject to the Romans; but it is morally impossible that a migration, sufficient to people Caledonia and Ireland, could have happened, without falling within the knowledge of the writers of Rome, who certainly extended their enquiries to the transactions of the wild nations on the frontiers of the empire.."
"               "
"                  The Irish descended of the Bri-tish Gaël. It appears, upon the whole, that no colonies came to Ireland either from Spain or the North of Europe, between the commencement of the Christian aera, and the close of the third century, when the Scots are mentioned by Porphyrius for the first time. That the Scots came from either of those countries by a long voyage"
"to Ireland, prior to the first century, is sufficiently contradicted by the known barbarism of the old Hibernians, as well as of all other nations whom an inter-course with the Romans had not huma-nized. We must have recourse, in the last resort, to the Caledonian Britons for the genuine origin of the Irish. Their name of Gaël, their lan-guage, the conformity of their manners and customs with those of the old Britons, all concur in proving, beyond any possi-bility of reply, that the Irish are the posterity of the Gauls or Gaël, who. after having traversed the Island of Great Britain, passed over, in a very early pe-riod, into Ireland from the promontories of Galloway and Cantire."

"               General Reflections."
"               "
"                  General observation. NATIONS find it difficult to divest themselves of a partiality for sys-tems of antiquity, which, to the sanction of ages, have added the authority of learned men. The Scots of both the British Isles were former peculiarly at-tached to the absurd tales, with which their bards had covered their origin. Many still retain the unmanly credulity, which has been the reproach of their ancestors, and think it a kind of sacri-lege to disperse the gloom, which involves the commencements of their history. The Author of the Introduction writes not for these; he has taken up arms against fiction and romance, and he will not lay them down till the whole are subdued. In destroying the fantastic fables, which deform the obscurity of our ancient his-tory, he may perhaps bury whole ages in darkness; but oblivion itself is better than inauthentic fame. The credit of the Milesian tale is already destroyed, and it is perhaps superfluous to refute the pre-tended Hibernian extraction of the Scots"
"Both stories depend upon the same autho-rity, and they must both fall by the same argument. But to close for ever a contest, which, though not material in itself, has employed the pens of many learned men, and attracted the attention of nations, we must discuss the point at more length than its importance deserves."
"               "
"                  Nothing known of the Irish be-fore St. Pa-trick. It has already appeared that nothing certain is known concerning the affairs of Ireland prior to the mission of St. Patrick"

"                  . The history of Caledonia, before the Roman eagles were displayed beyond the friths, must for ever remain in impenetrable darkness. Both countries were peopled many ages before the reign of Domitian, but how they were governed, or by what petty chieftains or kings, a Scottish or Irish Berosus can only tell. Had a hundred Hibernian colonies, with a royal Milesian at the head of each, transmigrated into North Britain, before the Roman arms penetrated into Caledo-nia, they must, without a revelation from heaven, remain involved in eternal ob-livion."
"It is as ridiculous to assert, as it would be downright anility to believe, that Caledonia received an Irish colony before Tacitus wrote the life of Agricola. To prove that no Irish colony transmi-grated into Britain in or after the reign of Domitian, it is proper to review what the Romans have communicated concern the state of Caledonia from that period to the appearance of the Scots on the frontiers of the province."

"               The Scots not of Irish Extract."
"               "
"                  No Irish migration happened in the first cen-tury. Julius Agricola employed his fourth campaign in securing the acquisitions which he had made to the south of the Forth and Clyde; and could the bravery of his troops, and the glory of the Ro-man name, permit it, that able comman-der, says Tacitus, might find in those friths a proper boundary for his conquests in Britain"

"                     "
"                  . Agricola, in the fifth year of his expeditions, shipping his army in the Clyde, attacked nations till then un-known, in that part of Caledonia which lies over against Ireland. After several successful engagements he stationed some"
"of his troops there to be in readiness for an Irish expedition"
"                     Eamque partem Britanniae quae Hiberniam aspicit, copiis intravit, in spem magis quam ob formidinem. Tacit. Vit. Agric. xxiv."
"                     "
"                  ."
"               "
"                  First argu-ment. The counties of Dumbarton and Argyle were the theatre of war in Agricola fifth campaign. The inhabitants were so nu-merous, that, for a whole summer, they gave ample employment to the Roman army; and that, at a time, when, by the testimony of Agricola himself"
"                     Saepe ex eo audivi, legione una et modicis auxiliis debellari, obtinerique Hiberniam posse. Tacit. Vit. Agric, xxiv."
"                     "
"                  , a single legion was sufficient not only to subdue, but also to secure the conquest of Ireland."
"               "
"                  Second ar-gument. In vain will it be objected that the Ro-man commander might have been mista-ken in his calculation of the internal strength of Ireland. He had in his camp an Irish prince who was no stranger to the state of his own country. Should it be supposed that this exile, from a desire of inducing Agricola to undertake an expedition, which might re-establish him-self in his dominions, gave a false account of Ireland, the Roman was too prudent to rely altogether on the intelligence of the Hibernian fugitive. The ports of Ireland were, in those times, better known than those of Britain; and Agricola must"
"have consulted those who traded into that country concerning the force of an Island which he intended to invade"
"                     Tacit. Vit. Agric. xxiv."
"                  ."
"               "
"                  Third argu-ment. We may therefore conclude that Agri-cola formed, upon good intelligence, a just idea of the state of Ireland, and con-sequently that it was very thinly peopled, or that the military character of its inha-bitants, on account of their extreme bar-barism, was very low. In either of these situations it is not in any degree probable, that the Irish, in the days of Domitian, would have made any attempts to settle in Caledonia; or that those whom one legion was sufficient to subdue at home, could make conquests abroad, among a people who employed the whole force of the Roman army."
"               "
"                  Fourth ar-gument. It is difficult to ascertain with exactness the number of the troops of Agricola in his Caledonian expedition. Josephus says that there were four legions stationed in Britain in the days of Domitian. We learn from Tacitus, that Agricola, at one period of the Caledonion war, divided his army into three bodies. The enemy at-tacked one of those divisions consisting of the ninth legion, which, according to the established maxim of the Romans, must have been supported by a proportionable"
"number of auxiliaries. Upon the whole we may conclude, that the two counties of Argyle and Dumbarton opposed, for a campaign, thrice the number of troops, that, according to Agricola opinion, was sufficient to conquer the whole kingdom of Ireland."
"               "
"                  Fifth argu-ment. Had there been in the time of Agricola an Hibernian colony settled in the western Caledonia, who had resolution and num-bers sufficient to oppose that great man, it is impossible that their mother coun-try could have been represented by him in so despicable a light. Neither is it probable that Tacitus, in his short account of the Irish nation, where he observes that their genius and manners did not differ materially from the Britons"

"                     "
"                  , would have omitted to say that the western Cale-donians derived their blood from Ireland, had that actually been the case. The celebrated writer, on the contrary, gave it as his opinion, that the Caledonians, in the most extensive sense of that name, and consequently the inhabitants of Argyle and Dumbarton, were of German ex-tract"

"                  Irish fables on the sub-ject. The Irish, upon the authority of those annals whose credit has been already stroyed, affirm that their ancestors, in the days of Agricola, as well as in subsequent periods, were the life and strength of the Caledonian armies"
"                     Flaherty in Ogygia."
"                  . It will, perhaps, be thought unnecessary to confute these unauthorized assertions, after what has been already said concerning the faith due to Irish history before the time of St. Patrick. But to give every advantage to the zealous abetters of the old system, we shall examine this tale without insist on the impossibility that even tradition could extend to Ireland in the first cen-tury."
"               "
"                  Improba-ble. Crimothan the first, it would appear, held the reins of government in Ireland, when Agricola carried the Roman arms into Caledonia. This monarch transported an army into North Britain, aided the Cale-donians against the Romans, and after the departure of Agricola returned to Ire-land laden with spoils and foreign tro-phies. Tacitus was extremely unjust to the happy valour of Crimothan against the Romans. The illustrious Crimothan, the supreme king of Ireland, was, it seems, inferior in command, in birth and valour, to the chieftain who was at the"
"head of the Caledonian confederacy. Tacitus expressly affirms, that Galgacus was superior, in those respects, to all the leaders of that army which fought Agri-cola near the Grampian mountains"
"                     Inter plures duces genere et virtute praestans. Tacit. Vit. Agric. xxix."
"                     "
"                  ."
"               "
"                  Impossible, Is it not somewhat strange, that Gal-gacus has totally neglected to mention his ally Crimothan, and his Hibernian forces, in that excellent speech with which he animated the Caledonian army"
"                     Tacit. Vit. Agric. xxx."
"                  ? And why did not Tacitus place the pro-vocation given by Crimothan among those reasons which Agricola assigned for his intended expedition into Ireland? The celebrated writer, the truth is, knew no-thing of Crimothan or his troops; and therefore we may conclude, that the re-doubtable monarch, if he ever existed, never crossed the Irish channel. It is upon the whole demonstrable, that no part of Caledonia was possessed by an Hibernian colony in the days of Agricola; and that the story of the pretended auxili-aries from Ireland is absolute fiction."
"               "
"                  The Cale-donians suf-fered little from Agri-cola. The losses sustained by the Caledonians during the expedition of Agricola were, perhaps, much exaggerated by Tacitus. But had they suffered even more than the historian affirms, they had time to re-cover"
"their former strength during the long tranquility which succeeded the parture of Agricola, and continued to the reign of Hadrian. The incursions of the Caledonians rendered it necessary for that emperor to come in person into Britain; but that the Barbarians suffered very little loss by his arms we may naturally infer, from his relinquishing to them all that tract of country which extends from the Tine and Solway to the Scottish friths"

But the flattering hopes of Severus vanished into air, after the most vigorous exertions of courage, conduct, and force; after sustaining incredible fatigues with amazing patience, and the loss of fifty thousand men, he was at last reduced to the old and inglorious expedient of build a wall to exclude from the province those Barbarians whom he could neither extirpate or subdue"

The inhabitants of North Britain ceased to be distinguished by the name of Caledonians about the close of the fourth age; so that the Mi-lesian system must have been fabricated in a period so modern as to place the fourth century beyond the reach of tradition. But, by whatever name the northern Britons were distinguished, it is reason-able to suppose that the monarch of Ire-land would have sent auxiliaries to his distressed vassals when Severus threatened the whole nation with extirpation. He-rodian and Dion Cassius then were very unjust to his Hibernian majesty, for nei-ther he or his forces are once mentioned in the minute account given by those historians of the Caledonian war. The Roman writers with one consent seem to have entered into a conspiracy against the military fame of the royal line of Heremon.

In the long period which intervened between the accession of the sons of Se-verus to the imperial dignity, and the middle of the fourth age, the Caledonians were not once attacked within their own territories by the Roman armies. The exploits of Carausius are mere fiction, and the feats of Constantine and his father Chlorus in Caledonia existed only in the rants of ecclesiastical panegyrists. The frequent contests for the purple, between men sometimes called emperors and some-times tyrants and usurpers, in proportion as they were near or far distant from the capital; the public distractions which arose naturally from these disputes, the growing imbecillity of the empire, and the invasions of the Barbarians of the northern Europe, diverted the attention of the Romans from Caledonia. In a"
"period so long, and of such tranquillity, the inhabitants of North Britain, instead of declining, must have greatly multiplied their numbers. In the tenth consulship of Constantius, the son of Constantine, we meet with the Scots, a formidable nation in Britain. Ammianus Marcellinus, who found them first in the island, does not furnish one obscure hint that they derived their blood from a foreign country. The historian, on the contrary, gives to them and the Picts the character of wild nations, plainly in opposition to those Britons whom the Romans had subdued and humanized"

"            "
"               "
"               Proved from various Arguments."
"               "
"                  First argu-ment. Bede is the first writer who positively affirms that the Scots of Britain derived their origin from those of Ireland. Whe-ther they originally obtained from the Picts the principality of Iar-gaël or Ar-gyle by force or treaty, was a point which all his historical and traditional knowledge did not enable the venerable Anglo-Saxon to determine. The incapacity of Bede, who lived so near the pretended transmi-gration of the Irish, to solve this difficulty, is a kind of demonstration that the whole story is a fiction, imposed upon that credulous, though pious writer."
"               "
"                  Second argument. If the Picts were so seeble that a band of Irish adventurers could tear from them one third of their dominions, how came they so frequently to provoke the Roman legions, and harass the provincials from the time of Chlorus to the total dere-liction of Britain by Honorius? To invade the territories of a warlike and disciplined people when they suffered a great part of their own to be wrested from them by a despicable enemy, is a folly too absurd to gain any credit. But perhaps the Picts"
"gave the district of Argyle to their allies of Ireland, in consideration of services against the Romans. These services were extremely unnecessary; for the Romans, till provoked by incursions, were very in-offensive towards the Barbarians beyond the walls. Nations, in short, have been known to receive foreigners into the bosom of their country to repel invasions, but it is ridiculous to think that any people would have recourse to so dangerous an expedient for the pleasure of harrassing neighbours who did not in any degree offend them."
"               "
"                  Third argu-ment. It is difficult for the unprejudiced part of mankind to believe, that a colony, sufficient to occupy the western Highlands and Isles, could have wafted themselves, their wives, and children, at once, from Ireland into the northern Britain, in Cur-raghs or miserable skiffs, whose hulls of wicker were wrapped up in a cow hide. In these wretched vessels, it is true, an irregular communication was kept up be-tween both the Islands; but the naviga was dangerous, and performed only in the fairest days of summer"
"                     Mare quod Britanniam et Hiberniam interluit un-dosum et inquietum, toto in anno non nisi aestivis pau-culis diebus est navigabile. Navigant autem viminiis alveis quos circumdant ambitione tergorum bubulino-rum, Solin. xxxv."
"                     "
"                  . The"
"thought every pursuit not immediately subservient to the profession of arms mean and dishonourable. They little considered that this prejudice was a fatal enemy to the fame which they sought after with so much eagerness in the field. In vain were exploits worthy of memory performed, when the only certain means of transmit-ting them to posterity were discouraged and despised."
"               "
"                  The middle ages In the cloud of ignorance which invol-ved them at home they advanced into the provinces of western empire. Learning, which had long languished among the Romans, expired with the power of that illustrious people; and Europe, in a great measure, returned to its original rudeness and barbarity. When the detached tribes who had subverted the government of the Romans formed themselves into regular communities some knowledge of letters began to revive; but the Christian cler-gy, following the policy of their predeces-sors the Druids, confined that knowledge to themselves."
"               "
"                  unfavour-able to history. To record temporal events was not the first use made of letters by the religious of the middle ages. Miracles, visions, and the lives of saints, were more impor-tant subjects, than the transactions of states and kingdoms, in the eyes of a race of men whose influence depended upon keeping mankind in the shades of igno-rance"
"fertility of the soil of Iar-ghaël could never be an inducement to an Irish mi-gration into that division of Caledonia. If poverty, or their being overstocked with numbers, compelled the inhabitants of the pretended Dalrietta, or the Route in the county of Antrim, to go in quest of foreign settlements, they ought in common prudence to have tried their fortune in the southern division of their own country, and not in the sterile moun-tains of the western Caledonia."
"               "
"                  Fourth ar-gument. The Irish must have been wonderfully improved in military knowledge from the days of Agricola, if it was more difficult in the fourth century to extort part of their dominions from them, than from the Caledonians, who had better oppor-tunies to be enured to arms. Turgesius and his Norwegians did not find, in an after age, that the Irish were so obstinately tenacious of their fertile lands, as the posterity of the Picts were of their own barren country, when repeatedly attacked by all the efforts of Scandinavia."
"               "
"                  Fifth argu-ment. Should it be supposed that a band of adventurers were expelled from Ulster by the pressure of the southern Irish, it is difficult to account how the Picts of Bri-tain should receive the fugitives. Either generosity or selfishness would have prompted them, like the Earl of Pem-broke,"
"to assist the exiles in recovering their territories; and, by that means, to endeavour to conquer a part of a fine country for themselves. But the Picts were, it seems, strangers to the most common maxims of policy; for, accord to the system under consideration, they must have been of all nations the most tame, prodigal, and imprudent. In short, if the Irish Scots voluntarily abandoned one of the best districts of Ireland to set-tle in one of the most sterile divisions of North Britain, they must have been more absurd than the Hibernians of latter ages have been, perhaps very unjustly, repre-sented; if by violence they were driven from home, the Picts deserve the same character for permitting a band of vaga-bonds to seize upon one third of their dominions."
"               "
"                  Sixth argu-ment. The Saxon auxiliaries of Vortigern were not so modest as the Irish Scots; or else the Picts were a people of much less spirit than the southern Britons. When the Saxons raised their demands to an unreasonable height, the Britons disputed with them every inch of ground. They were at last overpowered; but it was after such an expence of time and blood, that glory covered them in the midst of ruin. Had the Hibernian mer-cenaries encroached upon the Picts, as the"
"Saxons did on the Britons, we might naturally suppose that the latter, instead of carrying war and desolation into a foreign country, in conjunction with the Scots, would have found employment for their arms at home. The unanimity in expedition which subsisted for ages be-tween the Caledonian nations, is proof sufficient that they derived their origin from one and the same source."

"               General Reflections."
"               "
"                  First ap-pearance of the Scots. ABOUT the middle of the fourth age, the unconquered barbarians of Caledonia became known to the Ro-mans under the name of Picts and Scots. Marcellinus, who is the first historian who met them in Britain, was an abso-lute stranger to their being a new people, who then made their appearance in the island"
"                     Amm. Marcell.  xx. The very learned and ingenious Dr. Macpherson has, in his critical disserta on the British and Irish Scots, proved against the bishop of St. Asaph, that Ammianus Marcellinus does not furnish even an obscure hint, that the Scots were a new people in Britain, in the reign of Constantius.. In the period of time between the expedition of Julius Agricola and the reign of Constantius we have already seen, that the improbability of the transmigra of a foreign colony into North Bri-tain is so great that, without positive evi-dence, the story can never be believed. The abettors of the Hibernian antiquities,"
"finding that the credit of the domestic annals of Ireland could never establish this fact, had recourse to some passages of foreign writers, which they wrested to their purpose."
"               The impossibility of an Irish migration into North Britain between the reign of Constantius and the dereliction of Britain by Honorius, is supported by arguments equally strong with those we have pro-duced for the period before the first of those emperors. Those who after Con-stantius succeeded to the imperial purple, till the days of Valentinian, were rather insulted than feared by the wild nations of Caledonia. The latter, therefore, were under no necessity to implore the assistance of foreign auxiliaries; neither can we suppose that they would cede to a pitiful band of Irish barbarians any part of those territories, which they defended, with so much spirit, against the disciplined armies of the lords of the world."

"                  Claudian pretended authority The supporters of the Hibernian ex-traction of the British Scots pretend to have found in Claudian a direct proof of their system. That Poet, in his pane-gyric on Theodosius, has the following lines."
"                     Quid rigor aeternus coeli; quid sidera prosunt,"
"                     Ignotumque fretum? Maduerunt Sax-one fuso"

"                        ."
"                   But we may venture to affirm, that there is nothing in this passage conclusive in fa-vour of the old Milesian tale. Claudian indulged all the wantonness of a poetical fancy in this panegyric on Theodosius. It was the poet imagination only that warmed Thule with Pictish blood, moistened the sands of Orkney with Saxon gore, and thawed the frozen Ierne into tears for the slaughter of the Scots."
"                  "
"It is idle, in short, to search for fact in the hyperboles of poetry; Marcellinus, though particularly fond of Theodosius, has not recorded these prodigies of valour: Even Latinus Pacatius, though a pane-gyrist, says no more, than that the Scot was driven back to his native fens"

"                  examined, Without insisting upon what shall here-after appear at least probable, that Ireland is not meant by the Ierne of Claudian, we may aver, that there is nothing in these verses decisive concerning the origin of the Scots. If the Hibernians were of Ca-ledonian extract; if, from the ancient ties of consanguinity, a friendly inter-course was maintained between the Irish and the inhabitants of Albany; a person of a less warm imagination than Claudian might suppose that the former sincerely lamented the misfortunes of their mother nationShould it be admitted that the Scots of Valenti-nian time were skilled in maritime affairs, and had passed from Ireland into North Britain, they ought, after Theodosius had chased them to their vessels, to have directed their flight to their native island. On the contrary, Claudian hero, or rather Claudian himself, pursues them sword in hand, into the Hyperborean ocean."

"                   Britain is here personified; she makes her acknowledgments to Stilicho for his ser-vices to her at a very perilous conjunc-ture. She owed her safety to that able commander when the Scot had put all IERNA in motion; when the ocean was agitated into a foam by hostile oars. He delivered her from the terrors of a Scot-tish war, from Pictish incursions, and from beholding piratical squadrons of Saxons coming to her coasts with the veering winds."

"                  A critical remark. Not to insist upon the improbability that the Irish in that state of barbarism in which they were certainly involved to-wards the close of the fourth age, could annually transport armies into Britain, we may safely affirm, that the Tethys of Claudian was rather agitated into a foam by Saxon than by Hibernian oars. The Saxons, in the days of Honorius, were"
"in some measure a maritime people; Tethys signifies the ocean: the sea be-tween Germany and England has some right to that title, but the channel be-tween Ireland and Caledonia was never dignified with so high a name. This cri-ticism is sufficient to destroy the whole force of the argument drawn from Clau-dian. It appears not from history that the Scots ever infested the Roman divi-sion of Britain by sea: Constantine ap-pointed an officer called Comes littoris Sax-onici, to take the charge of part of the coast of the province, which was most exposed to the piratical depredations of the Saxons; but of a Comes littoris Scottici Hibernici we have never heard."

"                  Conclusive arguments. If the province of Valentia comprehend the country between the walls, why did not the Hibernian Scots land every other season in Galloway? How came not the Irish rovers to attempt a descent in either of the divisions of Wales or in Cumber-land? Was not the coast of Lancashire almost as near to the Isle of Man, which, according to Orosius, was possessed by Scottish tribes, as any part of the conti-nent of Caledonia was to Ireland? Why, in the name of wonder, was a bulwark of turf or stone a better security against the Irish Scots than against the Saxons of Friezeland or Holland, as both were transmarine nations with respect to the"

"               "
"                  The feudal establish-ments intro-duce histori-cal inquiry. The North, which, upon the decline of the Romans, had filled the provinces of the western empire with its colonies, sent abroad fresh armies of adventurers in the eighth and ninth ages. These, set-tling in some of the regions of the South, gave a new turn to the genius of the Eu-ropean nations. The feudal establish-ments, introduced, or at least, revived and confirmed by them, gave stability to government, and were highly favourable to a spirit of national dignity and inde-pendence. Lands and honours becoming hereditary, gave birth to a pride of family among the great barons; and they en-deavoured to add lustre to the distinctions which they had acquired by tracing their ancestors through the same path of emi-nence to a remote antiquity. From in-dividuals this genealogical enthusiasm spread to whole communities. Men pos-sessed of the little literature of the times, and a talent for fable, either through ig-norance or vanity, indulged the romantic passions of an ignorant race of men, by deducing the origin of their respective na-tions from very distant aeras. The anti-quities of every country in Europe furnish-ed"
"Province? Why did the Irish, with a peculiar absurdity, land always on the wrong side of the Roman walls, which they must have scaled or destroyed before they could penetrate into the province? It is impossible to believe that all their ex-peditions could have been so ill-concerted; and this consideration alone is sufficient to demonstrate that the Scots, whom the Roman writers so often mention, were inhabitants of Caledonia. Walls were constructed and legions employed to fend the province from their incursions, but fleets were never fitted out to intercept or destroy them at sea."

Should the name of Hibernia arise from the position of Ireland with respect to Iberia, Mauri-tania, and a part of Gaul ought to have obtained the same appellation, from a similar situation with regard to Spain. Ireland itself, from a parity of reason, ought to have a name resembling that of Britain, which lies so near it, rather than from Iberia, divided from it by an immense ocean.

But no argument can arise in favour of their su-perior antiquity from that priority. A colony of the ancient Grecians possessed themselves of a district of the lesser Asia, which afterwards obtained the name of Ionia. That colony, and their ancestors in Greece for a series of ages, were called Ionians, but their territories in Europe never possessed the appellation of Ionia; and, from that circumstance, will any man conclude, that the Ionians of Ephe-sus and Miletus were more ancient than those of Attica?"

"fairly deny the consequences ge-nerally drawn from the vague expression of Gildas. Propertius in one of his ele-gies gives the epithet of Hiberni to the Getes of Thrace. Gildas was remarkably fond of expressing himself in the language of poetry. His diction from so puerile an affectation partakes more of the turgid declamation of tragedy, than of the pre-cision and simplicity of a grave historian. Had he, by way of sarcasm on the severity of the climate of Caledonia, bestowed the epithet of Hiberni on its inhabitants, he should not have written improperly, un-poetically, or unlike his own manner."

The British and Irish Scots spoke the same language, wore the same kind of dress, and were distinguished by every characteristical mark necessary to make a foreigner believe that both nations were originally the same people. Whether the Scots of Hibernia, or those of Albania, were the most ancient, every one was at freedom to resolve in his own way. Had Gildas positively decided in favour of the former, his authority can go no further than his confessed knowledge in antiqui-ties. But it appears from other circum-stances, that the British writer was a very bad antiquary. The Scots, accord to him, infested for the first time, the Roman province, when Maximus with-drew the legions from Britain. There is"
"not perhaps any piece of ancient history better ascertained, than that a tribe of the Caledonians, under the name of Scots, made incursions into the province near seventy years before the rebellion of Maximus. The account which Gildas gives of the Roman walls betrays his ig-norance in the tradition, as well as histo-ry, of his own country; and therefore it is difficult to say why the testimony of such a writer, had it even been less equi-vocal, should be thought decisive concern the antiquities of a people to whose tradition and history he must, in the na-ture of things, have been an absolute stranger."

The Picts, in an after age, seized upon North Britain; for to the name of Cale-donia the Anglo-Saxon was an absolute stranger. After the Britons and Picts had possessed the Island for some ages, Britain, in its northern division, received a third nation from Ireland under the conduct of Reuda. Whether the Irish Scots ob-tained settlements of the Picts by force or favour was a point which Bede could not determine. He was however inform that they were called Dalreudini, from their illustrious leader Reuda, and from the Galic word deal, which, according to the venerable writer, signified a por or division of a country"

"                  His mis-takes Where we have an opportunity to ex-amine Bede account by the criterion of collateral history, we find that he has committed a very essential mistake. The southern Britons were so far from deriv their blood from the inhabitants of Armorica, that, on the contrary, the Armoricans had transmigrated from Bri-tain not many ages before Bede own time. If Bede therefore was in an error with respect to the origin of a people, whose history, on account of their con-nection with the Romans, was known, it is much more probable that he knew no-thing certain concerning the antiquities of a nation, who had not among them the means of preserving, with any certainty, the memory of events."

"from them in an age of ignorance, cre-dulity, and barbarism. Bede, on the other hand, entertained a friendly partiali-ty for the Scots of Ireland.

"                  He received his accounts of the Scots from Ire-land. The sudden transition which Bede makes from the tale of Reuda to a pane-gyric on Ireland, furnishes a strong pre-sumption that he derived his information from that quarter.

"                     Usser, Brit, Eccles, Antiq.  320."
"                  . Dalriada, says the ingenious prelate, rives its name from Cairbre-Riada, the son of Conaire, who held the scepter of Ireland in the third century. But we may venture to affirm that Usher, in this supposition, was very much misled. Rute or Reaidh in the old Scotch language signifies a ram. From the first of these synonimous words, the territory in the county of Antrim, from which it is pre-tended, that the British Scots originally transmigrated, received the appellation of the Route, and from the second is to be deduced the name of Dalriada, literally the valley of the Ram."

"                  . From the syllabication of the two local names in the patent, we may conclude that the etymon we have given of Dalriada is per-fectly just. Rachrin, which may, with great propriety, be reckoned an appen-dage to the ROUTE, signifies the ram promontory, in the Irish tongue; and Dalriada itself being expressly called the land of Rams, in the Irish patent mention by the primate himself, is a circum-stance that is decisive in our favour."
"               "
"                  confuted. Dalreath or Dalreadh, which was af-terwards latinized into Dalriada, could not possibly, according to the genius of the Irish language, be derived from Cairbre-Riada, were it even certain that such a monarch ever existed. Riada signifies a long-hand, an appellation joined to the name of Cairbre, on account of the singu-lar length of his hands. The Route, therefore, in propriety of language, ought to have been called Dal-Cairbre, if it must at any rate receive its name from that pretended monarch."

The Saxons of England, it is well known, had their Norfolk and Suf-folk, and the appellation of Southerons and Norlands are not hitherto totally ex-tinguished among the Scots: The ancient Picts, in like manner, were divided into two great tribes, the Vecturiones and Deucaledones, the inhabitants of the northern and southern divisions, according to the testimony of Marcellinus"

If the Picts spoke the Gaëlic or Caledonian language, they must certainly have called the territories of the Scots, Iar, Eire, Erin, or Ard-IarIAR signifies the West; Eir is a corruption of Iar; Erin is the same with the western country, and Ard-Iar is the Galic name for the western quarter., words, all of them, expressive of the situation of the country of the Scottish tribes, in opposition to the Pictish division of Caledonia; if they spoke the ancient British, they would have distinguished the country of the Scots by the name Yverdhon, or, as it is pronounced, Yberon or Yveron. These names being communicated to the Ro-mans by the Britons, or by Pictish pri-soners, it was natural for them to latinize them into Ierna, Jouverna, or Hibernia. In common conversation, the western Highlands are called by those who speak the Galic language IAR, or the West; and when the Hebrides are comprehended in that division of Scotland, the Galic appellation of Iar-in has been always given to the whole. The district of Atregathel, or rather Iar-ghaël, so often mentioned in the annals of Ireland and Scotland, as the first possessions of the Hibernian colonies in Britain, carries in its name a demonstration of this position,"

The river Erin or Ern rises from that lake, and gives its name to a very consi-derable division of the county of Perth. In this district there are to be seen several Roman camps to this day. The Romans could not be strangers to the name of a country where their armies remained long enough to leave such lasting memorials of themselves behind. Juvenal, from the soldiers of Agricola, might have heard of the district of Erin, which he softened into Juverna; and the troops of Theodo-sius might have carried the same intelli-gence to Claudian."

That part of their history, like the ex-ploded Milesian tale, must rest entirely on the credit of their own domestic annals; but that no degree of faith ought to be given to those annals beyond the intro-duction of letters, is a point which we have already very amply discussed. The authority of history having failed, it is natural to suppose that the adversaries of our system will have recourse to objections arising from reason. To do all the justice in our power to the old and popular error concerning the origin of the Scots, we shall examine with attention those objec-tions, before we shall conclude for ever the controversy by arguments, which, though obvious, are new and decisive."

"                  On the rise and progress Could ancient tradition, the belief of ages, the positive assertions of English antiquaries and Irish annalists, and the universal acquiescence of the historians of the British Scots be sufficient to establish the credit of the Hibernian descent of that nation, it must be confessed that it were idle to hope to reconcile the public"
"judgment to a new system so diametrically opposite to the old. But we have seen that tradition could not have extended to that period in which the transmigration of the Scots is placed, and therefore the belief of ages, which was founded upon that pretended tradition, was no more than a popular error. This error ren-dered venerable by its antiquity, misled, to say no worse, the writers of the annals of Ireland, and deceived the historians of North Britain. The antiquaries of Eng-land, it must be confessed, could not be influenced by the prejudices which led astray the writers of both the Scottish nations; but the former were under no temptation to contradict or expose a tra-dition which was not disagreeable to them-selves, though from a very different cause than that which rendered it so highly favoured in Scotland and Ireland."

"                  of the Hi-berno-Scot-tish fictions. It may not be improper, in this place, to inquire into the rise and progress of those traditionary fictions which have so much obscured the antiquities of the Scots of both the Isles. When the first dawn of learning rose among those barbarous tribes who had subverted the empire of the Romans, some scholars more profound than the rest, traced the antiquity of their respective nations to illustrious names recorded in ancient history. The Ro-mans, Greeks, Spaniards, and other na-tions"
"who figured in old times were placed at the head of the pedigree of bar-barians, who, but just emerging from illiterate obscurity, had lost all memory of their own origin. The impostures of the half-learned writers of the middle ages were received with avidity and great cre-dulity by the English, French, Spaniards, Germans, Danes, and Swedes: a part of an infatuation so universal must have ex-tended itself to the Scots of Ireland."
"               "
"                  Cause of the obscurity which in-volves the ancient Irish. The letters which St. Patrick intro-duced into that Island in the fifth age, were not employed in recording historical transactions for some centuries posterior to that period. The enthusiasm of the times turned all the little literature of the religious of Ireland to holier purposes than to register temporal events; which, from the secluded situation of that coun-try, must have been very unimportant. Miracles, visions, and those sacred persons who distinguished themselves in the work of conversion, employed the whole atten of the monks, at a time that the royal line of Heremon sat in the midst of obscurity and anarchy on the Irish throne. The antiquities of the nation being thus left in the hands of illiterate bards and senachies, assumed so monstrous a form, that the polishing they have received from succeeding writers has scarcely hitherto rendered them fit for the public eye."
"               "
"                  "
"                  Aera of the Spanish fic  The fable of the Hibernian extraction of the British Scots seems to have been fabricated in Ireland long before the bards thought of bringing a colony from Spain into that country. Bede, in the seventh age, had received intelligence of the first of those stories from the Irish senachies, but his placing it in a period beyond the reach of tradition has thrown absolute discredit upon the whole. In the period between Bede and Nennius, who, for the first time, mentioned the Cantabric descent of the Scots of Ireland, some learned bard or monk discovered that Spain was called Iberia, and, upon the similarity between that name and Hibernia, built the whole fabric of the Milesian tale. To obviate all scepticism concerning a story which wore the face of improba-bility, it became necessary for succeeding writers to give assurances to the world, that letters and polite arts were cultivated in Ireland no less than seventeen hundred years before its conversion to the christian faith by St. Patrick."
"               "
"                  Cause of the darkness which co-vers the Bri-tish Scots. When monkish learning flourished in Ireland, the Scots of Britain, by an un-interrupted series of hostilities with the Britons, Picts, and Saxons, were diverted from cultivating letters, which alone could enable them to look back into their anti-quities, or to transmit any memory of their actions to posterity. Their exploits"
"in the field died away for want of the means of perpetuating them in the closet. The monks of Ireland, as it was manifest to the whole world that both the Scottish nations were originally the same people, made an easy acquisition of an illiterate, though brave people, and obtruded upon the world that system of the origin of the Caledonian Scots, which has been, for many ages, almost universally received."

"               "
"                  Objections answered. The Irish, it may be objected, were too obscure and inconsiderable a people in Europe to tempt the Scots to deduce their origin from them, if the story had not actually any foundation in fact; especially as their neighbours and enemies to the South traced themselves to an illustrious ancestry of Romans and Trojans. The Scots of Albany entertained a very diffe-rent idea of the Irish nation. Hibernian missionaries had converted the greatest part of the Scots from the errors of the Pagan"
"'superstition; Columba was the great apostle of the Picts, and became after-wards the tutelar saint of the united Ca-ledonian kingdoms. Legions of monks and saints swarmed from Ireland into North Britain in those days of conversion and religious peregrination. It was na-tural for an illiterate people, like the Bri-tish Scots, to believe that a nation who produced these holy and very extraordi-nary men was one of the most illustrious in the world. Whether the zealous missionaries, among other pious frauds, endeavoured to inculcate on their converts a belief of the stupendous antiquity of the Irish nation, and the Hibernian ex-traction of the Scots, to promote the good cause of Christianity, by procuring to themselves a favourable reception in Albany, is very difficult to determine. That those apostles served in the double capacity of bards and teachers of the faith is apparent from the appellation of CHLERI"

"                  The Hiber-nian tales inculcated by Irish missionaries and bards. But be that as it will, it is certain that swarms of Irish bards accompanied into Caledonia those Hibernian missionaries"
"who first converted the majority of the Picts and Scots to Christianity. It was convenient for the divine, that the bard should propagate a belief of the con-nexion between the Scots of both the Isles; and the authority of the former could establish any doctrine in the minds of an ignorant, credulous, and superstitious people. The senachies were impudent, the bards formidable, and both were elo-quent. If any scepticism remained a-gainst their well-told tales, the missionaries destroyed it altogether by the weight of their sanctified character. This system, once established, was propagated, and became the traditional belief of after ages. The little progress that learning made in Scotland when its first histories were writ-ten, could not enable the zealous abettors of its antiquities to overturn that system of the origin of the nation, which had been so long obtruded upon the world; and the Scottish writers who, in a much later period, distinguished themselves in critical inquiries into the history of their ancestors, were at more pains to adorn the fictions of their predecessors, than to expose their absurdities."

"that century, say they, argues strongly that they must have been a new people in Britain. That this is an unjust conclu-sion will appear from collateral examples. Tacitus has not mentioned any national names in North Britain but those of Caledonii and Horestii; yet it is certain that the Vecturiones and Deucaledones of Marcellinus, the Maeatae of Dion Cassius, the Gadeni, Cantae, and Epidii of Pto-lemy, possessed that country. Ptolemy, it must be confessed, knew nothing of the inhabitants of the northern Britain, under the name of Scots; he was equally a stranger to the Picts, Maeatae, and Atta-cotti. But, if he has neglected to men the Scots of Britain, he has been equally unjust to those of Ireland; a circumstance very strange, if that country was, as Bede says, overstocked with tribes of that name before Caledonia received any colony from abroad."
"               "
"                  by collateral examples. Tacitus in his description of Germany has omitted the Saxons. Ptolemy, soon after that celebrated historian, found that warlike nation on the confines of the Chersonesus Cimbrica. Germany is for the first time mentioned by Julius Caesar; and are we to suppose, from that circum-stance, that the inhabitants of that ex-tensive division of Europe came, in the days of the illustrious writer, like a cloud of locusts from an unknown country?"
"The Franks and Allemans were not heard of before the third century; yet those nations, in whom the Catti, Chauci, Cherusci, Agravarii, the Teutones, and the Cimbri, in a confined sense, were lost, were never once thought to have been a new people, who had enslaved, destroyed, or expelled, the old inhabitants of those territories which they possessed in Germany. These collateral examples form a complete answer to the objection against our system, which arises from the silence of the Romans concerning the Picts and Scots till the beginning of the fourth age."

"                  Proofs of the Caledonian extraction of the Scots. To dwell no longer on negative ar-guments against the Hibernian system, we shall proceed to positive proofs of the Caledonian extraction of the British Scots. The very ingenious author of some disser-tations lately published, has discussed this subject with so much ability and exact-ness, that little is left to be done but to collect into one point of view the most striking of his arguments. To these ar-guments we shall annex some observations, to quash for ever a system which had been so long imposed for truth upon the world."
"               "
"                  "
"                  First proof. Alba or Albin, it has been already ob-served, was the first name given to this island, by the Gaël, who transmigrated from Belgium into the more elevated country of Britain. Hence proceeded the Albion of the Greeks, and the Albium of the Roman language. The inhabitants of mountainous countries, who, from their situation, have very little intercourse with other nations, and who were never subject to a foreign yoke, are remarkably tenacious of the local names, and their aboriginal customs, manners, and language. We accordingly find, that the ancient Scots, in all the ages to which our information extends, agreed in calling Scotland Alba or Albania. The High-landers and the inhabitants of the He-brides have, to this day, no other name but Alba for Scotland, and they invaria-bly call themselves Albanich, or genuine Britons. The uninterrupted use of this national appellation, from the earliest ac-count we have of their history, furnishes a moral demonstration that they are the true descendants of the first inhabitants of Britain. Had they been of Irish extrac  they and their ancestors would have undoubtedly assumed a name more suitable to their origin."
"               "
"                  Second proof. The Belgic nations, who transmigrated into South Britain before the descent of Julius Caesar, retained the name of those"
"communities on the continent from which they respectively derived their blood"
"                     Caesar,  "
"                  . The auxiliaries of Vortigern preserved long their original name of Saxons, and the Scots who speak the Galic language have no other name for England or its inhabitants than Sasson and Sassonich. But if the ancient Scots have preserved among them the true name of the English, for so many ages after it has been disused by that nation itself, it is much more likely that they must have retained their own in-digenous name."
"               "
"                  Third proof. Had the Scots been originally Irish, Erinich and not Albanich would have been their proper name. So far were they from adopting the name of their neigh-bours of Hibernia, that it is well known that both the old Irish and the inhabitants of the north of Scotland promiscuously call themselves Gaël, or the posterity of the Gauls, who first transmigrated into Britain from the continent. The Welsh, in ancient times, distinguished the Scots of both the British Isles by the appellation of Gaidhel, which, as the DH are inva-riably quiescent in Celtic words, is much the same with Gaël, in the pronuncia  Should then the Scots be of Irish extract, it must naturally follow that the"
"Picts sprung from the same source, a doc-trine no less absurd than it is new."
"               "
"                  Fourth proof. From the name of the district of Iar-ghael, which, it has been always said, was the first territory possessed by the Hiberno-Scottish colony, there arises a very decisive argument in favour of our system. Iar-ghaël is not the name of the country, but of those who inhabited it from the earliest times. It signifies the Western-Gael in opposition to the Eastern-Gael, or the Picts, who possessed the shore of the German ocean. But what is con-clusive against the Irish system is, that Caeldoch, or the country of the Gaël, which the Romans softened into Caledo-nia, is the only name by which the Highlanders distinguished that division of Scotland which they themselves possess."

"                  the immedi-ate ances-tors of the Scots. Why the Irish obtained, in the days of Orosius, the name of Scots, when their transmigration from Caledonia was so re-mote, requires to be explained. The name of Scotti was communicated to the Romans by the Picts and Britons. The Britons and Romans discovering a perfect resemblance in the manners, customs, dress, arms, and language of the Iar-ghaël, or western Caledonians, and the Irish, agreed to call both nations by one common name. The Irish being no strangers to the military reputation that their friends of Caledonia had acquired against the Romans and their provincials, either adopted their name, or acquiesced afterwards in an appellation which some writers had imposed upon them. The illiterate, and consequently the bulk of the Irish nation, were never reconciled to this innovation. They preserved the Ca-ledonian designation of Gaël, or the name of Erinich, which they had assumed after their transmigration into Ireland, and the adventitious names of Scotti and Scottia fell at last into total desuetude,."

"In the course of the preceding discussi-on, the Author of the Introduction has laid no stress upon the testimony of the Poems of Ossian. Having rejected the Hibernian bards, there might be an ap-pearance of partiality in drawing autho-rities from the ancient poet of Caledonia. In the present state of the argument, there is no need of his assistance. The fabric we have raised demands no collate-ral prop; it even can bestow the aid it does not require. The perfect agreement between Ossian and the genealogical sys-tem we have established, has placed his aera beyond the commencement of the po-pular opinion of the Hibernian descent of the Scots; which was old enough to be placed in a period of remote antiquity by Bede, who flourished in the beginning of the seventh age."

"                  Modern historians blamed. To an investigation of their origin, it may be proper to add a brief inquiry into the Religion of the Ancient British Na-tions. This subject has not suffered less from the negligence, than the former did from the vanity and prejudice of histo-rians. Some complain that the ancients have not thrown any considerable light upon the northern nations; others affirm that the opinions and actions of Barba-rians are unworthy of any memory.

"               "
"                  Author double source of in-formation Though few of the Romans, like the first Caesar, carried a talent for writing into the field, the inquiries of their his-torians extended to the characteristical manners of the nations whom that illus-trious people subdued. We find, ac-cordingly, that there are facts preserved sufficient to prove that the best qualities of the modern Europeans are but the vir-tues of their ancestors separated from fero-city and barbarism. Nor is it from the ancients only we are to derive our infor-mation. The opinions of our forefathers ought to be traced among those of their posterity, whom their situation excluded from any considerable commerce with strangers; such, till of late years, were the inhabitants of a part of Wales, and"

The character of a people must be gathered from an in-quiry into those prejudices and principles of the human mind which are the motives of their actions. To take a cursory re-view of the religious opinions of our re-mote ancestors, is the most direct path to a knowledge of those manners, which so remarkably distinguished them from the polished nations of antiquity. An ample field for disquisition presents itself; but it is more the purpose of the Author to give a clear and concise idea of the sub-ject, than to deviate into dissertations, which, without being satisfactory, might assume an appearance of ingenuity and learning."

The Pelasgi of Peloponnesus and the Islands of the Archipelago were the first of the European Nomades who quit-ted the ambulatory life of their ancestors, and applied themselves to the arts of civil life.

When they became first known to the writers of Greece and Rome, they were formed into communi-ties, subject to some kind of government, and they had an order of men established among them who were not only the su-perintendants, but perhaps the inventors of their religious ceremonies and opinions. It is, however, probable that, like other savage nationsSome tribes of American Indians have an imper-fect idea of God. The Choctaws, in particular, ac-knowledge that there is a NAHULLA CHITO, or Great Spirit, but as he never met either them or their fathers in the woods, to assist them in the chace, or taught them those arts which he communicated to the Europeans, they pay him no divine honours., they had some imperfect notion of a Supreme Being, before the Druids formed that philosophical system of religion which had such a wonderful effect on their national character and manners."

"an emphasis, HES, which means HE, or the Being; and TARANIS is the epithet of THUNDERER, given by all nations to the Supreme DivinityIt has been the opinion of some learned men that TEUTATES is a composition of DI or DEU, God, and TAD or TAT, father. But we may oppose to this etymon, that TAT for father is only used in a familiar sense by very young children, when they address them-selves to a parent; for, according to the genius of the Galic language, it can never be used by grown persons. It is not therefore in any degree probable that a title, in itself a diminutive, was applied to that Great Spirit who pervaded the vast body of the universe. Were a stranger to hear some very good Christians in the moun-tains of Scotland addressing, at this day, their prayers to the Supreme Being, he might suppose that the wor-ship of TEUTATES, TARANIS, and HESUS were not yet abolished in that country.

The heavenly bodies, on account of their splendor, magnitude, and motion; the elements of fire, air and"

The heavenly bodies, and what philosophers call the elements, were proper emblems of a Divinity, whose chief properties were immensity, activity, and force. It is likely, therefore, that the veneration which the Celtae shewed, upon every occasion, for the Sun, Moon, Stars, Fire, great collections of water, and for Forests and Mountains, proceed originally from an opinion that these great objects were the best symbols of the Supreme Being"

"that which the Celtae professed. God was not only the sole agent of the opera-tions of nature, but even the principal part of which nature itself consisted; not so much the giver and preserver of life, as he was that life itself which animated every living thing. From this philoso-phical system opinions arose among the bulk of the Celtae, which almost deviat into polytheism. As it was the busi-ness of God to do every thing, so they thought that the chief wisdom of man should consist in penetrating into his signs, and in endeavouring to avert such of his decisions as might be detrimental to themselves. They, for this purpose, not only addressed their prayers and sacri-fices to the Divinity through those sym-bols we have already mentioned, but also used divinations to discover his intentions, and practised charms to turn the natural course of events."

But that divine ho-nours were paid to those beings who re-sided in different natural objects was cer-tainly the mistake of the writers of Greece and Rome. To prove this seeming para-dox we need only have recourse to the true Celtic names of those heavenly bodies which are universally said to have been objects of the worship to the old northern nations."

"                      There was some years since a stone dug out of the ruins of the Roman preten-ture, between the Scottish firths, inscribed to Apollo Grannius. It was an established maxim of policy a-mong the Romans, rather to adopt the Gods of the nations whom they had subdued, than to propagate their own religion among the conquered. Grynaeus and Grannius are evidently derived from the Celtic GRIAN; which is composed of CRI, trembling; and TEIN, fire. In the oblique cases TEIN makes THEIN, which is pronounced EIN, or AN; the consonants which be-gin the nominative of Celtic words being invariably quuescent in the genitive; so that CRI-EIN, or CRI-AN, literally signifies the trembling fire, in allusion to the sun appearance to the eye. Ossian countenances this etymon of CRIAN in his address to that luminary. 'Stu CRI aig dorsa airdiar. When thou TREMBLEST at the gates of the west.. The"

These appellations carry in their meaning a demonstration that the heavenly bodies were not worshipped by our ancestors. GELLACH is litterally a pale or wan complexion by an emphasis; and RINNAC, a point of light; titles utterly inconsistent with the supposed divinity of the objects which bore them."

"                  The hea-venly bodies animated by inferior in-telligences. It is certain that the Celtic nations thought that the heavenly bodies were the residences of intelligences subordinate to God. These spirits were distinguished by the name of AISEAISE, generally used in the Galic language with the article  or  prefixed to it, signifies a ghost or spirit. AISE is perhaps the original of the Asae of the northern nations. Duodecim sunt Asae divinis afficiendi honoribus . . . . . . Odinus supremus et antiquissimus Asarum. Edda Island. ALMEGTE-AAS, in the language of Scandinavia, signifies Almighty God. It is remarkable that the Highlanders, when they speak con-temptuously of the person and parts of any man, call him An AISE, or the ghost; which is an argument that their ancestors did not worship the AISE, or the spirits which resided in the elements., a word expressive of their feebleness and imbecillity in comparison of  the Supreme Divinity. But we have reason to believe, from the following circumstance, that GRIAN-AIS, or the Spirit of the Sun, was an-ciently peculiarly honoured in Caledonia. In the confines between Badenoch and Strathspey, two districts of the county of Inverness, there is a very extensive heath which goes by the name of SLIA GRIAN-AIS, or the Plain of the Spirit of the Sun. The river Spey, which is there deep and rapid, borders this heath on the South; and a chain of craggy mountains, in the form of a half moon, interspersed with precipices and a few naked trees, confines it on the North.

"evident remains of the superstitions of the Druidical system of religion. It was a custom, till of late years, among the in-habitants of whole districts in the North of Scotland, to extinguish all their fires on the evening of the last day of April. Early on the first day of May some select persons met in a private place, and, by turning with great rapidity an augre in a dry piece of wood, extracted what they called the forced or elementary fireTEIN-EGIN, or the forced fire. The practice of extracting the TEIN-EGIN is not yet altogether discon-tinued among the ignorant vulgar.. Some active young men, one from each hamlet in the district, attended at a distance, and, as soon as the forced fire was kindled, carried part of it with great expedition and joy to their respective villages. The people immediately assembled upon some rock or eminencee, lighted the BEL-TEIN, and spent the day in mirth and festivity."

It is in vain to inquire why those ignorant persons, who are addicted to this superstition, throw into the BEL-TEIN a portion of those things upon which they regale themselves on the first of May. Neither is there any reason assigned by"
"them for decking branches of mountain-ashClou-äan BEL-TEIN, i.  the split branch of the fire on the rock. Those who have ingrasted Christiani-ty on many of the superstitions of their remotest ances-tors have now converted the Clou-än BEL-TEIN into a cross. with wreaths of flowers and heath, which they carry, with shouts and ges-tures of joy, in procession three times round the fire. These branches they afterwards deposite above the doors of their respective dwellings, where they remain till they give place to others in the succeed year."
"               These and many other extraordinary and superstitious ceremonies, used upon this occasion, have, it is certain, much of the appearance of religious worship paid by the ancient Caledonians to the Sun. The rude monuments which, as we have already observed, bear still the name of GRIAN-AIS, seem, at first sight, to put the certainty of the existence of polytheism among the Celtae beyond any dispute; but we may venture to affirm, that neither of those circumstances furnishes a conclusive argument upon that head."

Though it was a fundamental maxim in the opinions of the Celtae concerning God, that he was the sole agent in all operations of nature, they were far from supposing that his decrees were predeter-mined and unalterable. The first busi-ness, therefore, as has been already ob-served, was to penetrate into his designs by means of divination, and afterwards to endeavour to avert from themselves such of those designs as might be detrimental, by the assistance of sacrifice, prayers, and inchantment. The element of fire, and above all, the Sun, which is the source of it, were objects in which the soul of the world seemed most manifestly to ex-ert itself; and consequently they, more than any other part of nature, employed the attention of a superstitious people: and this attention soon degenerated into those ridiculous ceremonies which we have just described. As such circular piles of stones as we have already men-tioned are only to be met with on plains, we may conclude that they were only arti-ficial eminences raised for the BEL-TEIN, in places where rocks, from which it ori-ginally derived its name, could not be found."

"                  The Sun not wor-shipped by our ances-tors; We have in our hands a positive proof that the Sun was not an object of worship among the ancient Caledonians. A poem, the composition of which is placed beyond the introduction of Christianity into the north Britain, has preserved the real opi-nion of our ancestors concerning the Spi-rit of the Sun. The subject of the piece is a war between two Scandinavian chiefs, in which one of them, having the misfor-tune to fall into the hands of his enemy, gives occasion to the following simile:"
"               "
"                  Seized amidst the shock of armies—Clugar struggled in all his thongs, and rolled in wrath his red eyes.—Thus ho-vering over the bleak waves of the North,—when GRIAN-AIS sleeps, wrapt in his cloud, a sudden frost comes on all his wings.—He struggles, he loudly roars.—Wide over the broad regions of snow is heard a voice!—His large red eyes flame through the dusky evening: The Cruglians shrink to their caves

The terrors which the poet has placed around him, serve only to highten the ridicule of his distress. The whole, in short, is absolutely in-consistent with that prescience and power, which are attributes necessary to constitute a Divinity. But if the intelligence who resided in the Sun, and who was pecu-liarly honoured by an unmixed branch of the Celtae, could not, in their opinion, extricate his wings from the effects of a frosty evening, we may justly conclude, that the spirits placed in less dignified objects of nature, were actually what they were called, AISE, or feeble sha-dows"

"                  General re-flections. To collect into one point of view the opinion of the Celtic nations upon the subject of religion, they originally believ that the Supreme Divinity  as the soul of the world, pervaded the whole body of nature. This philosophical idea degenerated, among the bulk of the peo-ple, into a supposition that some objects of nature, instead of being animated by God himself, became the residences of spirits, who, in subordination to him, di-rected the operations of their respective portions of matter. To these intelligen-ces they gave the name of AISE, or sha-dowy ghosts, expressive of the vast dispro-portion between them and that Being who was the source from which these spi-rits themselves, as well as every thing possessed of life and motion, derived their existence. It is, upon the whole, highly probable, that the rites which some of the ancients took for sacrifices to subordinate Divinities among the Celtae, were no ther than ceremonies used by those Bar-barians for the purpose of their pretended divinations and inchantments."

Whole nations have come down into the region of true history without having pla-ced a tenet so essential to religion in their faith. The infancy of society is not favour-able to speculative inquiry. Mankind, in their rudest state, scarce ever extend their ideas beyond objects of sense. They per-ceive, when death suspends the functions of the body, that the man ceases to act and to feel; and the subsequent dissolution of his whole frame establishes the supposi  that his being is at an end. Nature herself confirms the opinion from every quarter by symptoms of decay. The oak"

It is a matter of great doubt with many, whether the Jews themselves admitted, in an early period, the Immortality of the Soul a-mong the articles of their faith.

The ancients are extremely imperfect in their accounts of the pleasures which the Celtae enjoyed in their future state; neither does the Islandic Edda, now in the hands of the learned, supply that fect. The nations to the North and East of the Baltic were a very different race of men from the more ancient inhabitants of the rest of Europe. It was after the tyranny and civilization of the Romans had broken the spirit, and destroyed the virtues of the Celtae, that the Sarmatic Tartars of the East and North advanced into the South, and established their opinions in the regions which they sub-dued. It is therefore in vain to trace the speculative ideas of the ancient Bri-tons, concerning their NOBLE ISLAND, in the legends of Odin Hall."

"            INquiries into antiquity are so little the taste of the present age, that a writer who employs his time in that way deceives himself if he expects to derive either much reputation or any advantage from his work. Pre-judiced against the subject, we add contempt to its natural steri-lity, and seem to wish for no in-formation from a province which we have been taught to assign to fiction and romance. Under these impressions the Author of the Introduction wrote. With-out any of the ordinary incite-ments to literary labour, he was induced to proceed by the sole motive of private amusement."

The blast of wind waited for his commands at the gate; he rode the tempest, and the troubled wave offered itself as a pillow for his re-pose. His eye followed the sun by day; his thoughts travelled from star to star in the season of night

An unusual terror seized the aged magician: He heard a voice though he saw no human form. Arise, behold the boat of the heroes—arise, and see the green Isle of those who have passed away"

                     He felt a strange force on his limbs: he saw no person; but he moved to the boat. The wind immediately changed. In the bosom of the cloud he sailed away. Seven days gleamed faintly round him; seven nights added their gloom to his darkness. His ears were stunned with shrill voices. The dull murmur of winds"
"passed him on either side. He slept not; but his eyes were not heavy: he ate not, but he was not hungry. On the eighth day the waves swelled into mountains; the boat rocked violently from side to side. The darkness thickened around him, when a thousand voices at once cried aloud, The Isle, the Isle. The billows opened wide before him; the calm land of the departed rushed in light on his eyesThere is a great similarity between this passage and the romantic description given by Procopius of those whose office it was to transport departed souls to the Celtic Paradise.—Narrant indignae, se habere munus, ut in orbem, sua quisque vice, deducunt animas. Hi, primis tenebris dant se somno, rei praesidem expectantes.

                     It was not a light that dazzled, but a pure, distinguishing, and placid light, which called forth every object to view in their most perfect form. The Isle spread large before him like a pleasing dream of the soul; where distance fades not on the sight; where nearness fatigues not the eye. It had its gently-sloping hills of green; nor did they wholly want their clouds: But the clouds were bright and transparent; and each involved in its bosom the source of a stream; a beaute-ous stream, which, wandering down the"
"'steep, was like the faint notes of the half-touched harp to the distant ear. The valleys were open, and free to the ocean; trees loaded with leaves, which scarcely waved to the light breeze, were scattered on the green declivities and rising grounds. The rude winds walked not on the moon-tain; no storm took its course through the sky. All was calm and bright; the pure sun of autumn shone from his blue sky on the fields. He hastened not to the West for repose; nor was he seen to rise from the East. He sits in his mid-day height, and looks obliquely on the Noble Isle.
                     In each valley is its slow-moving stream. The pure waters swell over the banks, yet abstain from the fields. The showers disturb them not; nor are they lessened by the heat of the sun. On the rising hill are the halls of the departed—the high-roofed dwellings of the heroes of old.
                  
               
               
                  General re-marks. Thus far is the Tale worthy of transla  Incoherent fables succeed the scription; and the employments of the Blessed in their Fortunate Island differ, in no respect, from the amusements of the most uncultivated inhabitants of a moun-tainous country. The bodies with which the bard clothes his departed heroes have more grace, and are more active, than

those they left behind them in this world; and he describes with peculiar elegance the beauty of the women. After a very transient vision of the NOBLE ISLE, the magician of Skerr returned home in the same miraculous manner in which he had been carried across the ocean. But though in his own mind he comprehended his absence in sixteen days, he found every thing changed at his return. No trace of his habitation remained; he knew not the face of any man. He was even forced, says the Tale, to make inquiry concern himself; and tradition had scarcely carried down his name to the generation who then possessed the Island of SKERR. Two complete centuries had passed away since his departure; so imperceptible was the flight of time in the felicity of the Celtic Paradise.
               
                  The souls of the departed visited at times this world. The departed, according to the Tale, retained in the midst of their happiness a warm affection for their country and friends. They sometimes visited the first; and by the latter, as the bard ex-presses it, they were transiently seen in the hour of peril, and especially on the near approach of death. It was then that at midnight the death-devoted, to use the words of the Tale, were sud-denly awakened by a strange knocking at their gates; it was then that they heard

the undistinct voice of their departed friends calling them away to the Noble Isle

                  .—A sudden joy, continues the Author of the Tale, rushed in upon their minds: and that pleasing melancholy, which looks forward to happiness in a distant land. It is worthy of being re-marked, that though those who died a natural death were not excluded from the Celtic Paradise, the more pleasant divi-sions of the FLATH-INNIS, or NOBLE ISLE, were assigned to men who fell in war.
               
                  Cause of the con-tempt of death a-mong our ancestors. The animated descriptions which the Druids and Bards gave of FLATH-INNIS, or the NOBLE ISLE, rendered the Celtic nations careless about a transitory life which must terminate in happiness

To the same cause, and not to a want of docility of dispo-sition and temper, we ought to ascribe their small progress in the arts of civil life before the Phoenicians and Greeks, with their commerce, and the Romans, with their arms, introduced a taste for luxury into the regions of the West and North.
            
         
         
            

            CHARACTER, MANNERS, AND CUSTOMS OF THE ANCIENT BRITISH NATIONS.
            
               Their Character.
               
                  Cause of variety in the charac-ters of na-tions. THE principles of reason are so unchangeable in themselves, that were men to form their actions upon them there would be little diversity in the cha-racter of nations. The speculative opi-nions of the Brahmin on the banks of the Ganges differed not materially from those of the Druid on the Rhine; but there was no similarity between the igno-rant Indian and the illiterate German. The bulk of mankind deliver themselves over to the direction of their passions; climate, constitution of body, mode of education, manner of life, and a thou-sand circumstances of less importance than these, give rise to those peculiari-ties which distinguish individuals from one another, and diversify the characters of

nations. Without this variety, history would languish in the sameness of events; for the motives which produce human actions furnish more amusement in narra than the actions themselves.
               
                  The An-cient British passionate and impe-tuous, The Ancient British Nations, like their Celtic brethren on the continent, were fierce, passionate, and impetuous; sudden in resolution, sanguine in expectation, impatient under disappointment. This warmth and vehemence of temper pro-ceeded, according to the ancients, from the full habit of their bodies, and the abundance of their blood
                     Septentrionales populi largo sanguine redundantur. Veget. i.

                  ; and these circumstances naturally led to a careless boldness, which threw disgrace on their conduct, when it displayed their courage. warlike, War, which was their chief business, was their great amusement. They were in love

Men of vivacity, and subject to passion, are, for the most part, inconstant, changeable, rash, curi-ous, credulous, and proud. precipitate, All the branches of the Celtic nation determined suddenly upon affairs of the greatest mo-ment, and placed the foundation of reso-lutions of the last importance upon un-certain rumours, and vague reports

                  from the Celtae, or Gaël. The extensive regions between the Rhine and the Baltic were possessed by Galic tribes when Germany became first known to the writers of Rome. An unavoidable mixture with the Sarmatae beyond the Vistula and the Baltic had an effect on the genius of the Celtae of Ger-many; and they departed, in some gree, from the purity of the language and from some of the manners of their ancestors. They however retained so many marks of their Galic origin, that some have thought that the name of Ger-mans proceeded from their similarity in every respect to the inhabitants of Gaul

                  Their mi-grations and conquests. More than three centuries prior to the Christian aera, the German Celtae, under the name of Cimbri, ravaged all the re-gions lying between the Rhine and the Ionian sea

                  . They at the same time ex-tended their conquests to Spain and to

Their violence in rushing into new pro-jects could be only equalled by their want of perseverance in any plan. The tide seldom ran long in one direction; it was always with them a precipitate ebb, or a tempestuous flow.
               
                  curious, The curiosity which so remarkably di-stinguished the ancient Gauls has come down with their posterity to the present times. The Highlanders of North Bri-tain are so fond of news, that even the poorest labourers, upon seeing at a great distance a traveller on the road, often quit their work, run to meet him, and, with great earnestness, intreat him to tell them something concerning the state of public affairs. If he is communicative they ac-company him perhaps for many miles, and they seem to think themselves well recom-pensed for the time they have lost by the intelligence which they have received

                  hospitable, Our ancestors were hospitable beyond example. To receive the stranger with cheerfulness, to lodge him in their best apartments, to treat him with their greatest delicacies, was a law which custom had rendered inviolable and universal
                     Mortalium omnium erga hospites humanissimi. Procop. Aedis.  iii.
                     
                  . It

was not till after he signified his desire of pursuing his journey that they inquired about his country and his name

                  ; and they excused this piece of curiosity in themselves by saying, that they were anxious to know some few particulars concerning a person who had so much honoured their habitation with his pre-sence. When they saw a traveller upon the road they ran to meet him, and, with an earnestness that bordered on compul-sion, invited him to their houses; and there was often a kind of jealousy and contention between the neighbours about the honour of being the first who should entertain the stranger. The decision in these disputes was left to the traveller; and the disappointed person used to say, that God was favourable to him who had the good fortune to be preferred

                  . At night they never shut their gates

"the traveller, say they, should come and be disappointed, when we are asleep, and not ready to invite or receive him"
"                        Hospites violare, fas non putant, qui quaqua causâ eos venerunt, ab injuria prohibent, sanctos-que habent; iis omnium domus patent, victusque com-municatur. Caesar,  "

                  proud, and haughty. The haughtiness, self-conceit, and na-tional pride which the ancients found a-mong the Celtae
                     Celtae magna seipsis sentiunt, Arrian. Exped. Alex.
                     
                  , was not peculiar to that race of men. The vulgar of every country have a high opinion of their own nation. National pride is, at the worst, an useful weakness; for men who think meanly of themselves are seldom capable of great actions.—These are the most striking outlines of the character of the ancient inhabitants of Britain. To any man acquainted with the nature and ge-nius of the unmixed part of the posterity of the Celtae, in the northern division of the Island, the authorities at the bottom of the page are superfluous. He will be convinced of the justness of the descrip  by the observations he himself has made; and he will be, at the same time, surprised to see the accurate exactness, with which the writers of Rome have drawn the portrait of our ancestors.
            
            
               

               Their Amusements and Diversions.
               
                  Amuse-ments of the ancient Britons The British branch of the Celtae, like the great stock from which they sprung, were, almost in every thing, on the ex-treme. They placed their chief happi-ness in the most perfect inactivity, or in the most violent exertions of the body. Wedded to the strange opinion, that all labour, whether of body or mind, was mean and disgraceful, they dedicated the whole time that remained to them from war and the chace, to sleep, and a very few domestic diversions

                  .
               
                  consisted in feasts To feast together, and to regale them-selves, held the first place in their amuse-ments. Every slight occurrence was seized upon with eagerness, as an excuse for conviviality and public entertainment. Without the banquet nothing important was ever done. The feast was, as it were, the seal which gave validity to pub-lic conventions, the sanction which ren-dered inviolable private friendships. The name-day of every person in a family was kept, marriages were celebrated with un-common festivity, and funerals solemnized with lavish hospitality. The love of a

reputation for hospitality was carried so far, that the great men in the community often pitched tents and built huts on the public road, for the pleasure of enter-taining indiscriminately all those who pas-sed that way
                     Athenaeus,  
                  . These entertainments have been known to last a whole year; and the hospitable chief, not content with giving a general invitation to all the members of the state, placed parties of men on the by-roads of the country, to bring passengers, by a kind of compul-sion, to his table.
               
                  and public The dishes at those feasts were not nu-merous, and there was little variety in the cookery. Fish of various kinds, the flesh of tame animals, wild fowl, and ve-nison, were served up, as at present, in the three modes of boiled, broiled, and roasted

                  . They abstained from tame fowl: Geese, ducks, and hens they only reared for pleasure
                     Caesar,  
                  . The utensils used upon these occasions were few in number and simple in their fashion. Spits and large earthen pots were the whole furni-ture

of the kitchen; wooden, and some-times earthen and pewter platters

                  , that of the table. The guests, as to this day in France, brought along with them their own knives and forks, which hung from the girdle in the same sheath
                     
                        
                           
                         
                        Idem apud eun-dem.

                  entertain-ments. The side-tables of the old Britons were not decorated with all the splendour of modern times. On them were only to be seen drinking cups of various sizes, in number equal to those who sat at table. One of the cups was generally of silver, the rest of wood, horn
                     Cornibus barbari septentrionales potant. Plin.  xi.
                      
                     Cornua ab labris argento circumcludunt. Caesar,  
                     
                  , earth, and sometimes of shell. The better sort sat at a table in the center of the great hall. Their dependents, compleatly armed, as if on guard, formed a wider circle, and regaled themselves, at the same time
                     
                        
                           
                         
                        Posid. ubi supra.
                     
                  ,

on long benches very little raised from the ground. They were waited upon at table by girls and boys not arived at the years of puberty
                     
                        
                           
                         
                        Diod. Sic.  
                     
                  . When they had done eating, the most honourable man at the feast called for a cup of ale, the com-mon drink of the Celtae, or of wine, after commerce had introduced it among them. He drank, as we do at present, to the next on his right hand; and the same cup being filled to the brim to each per-son, went round the whole circle. The women were
                     Ductae in eos conventus auxores. Athen.  
                     
                   not only admitted but highly honoured at their entainments; they retired, as with us, before the men proceeded to downright ebriety.
               
                  Of singing, The bards held a conspicuous place at public entertainments; and a great part of the amusement of our ancestors was derived from their songs. They repeat their compositions in every branch of poetry; the heroic, the elegiac, the ludi-crous, the severe. The words were set to music; the bard recited nothing where the voice was not sustained by some in-strument. The harp was appropriated

to the serious; a flute or pipe accompa-nied the comic and lively.
               
                  dancing, That species of dancing which the Greeks distinguished by the name of Pyr-rhic, was an universal amusement a-mong the Celtic nations. A number of young men in complete armour rushed in suddenly before the guests, at a certain pe-riod of the warlike music, danced with great agility, and kept time by striking their swords against their shields
                     Xenophon. Exped. Cyr.  
                  . When the spectators were, for a short time, a-mused with this shew, the music suddenly changed, the armed dancers disappeared with a shout of war, and a band of young women entered, tripping hand in hand to a merry air
                     Mulieres etiam saltant, una alteram manu tenen-tes. Strabo,  iii.
                     
                  . They too, at a certain period of the music, vanished at once; the young men entered again as if engaged in action, and to the sound of the accom-panying instrument exhibited all the in-cidents of a real battle
                     Xenophon. Exped. Cyr.  
                  .
               
                  duelling, Neither were the guests at Celtic en-tertainments gratified with fictitious bat-tles only; the young warriors frequently challenged one another to single combat to shew their bravery. The gladiatorial spectacles at Rome proceeded from this

characteristical custom of the Barbarians of the North of Europe; who, contrary to the opinions of all other nations, plac death itself in the number of their amusements
                     Mortem pro joco habent. Athen.  
                     
                  . This peculiarity they carried to such an extravagant pitch, that a stranger, if renowned for his va-lour, thought himself dishonoured should his host neglect to give him an opportu-nity of breaking a spear with some brave man among his friends.
               
                  games of chance. The eagerness for games of chance, which Tacitus found among the Ger-mans, was not entirely confined to the continent. The ancient Bards have transmitted to us, in their songs, many proofs that dice were not unknown among the Caledonians. The Bards, however, do not inform us that the northern Bri-tons carried their passion for gaming so far as to place their liberty, which was more valuable than life itself in the eyes of the Celtae, upon a single throw of the dye

               Their Morality and Poetry.
               
                  General reflections. Vice is not natural to man; he derives it from those fictitious wants which grow with the progress of society. Before proper-ty becomes the means of procuring sensual pleasure, civil restraints are superfluous, and morality itself an unnecessary study. The contempt which the Celtic nations shewed for death, is a proof that they were not anxious about the possession of the conveniencies of life; and that circum-stance shut up the great channel of cor-ruption which pollutes the human mind in an advanced stage of civility. We may here without impropriety observe, that the vices of Barbarians proceed from prejudice, and their virtues from na-ture.
               
                  Morality taught by the Druids, The Druids, with their speculative opinions on religion, inculcated upon their followers some general maxims of mora-lity. The result of their inquiries in other branches of philosophy, their dis-coveries in the nature and properties of matter, they confined to themselves, to astonish into a veneration for their order a race of men whom they wished to govern through the channel of prejudice and igno-rance.

Great Britain. The Lusitanians, ac-cording to Diodorus Siculus, were the most warlike branch of the Cimbri
                     
                        
                           
                         
                        Diod. Sic.  
                     
                  ; and the Welsh retain, in their name, an undoubted mark of their Cimbric extracti-on. From these revolutions of the Cel-tae on the continent we shall, in a sub-sequent section, deduce the origin of the British nations.
            
            
               The European Sarmatae.
               
                  Irruption of the Europe-an Sarmatae; The successive migrations of the Bar-barians of the North may be compared to the transient storms of a showery day. The Sun scarce returns after one cloud is past, before another begins to gather in the same quarter of heaven. The short space between is filled with that pleasing but melancholy serenity which attends joys whose period is approaching in view.—The first irruption of the nations of the northern Germany happened, as we have already observed, more than three cen-turies before the commencement of our present aera. About two ages after, the Celtae beyond the Rhine threw another fleece of adventurers, under the name of

Darkness was favourable to the continuance of their power; and they encouraged into a settled contempt that dislike to science and the arts of civil life which the northern nations derived from their natural aversion to mental, as well as to bodily labour.
               
                  and Bards, The moral character of our ancestors owed more to the compositions of the Bard
                     Viguere studia laudabilium doctrinarum inchoata per Bardos. Amm. Marcell.  
                     
                   than to the precepts of the Druid. That elevation of soul which the first inspired was more favourable to virtue than the cold dictates of the latter; for the mind which entertains a conscious and dignified pride seldom harbours vice. The influence which the Bards derived from the instruction and amusement with which their poems furnished their countrymen, raised them to equal honours with the Druids themselves. The respect for their order was so great and universal, that armies engaged in action have been known to desist from battle when the Bards threw themselves between the lines
                     
                        
                           
                         
                        Diod. Sic.  
                     
                  . They

were held in as much veneration by the enemies of their nation as by their coun-trymen and friends; for as an ancient Bard expresses himself, the world is the country, and mankind the relations of every genuine Poet.
               
               
                  who were divided into three classes. The compositions of the Bards, ac-cording to the ancients, comprehended the religion, the laws, and history of the Celtic nations. To commit those poems to memory, to repeat them on solemn occasions, was the great amusement and study of their vacant hours. It is highly probable, though the observation is not made by the writers of Greece and Rome, that the order of the Bards were divided into three different classes. The British and Irish Scots had their FER-LAOI, or Hymnists

figure in war

                  . Each of these classes kept its own province entire. They in-terfered not in the least with one another; the FER-LAOI descended not into the re-gion of the SENACHY, nor did the SE-NACHY rise to the sublimity of the FER-DAN, who derived from his poetical ge-nius his only title to the name of Bard. The hymns of the FER-LAOI were lost by the introduction of a new religion; and the works of the SENACHY expired in their natural dulness. A few of the compositions of the FER-DAN have tri-umphed over the ravages of time; and prove that the Bards inculcated the purest morals on their countrymen, and compre-hended in their songs all those virtues which render a man truly great, and servedly renowned.
               
                  Character of the ancient Britons formed on the poems of the Bards. The ancient British nations heard their poems with such rapture and enthusiasm, that they formed their character and man-ners upon the model of the virtues which the Bards recommended in their songs. In an age unacquainted with science men became disinterested, gene-rous,

and noble, as individuals; as a nation they were inconsiderable and ob-scure in the absence of those civil improve-ments which alone can render a commu-nity respectable and great. A publication which the Author of the Introduction has already given to the world establishes the justness of the above observation. It at the same time shews, that the personal virtues of individuals avail little to perpe-tuate the fame of an uncultivated nation; and it also proves, that no dignity of character, no greatness of soul, can res-cue the prince from the oblivion which must involve his unpolished and illiterate people. Fingal passed away unnoticed in Caledonia, at the time that Helioga-balus employed the page of the historian at Rome.
               
                  Subject of their poems. To recommend valour in war by the example of ancient times

                  , to encourage the generous feelings of the mind with penegyric, to animate the living to noble deeds by celebrating the great actions of the dead

                  , were not the only subjects which employed the genius of the Celtic Bards. They travelled to the various

regions of poetry, to the sentimental, the ludicrous, the severe. Of the two latter nothing of any antiquity remains. The ludicrous is local and temporary; and satire ceases to please when the follies it reprehends are lost in length of time. The sentimental is peculiar to no age; it suits the inherent feelings of the human mind; and when clothed with glowing imagery, and expressed in smooth versifi-cation, it pleases the fancy, and adheres to the memory. It is to an union of all these circumstances we owe the preserva of the greatest part of the poems of Ossian, which contribute to finish the picture of our ancestors, of which the outlines have been drawn by the writers of Greece and Rome.
               The poets, in short, were the great, the favourite instructors of the ancient Briton. He attended to the precept of the Druid with awe; he heard the senti-ment of the Bard with rapture. Reserv  severe, and imperious, the first, when he enlightened, endeavoured to enslave the mind; the latter elevated the soul with pleasure, when he improved it with instruction.

                  of an enor-mous size. The ancients, astonished at the enor-mous size of the Celtae, endeavoured to account for that phaenomenon in a physi-cal way. Caesar, in speaking of the Germans, attributes their great stature to the gross food with which they were nourished, and to the continual exercise which was the natural attendant on the two occupations of hunting and depreda-tory war. The illustrious writer ascribes it in part to the uninterrupted freedom of action they enjoyed in their youth; to the want of all application to study; and to the consequent absence of correction when boys
                     Non multum frumento, sed maximam partem lacte atque pecore vivunt, multumque

Caesar,  
                     
                  . To all these causes com-bined the Celtae, according to Caesar, owed that immense height of body which rose so remarkably over the standard of other nations.
               
                  

                  Cause of that phaeno-menon. These circumstances may have contri-buted to the great size of the Celtic na-tions, but they were far from being the only cause. The Tartars, who migrated in the fourth and fifth ages into the pro-vinces of the western empire, differed not materially in their manner of life from the Celtae, yet they fell much short of them in stature. Among mankind, as in other animals, there seem to be a vari-ety of species; some are by nature mere pigmies, others of gigantic proportions. No climate, no change of food can raise the Laplander to the height of the Ger-man: and subject the latter for ages to the intense cold and scarcity of food in the arctic circle, and he will not dwindle into the mean stature of the present inha-bitant of Lapland.
               
                  The British tallest of all the Celtae. Of all the branches of the Celtae, the ancient Britons, the Germans not even excepted, were the greatest in the height of their bodies

They were not then chained to the distaff, or confined to the trivial cares of domestic life. They entered into the active scenes of public affairs, and, with a masculine spirit, shared the dangers and fatigues of the field with their husbands and friends. They unmanned not their countrymen in the hour of peril with vain terrors and complaints; they animated them to action

with exhortation, and confirmed their va-lour with examples of personal courage

                  . A new people accompanied them in this expedition, who, in their designation of TeutoniThe learned have thrown away a great deal of useless erudition upon the etymon of this word. It is a Celtic one signifying northern men: Tua north taoni men, a word of the same import with the Normans of after ages.

                  . The Celto-Germans who remained beyond the Elb on the shores of the ocean, and in the peninsula of Juteland, gave the name of TEUTIONI, or northern men, to

Germans, according to Tacitus, thought that something divine dwelt in female minds: Women were admitted to their public deliberations, and they did not despise their opinions or neglect to follow their advice

                  . To such a pitch had some branches of the Celtae carried their veneration for the fair sex, that, even in their life-time, a kind of divine honours was paid to some distinguished women
                     Vidimus sub Divo Vespasiano Velledam, diu apud plerosque numinis loco habitam. Sed et olim Auri-niam, et complures alias venerati sunt, non adulatione, nec tanquam facerent Deas. Tacit. Germ.  
                     
                  . The ancient Britons were peculiarly fond of the government of wo-men. Succession, where it was establish at all, went in the female as well as in the male line

                  observations on the size of the Celtae. Some late writers have ascribed the enormous size and corpulence of the Bar-barians of ancient Europe to their use of beer, the universal beverage of all the

branches of the Celtic nations. Had the observation been just, the present English should exceed their fathers in stature; but this is so far from being the case, that they fall short of the modern Germans, and are scarce superior, in that respect, to the French, who, from possessing the grape, have for ages discontinued the drinking of beer. To strengthen the argument it may be here observed, that the inhabitants of London, who use beer the most, are of a smaller size than those who live less luxuriously in other parts of the kingdom. To solve the difficulty we must have recourse to a remark already made; that the Sarmatae, who, upon the decline of the Romans, advanced into the regions of the West, were a very different race of men from the Celtae, and that they sent down their low size, with their blood, to the present inhabitants of Eu-rope, who are, in a great measure, their posterityThe general use of spirits, which has much pre-vailed of late in Europe, may have contributed to lessen the size of the present race. Distilled liquors certain-ly check the growth of the human body; neither is wine itself favourable to it. This much is certain, that the inhabitants of the mountains of Scotland have fallen much short of the stature and robust habit of body of their ancestors, within this last century, dur which they have been acquainted with the still. Ale was their common and favourite beverage from all antiquity..
               
                  

                  Effects of climate on the size of men, The great stature of the ancient Bri-tons may, in some degree, be ascribed to the humidity of the climate under which they lived. The same temperature of air which favours the extraordinary growth of vegetables, may contribute to increase the size of the human body, where it is not checked by that mode of life and hard labour which civil improvements have introduced into modern Europe. The inhabitants of cloudy regions and swampy countries, even at this day, ex-ceed in stature those who live under a serene sky and on a dry and light soil. The Germans who possess the fens be-tween the Scheld and the Elbe rise beyond the standard of the inhabitants of the up-per Germany, and the English of the morasses of Lincoln exceed in size the inhabitants of the downs of Hamp-shire.
               
                  and beauty of their wo-men. But whatever effect the humidity of the air had on the stature of the northern Celtae, it certainly contributed to that whiteness of skin by which they were so remarkably distinguished. The beauty of their women

                  , those ruddy and florid complexions which glow in the descripti-ons of the ancients

                  , may, in some mea-sure,

be ascribed to the moist atmosphere which still clothes our fields with a kind of perpetual green. But the superior beauty of the Celtic women, as it was common to all the nations of ancient Europe des-cended from the same stock, must, like the stature of the men, have proceeded from their being a different race from the Sarmatae, who carried their homely looks with their small size into the regions of the West.
               The uncorrupted chastity, the absolute abstinence from early venery, which a virtuous kind of prejudice established into an inviolable law among the Celtic nati-ons, must have conduced to the immense size of their bodies. To have any com-merce with women before the age of twenty was one of the most disgraceful and unpardonable of all crimes

               Their Manner of Life.
               
                  Observa-tions. Our ancestors had the misfortune, if there is any misfortune in the want of importance with posterity, to be seen distinctly by foreigners before either time or accident had polished them out of their natural rudeness and barbarity. Nations who have the advantage of be the recorders of their own actions cover the beginnings of their history with splendid fictions, or place them in the shade to heighten the features of their more authentic same. The light which the Romans threw upon the northern nations, in their uncultivated state, by rescuing their manners from oblivion, has taken away from their renown. Men accustomed to the luxuries of advanced society look with a kind of ontempton the inconveniencies of rude life. This consideration has induced the Author of the introduction to confine, within nar-row bounds, his observations on the man-ners of the ancient British nations; for where the road lies through a barren coun-try the journey ought to be short.
               
                  

                  Agricul-ture, &amp  When the Scythian Nomades first be-came known to the Greeks they neither sowed nor reaped

                  ; they derived their subsistence from the fruits which the earth naturally produced, from the chace, and the milk and flesh of their flocks and herds

                  . The Gauls were the first branch of the Celtae who applied them-selves to agriculture; and that earliest and rudest of all arts had scarce passed the Rhine, when Caesar displayed in Germany the Roman Eagle
                     Germani agriculturae non student majorque pars victus eorem, in lacte et caseo et carne con

                  . The Britons were probably before the Ger-mans, in point of time, in the cultivation of their lands. Their vicinity to Gaul enabled them to import its arts; and their soil and climate were more favour-able to agriculture than the cold regi-ons beyond the Rhine; yet, in the days of Strabo, many of the inhabi-tants of Britain were strangers to the use of the plough
                     Quidam Britannorum hortos colendi et aliarum partium agriculturae prorsus ignari sunt. Strabo,  
                     
                  . In the infancy of agriculture, oats and barley were the only grains known in the north of

Europe

                   was known among all the branches of the Celtae, before the Greeks and Romans extended their infor-mation to the regions of the West. As the method of brewing this intoxicating liquid was not the peculiar invention of any particular country, it went under va-rious name. The German appellation is still retained in the English word Beer; and the LEAN, or LEUAN of the Scots and Irish is still famous in the rhimes of their ancient bards. Beer however was not the sole beverage of the ancient Bri-tons; their Zythus, or water diluted with

honey

                  . When the Romans extended their arms to this side of the Alps the use of wine was in-troduced among the Celtic nations. The Germans, rude as they were in the days of Tacitus, were well acquainted with the juice of the grape; and we may con-clude, from a parity of reason, that the Britons were not strangers to wine at the first settlement of the Romans in their country.
               
                  Houshold furniture. The household furniture of the Britons was neither splendid nor convenient. The best accommodated lay on flock beds or on the skins of wild beasts spread on straw, rushes, or heath; and their chairs and tables were fashioned with the axe. The ancient Germans were not peculiar in having a separate table, when they eat in private, for each person in the family
                     Apud Germanos separatae singulis sedes et sua cui-que mensa. Tacit. Germ.  xxii.
                     
                  ; at their public entertainments, they used but one table for each rank of the people invited. The old bards have transmitted

the memory of this, as a British custom, to modern times. The vessels used by our ancestors were carved out of wood or made of earth
                     Ex eadem materia (fictili) sunt patinae. Nonnul-lis patinarum loco, canistra lignea vitilibus contexta. Athenaeus,  
                     
                  . Their drinking-cups were, as has been already observed, ori-ginally either of shell or of horn
                     Vinum poculis corneis ac ligneis. Diod. Sic.
                     
                   though some more magnificent than others were possessed of goblets of silver

                  Clothing The Celtae were better clothed than some learned men have supposed, from the testimony of the ancients. Their peculiar custom of throwing away their loose garments in action gave rise to the opinion, that some of them went always naked. When the nations of antiquity first appeared in history they were but very slightly covered: the greatest part of the body was left bare; and the Persians were the first who adopted the womanish long stole of the East. In the various regions of Europe they used for clothing the materials in which the country most excelled; but the fashion of their gar-ments was universally the same.

they used linen, especially the wo-men, who sometimes wore printed gar-ments

                  , and often long robes of white. The Gauls, like the modern French, lighted in gawdiness and shew

                  ; but they rendered their garments less homely with gold and silver lace

                  . In Spain, as at present, the wool was extremely fine

                      Strabo further observes, that such was the reputation of Spanish wool, that a talent was frequently the price of a ram when sold to other nations. Strabo,  iii.
                  ; the clothing of the Spaniards, therefore, was of slighter texture, and more elegant than that of the Gauls. The inhabitants of Britain used woollen clothing; neither were they strangers to the manufacturing of linen.
               
                  Their make and fashion. The party-coloured garments

                   which the natives of the mountains of Scotland have brought down to the present times, were the universal taste among all the

the Sarmatae; who, after having passed from Scandinavia, became their neigh-bours in Germany. Instead of contend about the possession of the bleak shores of the Baltic, the Cimbri and Teutoni, in close alliance with one another, en-deavoured to procure for themselves better settlements in a more favourable climate and soil.
               
                  The Scan-dinavian Sarmatae The Teutoni were the first of the Scan-dinavian Sarmatae who invaded the South. The calamities which over-whelmed those adventurers in their ex-pedition, discouraged their countrymen for more than two complete centuries from similar attempts. In the reign of Marcus Aurelius, forgetting the misfor-tunes of their fathers, the Sarmatic Germans advanced into the regions of the South and East
                     Dio. Cass.  lxxi.
                  . A new bulwark a-gainst their invasion had started up in the power of the Romans. The military discipline of the legions stationed on the frontiers of Pannonia frustrated all the efforts of the Barbarians, and obliged them to content themselves with the cold and sterile seats of their ancestors. But though they were unsuccessful in many succeeding attempts, they never lost sight of the object, till the growing imbecillity of the empire opened the South and West to their arms.
               
                  

branches of the Celtic nation. The Sa-gum of the old Gauls and Spaniards was no other than the Scottish PLAID of various colours; the Braccae, from which a part of Gaul took its name, were the Highland Trouse, and the same with that worn by the Germans; which being strait and close to the skin, exhibited the shape of the limbs
                     Locupletissimi Germanorum veste distinguuntur strictâ singulos artus exprimente. Tacit. Germ. xvii.
                     
                  . The ancient Bri-tons, like the Germans, wore a close jacket of party-coloured cloth, which ge-nerally reached no further than the waist-band of the Trouse. This jacket had a half sleeve, which came down to the el-bow
                     Vestis alta, stricta, versicolor, vix appropinquans poplitibus (this seems to be the jacket and felibeg in one, worn by the Scots of the mountains) manicae sola brachiorum principia velantes. Sidon. Apol.  
                     
                  . The vulgar wore a kind of half-boot and shoe in one, made of raw hides, and laced fast before with small thongs

                  Dress of the women. The dress of the women was still more simple than that of the men. It consisted of a jacket without any sleeves, and a petticoat which reached down a little be-low the knee. Their bosoms were ex-posed

to view, and their arms were bare
                     Nec alius foeminis quam viris habitus, nisi quod foeminae saepius liniis amictibus velantur, eosque pur-pura variant, partemque vestitûs superioris, in manicas non extendunt nudae brachia et lacertos sed et proxima pars pectoris. Tacit. Germ.  xvii.
                     
                  . Upon public occasions they used likewise a party-coloured Sagum or PLAID of finer texture than that worn by the men; and women of condition and rank hung a chain of gold, by way of ornament, a-bout the neck

                  . In summer their jack-ets and petticoats were of linen stained with purple: In winter they were of wool, striped with different colours. Printed linens seem to be of Celtic in-vention. The Spanish ladies, in the days of Strabo, wore linen robes stained with the figures of various flowers
                     Hispanorum mulieres floridis vestibus (
                           
                        ) utuntur. Strabo,  iii.
                     
                  .
               
                  Dress of the Celtae very sumptuous. Though the Celtic nations had a par-ticular aversion to the changing of the fashion of their clothes, they became early luxurious and expensive in the article of dress. The apparel of the Gauls and Spaniards especially was extremely mag-nificent. When they wore linen it was

stamped or painted
                     Hispani linteis praetextis purpura tunicis, candori miro fulgentibus constiterant. Livius,  xxii.
                     
                   with a variety of figures in different colours; and their woollen clothes were variegated, accord to Strabo, with gold
                     
                        
                           
                         
                        Strabo,  
                     
                     —Auro virgatae vestes, Sil. Ital.  
                     
                  . The Ger-mans themselves as early as the beginning of the third century streaked their gar-ments with silver; and we may conclude that the ancient Britons were not behind the Germans in their love of finery and show
                     Germani Chlamydes argento variegatas gestant. Herod.  iii.
                     
                  .
               
                  Their neat-ness and cleanliness. The Celtae were not only neat in their dress, they were also cleanly in their per-sons. The character of dirtiness, which we annex to the Barbarians of ancient Europe, came from the East with those wild na-tions who overturned the empire of the West. The Sarmatae, who were the an-cestors of the greater part of the present inhabitants of Europe, were dirty to a proverb
                     Sordes Sarmatarum. Tacit. Germ. xlvi.
                     
                  . The Celtic nations were pe-culiarly fond of cleanliness: They bathed regularly every day
                     Statim è somno lavantur. Tacit. Germ. xxii.
                     
                     —Germani locis frigidissimis lavantur in fluminibus. Caesar,  
                     
                   in the months of winter, as well as in the heat of summer;

and they carried their love of neatness so far, that, according to Ammianus Mar-cellinus, in all the provinces of ancient Gaul, not one man or woman, even the poorest, was to be seen with patched or mended clothes
                     Tersi pari diligentiâ cuncti et mundi, nec in trac-tibus illis poterit aliquis videri, vel soemina, licet per-quam pauper, ut alibi frustis squalere pannorum. Am-mian. Marcell. 
                     
                  . The same writer gives a striking contrast to the Celtic neatness in the nastiness of the Sarmatae
                     Nec alia Hunnis domestica vestis, alia forensis, sed semel obsoleti coloris tunica collo inserta, non ante ponitur, aut mutatur, quam diuturnâ carie in pannos defluxerit, defrustata. Amm. Marcell.  xxxi.
                     
                  , whose dirty and ragged posterity croud, at this day, the streets of the most opulent cities in Europe. The cleanliness of modern nations proceeds from luxury, and is not general; it was the result of nature a-mong the Celtae, and was universal. Beggary and rags are of the improvements of advanced society.
            
            
               

               Their Houses, Navigation, and Commerce.
               
                  Form of their houses. Caesar observes, that in Britain, which at his arrival swarmed with an infinite number of inhabitants, the houses differed little in the architecture from those of the Gauls
                     Hominum in Britanniâ est infinita multitudo; creberrimaque aedificia, fere Gallicis consimilia. Caesar,  
                     
                  . The walls were constructed of boards or of hurdles

                  ; the latter of which were plastered over with different sorts of clay of various colours, red, blue, yellow, and white, which made a splendid appearance where distance prevented the meanness of the materials from offending the eye
                     Quaedam loca diligentius illinunt, terra ita pura et splendente, ut picturam ac liniamenta colorum imite-tur. Tacit. Germ.
                     
                  . They were of a circular form, the roof rose in a kind of cone to a great height, and was covered with straw

                  . In the center of these halls, which were of great size, there was supported on four pillars of wood a kind of wattled funnel, which, being plastered with clay, served

the purpose of a chimney, and carried the smoke through the conical point of the roof. This tube, which was very wide below, served in part to light the hall. The sleeping apartments, which were divided from the great hall by par-titions of planks, or of hurdles plastered with mortar, were lighted with small widows.
               
                  Stone and brick known, but little used. Stone buildings were very rare, and though brick and tile were not absolutely unknown

                  , they were little used. It is probable after the Britons began to drop the old Celtic custom of an annual divi-sion of their lands, that some of their chiefs and petty kings had more conve-nient habitations than those we have above described. The political motives which the Germans advanced for a frequent change of habitation either existed not at all, or were not so powerful in Britain as they were upon the continent. When men settle in fixed abodes for any consi-derable period of time, the conveniencies of life gradually grow up among them, and they become objects of depredation to their less cultivated neighbours. Mo-tives of safety from sudden incursions would certainly have suggested to the more

polished Britons of the South the idea of building with brick and stone even before the Romans introduced both among them with their government and arts.
               
                  The vulgar lived in huts. The inferior sort of people, as they do to this day in the mountains of Scotland, lived in mean huts
                     
                        
                           
                         
                        Dion. Cass.  xxxix.
                     
                  : the walls of these huts were of sod, and their roofs covered with a light kind of turf, which frequently stood out for twenty years together against the injuries of the weather. This rustic kind of architecture remained in Italy in the days of Virgil
                     Congestum cespite culmeu. Virg. Ecl. i.
                     
                  ; for the clowns of Mantua and Cremona lived in the turf cabins of their Celtic ancestors, at a time when Augustus boasted of having con-verted the brick edifices of Rome into marble.
               
                  Situation of their houses. In Britain, as in Gaul and Germany, the inhabitants built their houses in copses of wood
                     Circumdata sunt sylvâ domicilia Gallorum; qui vitandae aestus causâ, plerumque sylvarum ac fluminum petunt propinquitates. Caesar,  
                     
                  , to shade them from the heat of the summer, and to cover them from the violence of the winter winds. Na-turally fond of cleanliness, they always fixed their residence on the banks of some brook or river into which they plunged

every morning as soon as they rose from sleep
                     Statim è somno lavantur. Tacit. Germ.  xxii.
                     
                  .
               
                  They had no towns. The Britons had scarcely any group of houses built in one place, which could deserve the name of a town
                     
                        
                           
                         
                        Dion. Cass.  xxxix.
                     
                  , when Caesar first arrived in Britain. Like the ancient Germans, they avoided to build in con-tinued rows to shun the accidents of fire. Thick woods fenced round with a foss and wall obtained, among the Bri-tons, the name of a town
                     Oppidum Britanni vocant, quum silvas impedi-tus vallo atque fossa muniverunt. Caesar.  
                     
                  . This peculiar custom gave its origin to the word BALL, by which a town is inva-riably distinguished in the Gaëlic lan-guage; it being derived from BUAL, literally a fence or fold. It is not im-probable but, even in the days of Caesar, there might be some inconsiderable num-ber of contiguous houses on the banks of navigable rivers, and on the shores of convenient harbours. The commerce, which, even in those days, was carried on in the ports of Britain, presupposes, in some measure, the existence of villages.
               
                  Their navi-gation, The navigation of the ancient British nations was despicable, if compared with the improvements of modern times. They, however, ventured, into the ocean

in small craft of rude construction, which they managed with great dexterity
                     Etiam nunc in Britannico oceano naves vitiles co-rio circumsutae fiunt. Plin.  
                     
                  . The keels and kelsons of their long-boats, for their vessels deserved not the name of ships, were formed of slight ma-terials. The hull was made of wicker covered with raw hides
                     
                        Carinae primum et statumina ex levi materia fie-bant, reliquum corpus                               •

                  . Each end of the vessel terminated in a sharp beak, and it was rowed indiscriminately either way
                     Tacit. Germ, xlvi.
                  . They used oars
                     
                        
                           
                         
                        Pro-cop  
                     
                   for the most part, though they were not unacquainted with the sail; and they skimmed along the water with amazing facility and expedition. The size of those vessels must have been greater than is generally supposed, for the Saxon auxiliaries of Vortigern transported them-selves in three of them from Germany to Britain. As, to use a naval phrase, they could live in any sea, it is probable that some of those boats were accommodated with slight decks.
               
                  

The inhabitants of the north of Eu-rope, it is highly probable, sailed, in a very early period, in vessels of a larger size and better construction than those we have already described. The Suiones or ancient Scandinavians had their fleets in the days of Tacitus
                     Suionum civitates, in ipso oceano, classibus valent. Tacit. Germ. xlvi.
                     
                  ; and before the time of the elder Pliny, the northern nations not only ventured into the tem-pestuous seas of Norway, but even passed over into Thule, which the learned sup-pose to be the same with the modern Ice-land
                     Sunt qui et alias prodant, Scandiam, Dumnam, Bergos maximamque omnium Nerig
                           •
                         ex qua in Thulen navigetur. Plin.  
                     
                  . These voyages could not have been performed in open boats nor in hulls of wicker covered with raw hides. The art of ship-building, though perhaps in its rudest state, was known in the North when the first feeble light of history rose on its nations. Men who sailed to Thule could scarcely be unacquainted with Bri-tain; and had the inhabitants of the latter neglected an art which their maritime situation must have naturally suggested to them, they must have certainly adopted it from the Scandinavians. Rivers, narrow arms of the sea, even the British and Irish channels might be navigated in open

                  the ances-tors of the modern Germans. The Celtae beyond the Rhine were ei-ther dissipated in the dominions of Rome before the fall of the empire, or after-wards lost in the inundations of the Sarmatic Scandinavians; who, passing over Germany, overwhelmed the regions of the South and west at the decline of the Roman power. The Goths and Vandals who extended their conquests to Spain, Italy, and Africa, were, in some measure, lost in the countries which they subdued. The northern nations, descended from the same stock who trod on their heels when they moved into the provinces of the Roman empire, are the ancestors of the present Germans. The Franks, having confined their migrating expeditions to Gaul, have still preserved their Vandalic name in that country. The Saxons settled in Britain are the most unmixed of the posterity of the Sar-matae who first settled on the southern shore of the Baltic.
            
            
               

skiffs by the inhabitants of the western shores of Britain, but those on the Ger-man ocean may be supposed to have known as much of navigation as the na-tives of the opposite continent.
               
                  Their fo-reign and domestic trade; The ancient British nations carried on some degree of foreign commerce, and exported commodities and manufactures
                     
                        
                           
                         
                         Diod. Sic.  
                     
                  . The Isle of Wight seems to have been their chief mart. The tin, which Corn-wall produced in great abundance, after being smelted into bars or cubes was car-ried thither, and exported afterwards to the nearest coast of Gaul; from which it was sent by land-carriage to the mouth of the Rhone, and from thence conveyed by the Ligustic sea into Italy
                     Itinere pedestri per Galliam ostia Rhodani portant. Diod Sic.  
                     
                  . Their next great commodity was raw hides; and, after the Romans had settled in the Island, corn. Their manufactures for foreign markets consisted, in the reign of Augustus, of bridles, glass, and earthen ware, vessels made of a kind of a mixed metal, and other coarse articles, upon which the Romans raised considerable du-ties in the ports of Gaul

                  . The existence

of a mercantile intercourse with foreign-ers implies a degree of internal commerce. The ancient Britons, who ventured their small craft on the ocean, may be reason-ably supposed to have converted the con-venience, which their rivers afforded for water-carriage, to the purposes of do-mestic trade.
               
                  land carri-age and chariots. Their land-carriage was performed, as at present, by the means of carts and waggons, long before the Romans intro-duced the conveniencies
                     Diod. Sic.  
                   of life with their government. That they went in chariots to war is universally known

                  : that they used them for the convenience of travel-ling, as we do our post-chaises, is equally certain

                  . Some of those vehicles were more expensive than the tawdry equipages of modern times; for the chariots in which their petty kings fought in battle were frequently of solid silver

            GOVERNMENT OF THE ANCIENT BRITISH NATIONS.
            
               Reflections on the Origin of Go-vernment.
               
                  Rise and progress of society. SOCIETY is of greater antiquity than government. Civil regulations confess, in their own origin, the pre-existence of public crimes. Mankind, like other animals, herded originally toge-ther through mere instinct; and they ceive themselves who think that commu-ties were formed under a preconcerted system of policy. Man, in his rudest state, being destitute of property, neither fears nor meets with injustice: He pos-sesses nothing which his own arm cannot defend, before the love of the convenien-cies of life has overcome his neighbour natural propensity to justice. In the progress of society individuals polish one another, as it were, by collision. The fruit of the ingenuity of one is adopted and improved by another: New inven-tions start up in every quarter, and are

lost in none: Luxury grows with the in-crease of the arts of civil life, rapacity treads close on its heels; and then, for the first time, the check of law and re-gulation becomes necessary to the welfare, if not to the very being of the community.
               
                  Origin of monarchy. The popular form of government is more ancient than monarchy. The patri-archal authority from which some writers deduce the latter, is too much circum-scribed in degree and time to be the foun-tain from which monarchy flows. The power which a parent has over his chil-dren cannot be transmitted to his son. He derives it from nature. and it dies with himself. Regal government is a civil institution, which in various coun-tries owes its commencement to various causes. It generally takes its rise from a kind of usurpation; and, whatever theorists in politics may say, there were originally no stipulations made between the tyrant and the people. Length of time establishes into a kind of right what, at the beginning, was an act of injustice; and the acquiescence of the people con-stitutes into a moral duty that obedience which was at first the effect of fear.
               
                  Popular go-vernment older than monarchy. The simplicity of monarchical govern-ment has established with many an opi-nion of its superior antiquity. The in-fancy of society, like that of man, must be awed, say they, into good behaviour by

the fear of obvious punishment. The slow movements of popular governments command no respect, and impress no fears; and therefore men naturally place the power of the state where it can be exerted with most expedition and precision. They who argue in this manner are little ac-quainted with the character of barbarous times. In the first stage of society there is no inequality between individuals: a man mind must be opened with civili-zation before he will acquiesce in an opi-nion of his own inferiority. The Bar-barian knows no person better than him-self, and he submits to the dictates of none; deriving, in fact, from the vigour and independence of his own mind, that liberty which we owe to an accidental constitution of government.
               
                  Monarchy begins in force, and is supported by influ-ence. Though monarchy, for the most part, begins in the midst of tumult and war, the very existence of regal power presup-poses a considerable degree of civility in the community. The authority which the leader of a nation may acquire from personal merit in battle will die away in peace, unless the machine is kept in mo by the continued impulse of influ-ence; and this influence, which is the foundation, if not the origin, of kingly government, is only to be obtained by having something to bestow upon abettors and dependents. A few being gained.

through the channel of interest, the many are over-awed into submission; and that lenity and impartial justice, which pru-dence dictates in the first periods of mo-narchy, contributes to reconcile the minds of the people to the government of one.
               
                  Origin and nature of the popular form of go-vernment. In the early infancy of a state, the only laws that subsist in the community are the opinions and prejudices of the people. Before property is well established, the catalogue of crimes is very succinct; and the punishments annexed to each are nei-ther severe nor inflicted with precision. The people have not yet delegated their authority to a few; and the power that remains in the hands of the many seldom exerts itself with vigour. The society is kept together more by habit, and the ab-sence of vice, than by any thing which deserves the name of government. The people, who have the whole power in their hands, convene only when they are to carry war into an enemy country, or to defend their own. They consult together but on the external affairs of the community; its internal concerns are left to the opinions of individuals. This ab-sence of all regulation may be called the most ancient form of government; and it may be distinguished by the title of a popular government, as the opinions of the people in general are the only checks upon the crimes and irregularities of in-dividuals.
            
            
               

               Form of the Ancient British Government.
               The Ancient British nations, like the rest of the inhabitants of the North of Europe, were extremely fond and very tenacious of their political freedom. Though, from a conviction that civil society cannot maintain itself without subordination, they had their judges, their princes, and kings, the power of those dignified persons was very much circum-scribed
                     Nec regibus infinita aut libera potestas. Tacit. Germ.
                     
                  . In the midst of barbarity they formed as just notions of liberty as other free nations have done in the most culti-vated times. They were convinced, that they not only had a right to elect their magistrates
                     Eliguntur in iisdem conciliis et principes, qui jura per pagos, vicosque reddunt. Tacit. Germ. xii.
                     
                  , but also to prescribe those laws by which they chose to be governed. The actions of the individual were cogni-zable by the BREHON or judge; the judge was accountable for his conduct to the general assembly of the people
                     Coeunt omnes certis diebus. Tacit. xi.
                     
                  .
               
                  

                  love of li-berty. The Celtae in general were such enthu-siasts on the article of public freedom, that they affirmed it was the natural pro-perty of animals as well as of men
                     Libertatem natura, mutis etiam animalibus datam. Civilis apud Tacit.   
                     
                  . Their love of liberty was one of the rea-sons they gave for their aversion to indus-try and the accumulation of property; for he that wishes to be free, said the Scy-thians, ought to have nothing that he is afraid to lose"
"                        Nihil parare quod amittere timeant. Justin.  "
"                        "
"                     . Poverty is certainly the best bulwark against tyranny; nor were our ancestors much mistaken when they believed that the man who loves riches is capable of selling his liberty for money. The Celtae through all their branches preferred their freedom to life it-self. The first maxim in war was to maintain their independance, or to prevent slavery by a voluntary death
                     Nec aliud sibi reliquum quam tenere libertatem, aut mori ante servitutem. Tacit. Ann.  
                     
                  .
               
                  Their kings The department of the prince was to lead in war; in peace he sunk into an equality with others. Instead of con-sidering his will and pleasure as a living law, they paid him no obedience but what he derived from their opinion of his merit
                     Reges auctoritate suadendi magis quam jubendi potestate. Tacit. Germ.
                     
                  . They seemed to consider the

chief magistrate, even after his authority had extended itself to times of tranquility, to be only the guardian of those customs which occupied the place of laws. Their kings had no public revenue, and they stood in need of none when the subject attended them in war at his own expence; if indeed the equipping of an ancient Bri-ton for depredatory expeditions required any expence at all.
               
                  Their gene-ral assem-blies. It is certain that the ancient Britons, like their brethren on the continent, had their general assemblies of the people, in which all affairs of public concern were decided by the plurality of voices
                     
                        
                           
                         Statu po-pulari plurimum reguntur. Dion. Cass. Caledoniis,  lxxvi.
                     
                     —Coeunt certis diebus. Tacit. Germ.
                     
                      majoribus omnes. Tacit. Germ.
                     
                     —Anti-quitus unum quotannis principem, itemque belli du-cem multitudo diligebat. Strabo Gallis,  
                     
                  . In the small states into which they were sub-divided, it was not impossible for the majority of those of perfect age to convene upon important occasions. Their resolu-tions must, in the nature of things, have been tumultuary and precipitate. They met principally for the purpose of making war, and they rushed with little delibera into a state which they naturally loved. Domestic affairs were seldom the subject of debate; for a people before the esta-blishment

of landed property and a con-siderable degree of commerce can scarcely be said to have any domestic affairs.
               
                  Origin of representa  The greatest improvements in politics rise from very simple and rude beginnings. When the state became extensive and po-pulous, it was impossible for all its mem-bers to convene in general assemly. The expedient of delegation was obvious, and was naturally adopted; and length of time polished into what is called a con-vention of the states the democratical meetings of the Celtic nations. The legates being freed of the interruptions and confusions incident to the assemblies of the populace, found leisure to deter-mine upon domestic as well as foreign matters; and this was the source of these civil regulations we distinguish by the name of laws.—In the darkness which involves our remotest ancestors it is im-possible to trace their government through all its departments with precision. The absence of those vices which exist only in polished society was probably the chief cause of the domestic tranquility
                     Diod. Sic. Britannis,  
                   which they enjoyed. Crimes, to use at once a paradox and a metaphor, are the parents of civil regulations; and necessity, which is said to have no law, is the source of all law.
            
            
               

               The Slavi.
               
                  Reflections. When fate had decreed the fall of the Romans she seemed to create Barbarians for the single purpose of executing her favourite design. Nations appeared sud-denly on the frontiers of the empire un-heard of by others, and even unknown to themselves. The memory of their former transactions was lost in their own ignorance, and the name of their original seats was as it were forgot in the length of their march. They seemed to move forward under an impression of the incon-veniences they had left at home, more than from the hopes of success abroad; having philosophy enough to prefer the uncertainty of future evils to present mi-sery.
               
                  Origin and progress of the Slavi. The most obscure of those Barbarians who contributed to the destruction of the western empire were the Slavi, whose posterity now possess all the regions be-tween the Euxine and the Frozen Ocean. Under the name of Avari they advanced even as far as Peloponnesus in the fifth century, and under that of Bulgarians they continued their irruptions into the South till the end of the eighth age. Pursuing and flying from one another, in successive mi-grations, they filled the western Russia,

               Their Justice.
               
                  Man by na-ture just. Man is by nature just. The love of pleasure, and the conveniences of civil life, warp his soul in advanced society from the principles of rectitude and im-partiality. The Celto-Scythians are re-presented by the ancients as the most just and equitable of men. The unbiassed feelings of a mind uncorrupted by selfish passions supply the place of civil regulati-on, and are even better than the coercive power of laws. The security derived from the innate integrity of men is more pleasing than that which arises from their fears

                  . The nation that boasts of the multiplicity and salutariness of its regu-lations conveys satire in self-applause; and, though the paradox is not in all cases just, we may venture to affirm, that those who have the best laws often need them the most

                  Simplicity and integri-ty of the Britons The open simplicity and integrity of the ancient Britons met with the approba of those who were most their foes; and they yielded not to the Celtae on the continent in their ideas and practice of justice between man and man. The stranger, the traveller, and the merchant, were secure in their persons and property, not by the severity of legal punishments, but from the natural propensity of the people to justice. Theft and robbery within the territory of the community were reckoned unpardonable crimes; be-beyond the limits of the state they took the name of depredatory war, and were covered with honour and renown
                     Latrocinia nullam habent infamiam, quae extra fines cujusque civitatis fiunt. Caesar,  
                     
                  .
               
                  confined to their domes-tic conduct. In commending the justice and integrity of our ancestors we must confine our ap-plause to their conduct at home. To take every advantage of an enemy was one of their invariable maxims; and to carry devastation and death into the territory of their neighbours upon every slight occa-sion was, instead of being thought dis-honourable, attended with fame. Though they did not, like the American Indians, excuse their cruelties by an aversion to war, for, on the contrary, it was the amuse-ment and business of their lives, they fre-quently

committed barbarities which can admit of little apology. To alleviate the weight of this reflection it ought to be observed, that the oppressions of the Ro-mans, in the first period of their govern-ment in Britain, were sufficient to raise a spirit of implacable revenge in minds less irascible and haughty than those of the ancient British nations. Neither were the Celtae, in any one of their branches, very tenacious of the faith of treaties; their fickle disposition, and ardent love of liberty, rendered them careless in their observation of conditions imposed upon them in their misfortunes

                  Faithful in the service of foreign-ers. Notwithstanding this defect in their public faith, they boasted frequently, and with justice, of the inviolable sincerity of their professions
                     Nullos mortalium armis aut ante illos esse. Tacit. Ann.  xiii.
                     
                  . Their fidelity and at-tachment to the foreign princes whom they served in war were without bounds, and beyond example. It must however be confessed, that gratitude for favours received had a greater influence upon their conduct in this respect, than a regard for the virtues of the person whose arms they bore. A Nero
                     Sueton. Neron. xxxiv.
                  , a Vitellius, a Cara-calla, were equally loved, and served with

as much attachment as an Antonine, by the Celtic Germans; and the Britons, when they obeyed the Romans, made no distinction between a lawful prince and an usurper.—The ancient British na-tions were equitable, just, open, and sin-cere, in private life; in their public trans-actions, like their Celtic neighbours on the continent, they were sometimes trea-cherous and cruel. The pale of their own dominions comprehended almost all their good qualities; they carried no vir-tue, except valour, into the territory of their enemies.
               
                  Their ap-peal to the sword. There was a species of theocracy a-mong the Celtae, as well as among the old Jews. Though they had magistrates and courts of justice, there was an autho-rity superior to both, to which, in doubt-ful cases, they appealed. When either the question of right or matter of fact, was not perfectly clear, the parties cided the suit by the sword

                  . Even wit-nesses, when they did not agree in their testimonies, were often obliged to settle the difference in their evidence by single combat. The decision of arms was rec-koned

more unerring than that of the ma-gistrate: The appeal was to providence, and the judgment was that of God. To such a pitch of extravagance was this pe-culiar custom carried, that the candidates for public offices in the community, when their merit appeared to be equal, trust their respective pretensions to the deci-sion of the sword

            LANGUAGE OF THE ANCIENT BRITISH NATIONS.
            
               General Observations.
               
                  Nations te-nacious of original tongues. NATIONS are not so tenacious of their customs and manners as they are of their aboriginal tongues. The first may gradually vanish in the growing improvements of civil life; the latter can only be buried in the same grave with the people themselves. Conquest may con-fine the bounds of a language; commerce may corrupt it; new inventions, by in-troducing new words, may throw the old into disuse; a change in the mode of thinking may alter the idiom: but the ex-tirpation of those who speak any ori-nal tongue is the only means, by which it can be entirely destroyed, even where letters have been altogether un-known. It retires from successful inva-sion

into rocks and desarts; it subsists with the remains of a people; even moun-tains and rivers in part retain it when the people are no more.
               
                  The Latin not the mo-ther of the language of France, &amp  That the Romans established their own language, in the regions of the West and North which submitted to their arms, is a position which the learned scarce ever doubted, and which the rest of the world still implicitly believe. The Latin has been considered as the fountain from which the Italian, French, and Spanish, derive their origin; and it must be con-fessed, that, in a confined degree, the opinion is extremely just. It is however certain, that this mark of their own great-ness, which the Romans seem to have left in the conquered provinces, proceeded more from the reputation of their litera-ture than from the power of their arms. The illustrious nation had too much sense to endeavour to impose their own language upon the conquered; and, had they even departed from their usual political prudence on that head, it is scarcely credible, that they could have succeeded in the attempt. All other conquering nations, to whom history extends its information, failed in their endeavours of the same kind. The victors have often adopted the tongue of the vanquished; but the vassals have scarce ever been known to drop their own language for that of their lords.
               
                  

                  proved from collateral examples. The Arabs who conquered Persia, the Persians who subdued India, the Tartars who extended their empire over China, the Turks who reign in Greece and its Isles, have not been able to establish their own language in their conquests. The servants of the court, the attendants of the prince, the posterity of the victors, in general, may retain the tongue of their original country; but the bulk of the peo-ple will also retain that which descended to them from their fathers. The Ro-mans themselves could never extend the Latin to the Provinces of the East; on the contrary, the language of their Greek vassals prevailed, at last, over their own. The obstinate despotism of William the Conqueror, and the perseverance of those Norman and French princes who succeed him in the throne of England, could not force the language of France on the English nation; and the Lombards and Franks lost their own Sarmatic dialect in the tongues of Italy and Gaul. The cause is as obvious as the fact is true. The number of the conquerors bore no proportion to the vanquished; and, in the article of language, the majority al-ways prevails.
               
                  Cause of the connection of the French, &amp  with the Latin. The connection between the Latin and the languages of Spain, France, and mo-dern Italy, must be traced to another source than the government of Rome.

The nations who inhabited those exten-sive regions originally, and whose poste-rity still, in a great degree, possess them, were, in fact, the same people with the Romans. Those Gaël, who in Italy went under the name of Umbri, were partly the ancestors of the Banditti who settled with Romulus on the banks of the Tiber. The Romans, in their own a-version to commerce, vindicate, in part, their Celtic origin against their pretended descent from the Greeks of Magna Grae-cia, who were in some measure a commer-cial people. Some of their own wri-ters join issue with us in this opinion. Their language, though tinctured with Hellenisms, is radically different from the Greek; and we shall, in a subsequent section, have occasion to shew, that the primitives of the Latin tongue differ not materially from the language of a branch of the Celtae, to whom neither the litera-ture nor the government of Rome ever extended themselves.
               
                  The Celtic once the universal language in Europe. A similarity in the language of different nations is, of itself, sufficient to establish the certainty of their common origin, Were all the historical monuments of the English and Germans, by some accident, lost, the identity of the radical words common to the language of both, would convince mankind that one of those nati-ons must have originally migrated from

the other. When the Romans threw the first light on the immense track of coun-try which they distinguished by the name of Celtica, the same language as well as the same manners prevailed over the whole. The Aestiones, who inhabited Prussia and the banks of the Vistula, spoke nearly the same dialect with the ancient British nations
                     Dextero Suevici maris litore Aestiorum gentes alu-untur: quibus ritus habitus Suevorum, lingua Britan-nicae proprior. Tacit. Germ. xlv.
                     
                  ; and the Bastarnae and Scor-disci who lived on the Danube, differed not much in their language from the Aesti-ones
                     Scordisci Galli. Strabo,

                  . The Britons, in the days of Tacitus, spoke a dialect of the Celtic little different from that of Gaul
                     Sermo haud multum diversus. Tacit. Agric. xi.
                     
                  ; the Go-thini of Silesia retained the marks of their Gallic origin in their tongue
                     Gothinos Gallica lingua coarguit. Tacit. Germ. xliii.
                     
                  . The in-habitants of Spain, if we except the Ibe-rians, were Gauls or Celtae, and must of course have spoken a dialect of the lan-guage of Gaul
                     Galli occidua Europae usque Gades incolunt. Strabo,  
                     
                  ; and the Gallo-Graeci of the lesser Asia, being in some measure the descendants of the Bastarnae and Scor-disci, must have retained a part, at least, of the tongue of their ancestors
                     Justin. xxxii.
                  . From

Poland, and the regions near the mouths of the Danube, with their colonies; and, having at last settled in fixed abodes, started up into several powerful nations. Some of them extended themselves as far as Dalmatia and Illyricum, and at this moment, speak the language of their an-cestors on the Adriatic.
               
                  A different people from the Euro-pean Sar-matae. The Slavi seem, from their language as well as manners, to derive their origin from the Tartars of the North-East of Asia. They were a very different race of men from the Scandinavian Sarmatae, the principals in the migrating expediti-ons which proved fatal to the Roman power. When the Goths, quitting their native seats to the East of the Vistula, had advanced into Rhetia, Gaul, and Italy, the Slavi took possession of their habitations
                     Ubi ergo Poloniam finem facit, pervenitur Sla-vorum amplissimam provinciam.
                  . Growing numerous in Russia and Poland they extended them-selves to the South-West; and, if we regard their numbers and extent of do-minion, they form, at this day, one third of the weight in the scale of Europe.—This short account of the origin of the Slavi, though foreign to our present subject, comes in, with some propriety, in the revolutions which happened of old in the North.
            
            
               

the pillars of Hercules to the mouth of the Danube, from the Hellespont almost to the Baltic, one language though in a great variety of dialects, prevailed; and, from that circumstance, should no other proof be produced, we may conclude, that all the nations who possessed that im-mense extent of country sprung originally from one and the same source.
               
                  The Latin descended from it in part. It is more natural to suppose that the Latin owes, in part, its origin to one of the dialects of the great and general tongue which pervaded ancient Europe, than that it was formed by a few vaga-bonds who assembled together, for self-defence, on the shores of the Tiber. Some visionary pedants have been known to attempt the creation of a new language; illiterate men have always contented themselves with that which has been transmitted to them by their ancestors. In the progress of society, in the growth of inventions, a language is polished in its phrases, and enriched in the number of its words; but its first rude elements remain in its primitives, and serve to point out the fountain from which it originally flowed.
            
            
               

               The Language of Ancient Britain.
               
                  General re-flections. Time, which effectuates a change in every thing, has a peculiar influence on language. In the less polished periods of society it grows gradually with advancing civilization; and, like those who speak it, it becomes corrupted through improve-ment. When literature and philosophy arrive at their height, for even these, like all human inventions, have their bounds, men of genius, as it were, arrest language in its progress, and secure, by their writ-ings, its permanency to future ages. They put their seals upon it, and send it down to posterity in a kind of independence on accident. Before the establishment of li-terature, or where it is imperfectly known, language, having no standard by which it can be fixed, fluctuates with the chang manners of the society; and the longer it runs down through time, it departs the further from its primitive simplicity.
               
                  Cause of di-versity of dialects. To this circumstance, and not to a difference of origin, we must ascribe that diversity of dialects which Julius Caesar found in Gaul. The Aquitani
                     
                        
                           
                         
                        Strabo,  
                     
                   were

not understood by the Belgae, nor could the Celt, at the foot of the Alps, hold any conversation with the Gaul at the mouths of the Rhine; yet no writer has ever af-firmed that all Gaul was not possessed by one and the same people, though di-vided into separate states. The truth is, the identity of languages does not consist in their being mutually understood by the nations who speak them, but in the simi-larity discernible between the names of things which are common to all countries, and to every stage of societyStrabo says, that the nations of Gaul differed very little from one another in point of language

                  . The Doric of Syracuse was not intelligible at Miletus; the Dutch can hold no discourse with the Silesians; yet the Sicilian and Ionian were Greeks; and one and the same nation possess the upper and lower Germany.
               
                  Three in Britain at the arrival of the Ro-mans. We have, in a preceding section, ob-served that Gaul and the lower Germany had sent colonies into Britain, at three different periods, before the arival of the Romans in the Island. The posterity of these must have differed considerably from one another in point of language. The Gaël, who still exist in North-Britain and Ireland, passed from the continent before

the arts of civil life had made any great progress in Gaul; and, in some measure, retain the unimproved language of their ancestors. The second colony were the posterity of those Gauls, who, being an-ciently settled beyond the Rhine, returned into the regions of the South, under the name of Cimbri. The Cumri of Wales are their descendants; and they preserve in their tongue, a tincture of the Sarma-tic of the East and North. The British Belgae spoke that dialect of the language of Gaul which still subsists among their posterity in lower Britanny. The three dialects which we have just mentioned, have been thought by many learned wri-ters to be the only genuine remains of the ancient Celtic; and others have added to these the language of the mountaineers of Asturias and Gallicia. Some have even gone so far as to affirm that these four languages are reciprocally understood by the Scots, Irish, and Welsh, the inhabi-tants of Britany, and the Spaniards who border on the Bay of Biscay.
               
                  Observati-ons on the Biscayan, Armorican, Welsh, &amp  The opinion is not just: The Biscayan has not even the most distant connection with the Celtic; the other languages rive, it is certain, their origin from one source: they agree in many radical words, but their idioms are different. The Welshman is as ignorant of the Gaëlic as the Spaniard of Arragon is of the dia-lect

of Dauphiny; and the Scot knows no more of the language of Britany, than the inhabitant of Palermo does of the tongue of Portugal.—In vain have the learned had recourse to the rude dia-lects of the Celtic, which remain in Bri-tanny and Wales, to form upon them some idea of that language. What they sought after with so much eagerness a-broad, was every day in their hands at home. The language of the Romans sprung originally in part from the Celtic stock; and the French, Italians, and Spaniards speak, in some measure, to this day, the tongue of their Celtic ancestors. To render the first part of the position pro-bable, is to prove the latter beyond the power of reply.

                  , were in possession of a great part of the lower Italy before the foundation of Rome was

laid. These were the same with the A-borigines, whose peculiar and rude man-ner of life bore testimony of their Celtic origin. When the Greeks, from their possession of the arts which they had re-ceived from Phoenicia and Egypt, began to multiply their numbers in Peloponnesus and the Islands of the Archipelago, they sent abroad colonies who settled on the shore of the lower Italy, and carried on some commerce in its ports. Out of the vagabonds of these two very different sets of men Romulus collected the founders of Rome. The mixed manners, and the mixed language of the Romans, prove their double origin, and furnish a kind of demonstration that the illustrious nation derived their blood from the Celtae, as well as from the Greeks of Magna Grae-cia
                     Veresimile barbarici etiam generis reliquias nonnullas vicinis et priscis incolis cum Graecis se conjunxisse. Dionys. Halic.  
                      Be that as it will, the Sabins were received into the city of Rome under Titus Tatius; and the Sabins were Umbri, and the Umbri Gaël..
               
                  They rived in part their lan-guage from the Celtae. The Latin derives many of its roots and primitive words from the Greek; it also draws some from the ancient Celtic. The Scots of Caledonia were never sub-dued by the Romans; and they had little connection with that illustrious people. The Roman language cannot be supposed

to have penetrated where neither the lite-rature nor the arms of Rome ever entered; yet there is a wonderful similarity, if not a perfect identity, between many primitives in the Gaëlic, and others that correspond with them exactly in the Latin tongue. This circustance seems to demonstrate, that the Gallic Umbri of Italy, who were partly the ancestors of the Romans, and the Gaël of Caledonia, who were the sole ancestors of the ancient Scots, swarm originally from the same hive.

It is observable that the of the Latin is pronounced invariably like in the Gaëlic language; which is a kind of proof that the Romans pronounced it in the same way; for instance, the Latin Cera, (wax) is pronounced KER in the Galic, though it is always written Ger.

               Reflections on the Origin of the European Nations.
               
                  The Celtae, the Sarma-tae, and Slavi, The succinct account given of the state of Ancient Europe lays open the secret springs from which its modern inhabitants derive their blood. The polished nations who now excel antiquity itself in arts, and vie with it in arms, owe their origin to rude Barbarians, whose want of means of trans-mitting their history to posterity has per-haps contributed to their fame. The Celtae, the Sarmarae, and Slavi, jumbled together by migration, conquest, and ac-cidents of various kinds, formed that great mass which has started up, in the course of ages, into those powerful and illustrious states which figure, at this day, in Europe.
               
                  the ances-tors of the European nations, Though scarce any one people from the pillars of Hercules to the Tanais are free from a mixture of the three great original nations whom we have so often mentioned, there are regions in that vast extent of country where the blood of each peculiarly prevails. The Celtae, whom their connection with the Romans had abandoned to conquest in Gaul, Spain, Italy, and its isles, are the ancestors of the majority of the present inhabitants of those extensive countries.

                  A remark. This catalogue might be extended to a much greater length, but nothing can be more tedious and unentertaining than a dry list of words. To remove every ground of supposition that the Scots of either of the British Isles borrowed any part of their language from the Latin it is necessary to observe, that almost every one word in the Gaëlic column is either a compound or derivative from some well known primitive in that language. The Gaëlic primitives are all monosyllables. Wherever a word of more syllables than one presents itself it is a compound; and all the adjectives are formed, by the dition of some termination or other, to a substantive noun.
               
                  Reflections To draw, in this place, a parallel be-tween the Gaëlic, the Welch, and the language of Britanny, would not even have novelty to recommend it. The ingenious Mr. Lhud comparative vocabulary is already in the hands of the curious; and to such as are not fond of philological dis-quisition it is sufficient to observe, that the three languages, though not recipro-cally understood by the Scots, Welch, and the inhabitants of Britanny, are evi-dently descended from that tongue which

the nations of Gaul carried in their mi-grations to every quarter of Europe. It is even demonstrable, were not the sub-ject foreign to this Introduction, that the Italian, Spanish, and especially the mo-dern French, owe their origin, to speak in a confined sense, more to the ancient Celtic than to the Latin, which was itself, in part, a dialect of that language.
            
         
         
            

            AN INQUIRY INTO THE Origin of the Anglo-Saxons.
            
               Preliminary Observations.
               
                  Obscurity of the remote antiquities of the Sax-ons. THE remote antiquities of the Saxons lie buried in the darkness which involved, in ancient times, the inhabitants of the northern Europe. Without the means of transmitting any account of themselves to posterity; at a distance from those nations who possessed the use of letters, their transactions were either lost in obscurity or disfigured with fable. In their progress towards the South, they gradually rose, as it were, from night; the light of history broke in upon them; and we see them, for the first time, in that rude form which a fierce combination of Barbarians wear in migra and depredatory war. After the soil and climate of Britain had attached them to fixed abodes, their natural ferocity was

mellowed down by degrees; the arts of civil life began to appear; and they were among the first of the European nations who committed their history to writing, and even whose transactions were worthy of being recorded.
               
                  Apology and design The character, private life, and govern-ment of the Anglo-Saxons, after their settlement in this island, furnish an am-ple field for disquisition; the monuments which remain of their history on the continent are few in number; and the subject itself is, in some measure, barren, from its high antiquity. But as nothing that concerns a people who have made so great and splendid a figure can be unin-teresting, either to themselves or the world, the Author of the Introduction hopes to screen his own want of abilities behind the importance of his subject. He even presumes to think that he has thrown some additional light on those an-tiquities which he has endeavoured to re-present in their least forbidding form. Should his confining himself to the his-tory and manners of the Saxons in their rudest state be the chief objection to his work, he may perhaps remove it by scending hereafter into a more fruitful period: should the objection, on the other hand, arise from any defect in himself, he will derive some happiness from the

thoughts of having spent but little time, in a province where he failed to please.
               
                  of the Author, To investigate the origin of the Anglo-Saxons, to pursue their progress from Scandinavia with precision, it may not be improper to throw together some reflec-tions on the fall of the Romans; the cline of whose power opened the regions of the West to the migrations of the Barbarians of the northern Europe.
            
            
               Reflections on the Fall of the Romans.
               
                  Cause of the stability of the Ro-man empire, The Romans differed not more from other nations in the rise and progress, than in the extent and permanence of their power. The fall of the republic, by melting down into one mass all distinc-tions of party, gave stability and weight to the state, when it destroyed the im-portance of the members of which it was composed. Feeble and corrupted in the center, the empire threw all its vigour and strength into its frontier, and became formidable abroad in the midst of domestic decay. The disputes about the purple, though frequent and bloody, were but partial shocks; they agitated and disturb  but did neither break nor ruin the great fabric of the state. The storms were violent, but they did not last long;

and things were soon restored to their original balance by the tranquility of ab-solute government.
               
                  In what dif-ferent from other mo-narchies. The despotic empires of Asia raised by the abilities of one prince fall through the weakness of another: the fate of the state is involved with the life of the mo-narch, and when he dies in battle, or by the hands of the assassin, the great body, of which he was the head, submits to a foreign conqueror, or separates into petty principalities under domestic tyrants. The imperial authority at Rome stood upon a more solid foundation. When the Julian family reduced the Roman re-public into an empire for themselves, they did not change in appearance the ancient form of government. Though a new power started up in the state, all the old offices remained. Despotism had the cency to cover oppression with a mask, and to execute its most rigorous plans through channels neither unknown nor formidable in the days of freedom. The power of the first Caesars consisted in influence; and an overawed and venal senate were the obvious instruments of their tyranny.
               
                  Why the permanency of the em-pire The interference of the imperial au-thority was confined to matters of state. The detail of inferior government, the course of justice between individuals re-mained in the possession of ancient forms. The oppressions of the worst of the Caesars

scarce ever extended beyond the walls of Rome; and the provinces which had lan-guished under the exactions of republican praefects flourished under the lieutenants of a Caligula and a Nero. Though, vested with the sacredness of his tri
                     •…
                  uni-tian authority, no laws could bind the emperor, the empire itself was governed, in fact, by a regular system of laws; and therefore, when the tyrant fell, the state was not involved in his ruin.
               
                  did not pend on the fate of the prince. There was one other cause which pre-vented the permanence of the Empire from depending on the fate of the prince. The hereditary succession, which the Julian family endeavoured to establish, expired with Nero; and the suffrage of the army, confirmed by the approbation of a timid and complying senate, became the only necessary title to the throne. Men raised by accidental influence to the imperial dignity, though they inforced obedience, could command neither respect nor attachment from a people among whom they themselves had been so lately numbered as private persons. The mul-titude, who are, in every age and nation, the great supporters of hereditary mo-narchy, found no resting-place for their loyalty in the fluctuations of imperial succession; and they acquiesced, without reluctance, in the government of any ambitious leader, who had paved his way

to the purple by private treachery or by open force.
               
                  The exten-sion of the freedom of the city the first cause of decline. One of the best of those, who held the reins of government at Rome, has-tened the dissolution of the empire more than the very worst of his predecessors. The first Antonine, by extending the freedom of the city toDion Cassius says, that this was the act of Ant. Cara-calla, but other writers of credit affirm the contrary. It was only, perhaps, the freedom of Latium that was extended to the provinces by Antoninus Pius; that of the city by Caracalla. all the provinces, broke down the fence of distinction which, even in the midst of degeneracy, protected some small remains of the old Roman spi-rit. When the exclusive privilege of ci-tizens was no longer confined to Italy, the awe which the conquered nations had for the original seat of greatness gradually decayed. When, to be born within the walls of Rome no longer conferred any peculiar immunities, that mysterious tie, which bound the attachment of the citi-zen himself to the residence of his an-cestors, was broken; and the veneration once annexed to the Roman name became naturally feeble, when the name itself was diffused over half the world.
               
                  The absence of all spirit in the pro-vinces. But this cause of dissolution was neither obvious in its commencement nor rapid in its progress. The total absence of all

spirit in the provinces balanced, for some time, its decline in Italy. The debility which tyranny and luxury carried from Rome through all its dominions, even contributed, though the opinion is singu-lar, to the permanency and stability of the empire. The conquered nations, by be deprived of their arms, applied them-selves to those enervating arts, which, by administering to luxury, deprave when they polish the human mind. Timid and habituated to submission, they fell in love with the tranquillity of despotism; and in a kind of determination to conti-nue slaves, they became indifferent about the title and virtues of their tyrant. The news of his accession was enough to stablish the authority of any prince in the most distant regions of the empire; and many provinces were so dispirited and passive, that a military force was found altogether unnecessary to secure their obe-dience. No attempt at independence could be made by such an inactive body. Men were either ignorant of the natural rights of their species, or meanly resigned them for the abject security of servitude.
               
                  The general debility spreading to the army. The infectious debility which had seized the other subjects of Rome, did not, for some centuries after the extinction of liberty, overwhelm its armies. Born in the more distant parts of the empire, and stationed on its frontier, the soldier

Vandals, who, under a great variety of national names, succeeded the Romans in the dominion of the South and West, bore no proportion to the conquered. They introduced among their new sub-jects their own form of government, their own regulations, the haughty ferocity of their character and manners, that want of neatness
                     Sordes Sarmatarum. Tacit. Germ. xlvi.
                     
                   which all the improvements of civilized times have not hitherto been able to remove; but the language of the vassals, a certain evidence of their supe-riority in point of numbers, prevailed, at last, over that of their lords.
               
                  proved from In Germany, from the source of the Elb to the Baltic, from the Vistula to the ocean; in England, in a great part of Scotland, the old Scandinavians, with little mixture, prevail. In the kingdoms of Norway and Sweden the blood of the ancient Sarmatae is tinctured with that of the Slavi, who stept into the vacant ha-bitations of those tribes that successively, for many ages, discharged themselves into the regions of the South from both the shores of the Baltic. The dominions of the Slavi we have already described.

was a stranger to those enervating vices which extinguish the martial spirit. When the legions followed an ambitious leader to Rome, a dismission from service was the common reward of their fidelity; and if they were depraved by licence, they were soon dissipated and lost in the ge-neral imbecillity of the body of the peo-ple. They were succeeded in the presi-dial provinces by new levies of hardy and uncorrupted barbarians, who preserved an appearance of vigour in the extremi-ties of the empire, after the center had exhibited every symptom of political cay.
               
                  The remo-val of the seat of go-vernment. The impolitic vanity of Constantine, in removing the seat of empire to a new capital, gave a mortal blow to the Ro-man state. The senate, whose conse-quence and authority had declined with their virtue, were, in some measure, an-nihilated by being transplanted to another place. The name, even the very walls of Rome, contained something within them which commanded obedience from the provinces. The opinion which sup-ports all government was destroyed, by turning the attention of the people to a quarter to which they were not accus-tomed to look. They were habituated to obey implicitly the mandates of Ro-man emperors and Roman senates; but to Bizantine princes and assemblies they

paid only that cold and unwilling obe-dience which force extorts from slaves. To complete at once the ruin of that mighty fabric which the policy and vir-tue of ancient Rome had raised, Constan-tine, by creating new offices and by changing the names of many of the old, altered the constitution of the Roman government This prince, in short, who covered with splendid exploits, in public life, the meanness and even wickedness of his private character, was more fatal to the permanancy of the Roman power, especially in the West, than the most wretched and impolitic of his predecessors in the imperial dignity.
               
                  gives a mor-tal blow to the empire. Julian, though endued with all the spi-rit, abilities, and even virtues of the old Romans, came too late into the world to stop the rapid progress of the state to its decline. His untimely death extinguish the last hopes of Rome. The vigour and prudence with which he conducted his measures in his early youth serve only to shew what he might have been in his riper years. Had he lived, there was a chance for the future permanency of the empire, a certainty of its temporary greatness. He fell, and the whole fabric of Roman power nodded to its fall when he died. The circumscribed abilities of some of his successors supported, for a few years, a part of the venerable ruin; but

with every rude blast that rushed from the North and East some shattered frag-ment fell. Province was cut off after province, till the mutilated body at last expired, when Rome itself was taken and sacked by the Goths.
            
            
               General Reflections on the Sarmatae.
               
                  Of the Bar-barians who were the secondary cause of the fall of Rome. The bad policy of Constantine and the imbecillity which gradually arose from advanced civility and slavery, though they were the great, were not the only, cause of the ruin of Rome. The Barbarians of the North and East, who have even pervaded the regions of Asia itself with their migrations, gave the finishing blow to a state already tottering to its fall. Wandering like beasts of prey on the skirts of their own deserts, they saw the luxuries which prevailed within the Ro-man pale, and they made many attempts to break into the fold. Whilst vigour and discipline remained among the legions on the frontiers, they repelled with ease the irregular incursions of the naked Tar-tars of the North and East. But after the general effeminacy had extended itself to the army, enemies who, in the better days of Rome, were despised, became formidable and victorious. The fence being once broken down, the deluge soon

spread over the provinces of the West; and that great fabric which was the work of many centuries, fell in less than the space of one.
               
                  The obscu-rity in which they were invol-ved. It were in vain to attempt to penetrate the darkness which involved, at home, the Sarmatae, who succeeded the Romans in the regions of the West. Destitute of means of conveying their own annals to posterity, the first feeble light of history was thrown upon them when they shewed themselves, in a hostile manner, on the frontiers of the empire. The writers who have sent down the earliest ac-count of their invasions, astonished at their appearance, and alarmed at their cru-elties, seem to have been more anxious to describe what they then were, than what they had formerly been. They pushed not their inquiry into the origin of Bar-barians whose ravages conveyed the first news of their name; and they were little solicitous about examining into the previous history of a rude race of men, whose in-cursions into the Roman territories were perhaps their first public transaction. To supply, in some measure, this defect in the latter writers of Rome, we must return to antiquity, and recapitulate some part of what has been already advanced concern the state of Ancient Europe.
               
                  Europe pos-sessed origi-nally by the Celtae and Sarmatae: When the Greeks and Romans had ex-tended their inquiries beyond the Danube and the Alps, they found, in the vast

track of country which they distinguished by the name of Scythia, two nations dif-ferent from one another in manners, customs, and language. To the inhabi-tants of the regions of the  East and North-East of the Danube they gave the name of Sarmatae; the Celtae extended them-selves to the West and the ocean. The character of the Sarmatae, and their man-ner of life, was as opposite to those of the Celtae as the barbarism common to both could permit.
               
                  the contrast between their cha-racters. The Sarmatae, like the Celtae, made war the business of their lives; but their troops consisted altogether of cavalry. They were so much addicted to riding

                   The flesh of their favourite ani-mal, the horse, was numbered among their greatest delicacies; his blood mixed with milk was their most delicious beve-rage

Before their migration to the South they wore the lose stole of the East, which descended down to their heels; their arms consisted chiefly of the bow and the arrow

                  ; and their daughters, a singular mark of the ferocity of their manners, were debarred from marriage until they had slain an enemy in the field

                  . The character of the Celtae was, in some respects, in the other extreme. Though they were not unacquainted with the use of cavalry, their chief strength consisted in foot. They drew their subsistence from their flocks and herds, from the chace, and the produce of their lands. Their dress was fashioned to the shape of their bodies and limbs; and, in place of the bow

and arrow, they carried the buckler and spear to war. Polygamy was unknown among them; and though their wives and daughters accompanied them in their ex-peditions, women never engaged in bat-tle but in the worst extreme of fortuneVid.

                  , the western Russia, and the regions between the Baltic and the extre-mities of the North. The Celtae pos-sessed the western Europe, Spain, Gaul, Italy, the British Isles, and a great part of Germany. These two great nations meeting one another on their frontiers, formed a third race of men, whose cha-racter, manners, and language, bore the strongest mark of their mixed origin. Such were the Peucini, the Venedi, and Fenni, of Tacitus, who, though classed among the old Germans, were tinctured with the loose manners and characteristical dirt and laziness of the Sarmatae

                  Progress of theSarmatae to the South. In the period of time between the days of Tacitus and the reign of Marcus Au-relius, the mixed breed of the Celto-Sarmatic Germans of the North be-came so numerous on the shores of the Baltic, that, under the name of Vandals and MarcomanniMarcomanni signifies borse-men in the Celtic lan-guage; a proof of their Sarmatic origin. they vanced into Pannonia, crossed the Da-nube, and ravaged the Roman territories

                  . The emperor opposed them in person, and after, in his second expedition, he died at Sirmium, the Barbarians were driven back by the valour and conduct of Pertinax, who commanded in Dacia and the two Maesias

                  . Recruited by new migrations from the Sarmatae beyond the Vistula and the Baltic, they attempted to break into the Roman dominions in the reign of Commodus, but with not success: Maxi-min and Dioclesian obtained signal victo-ries over them

                  ; and, in short, as long as the empire retained any vigour on its frontier, the legions found means to repel the depredatory armies of the northern Sarmatae.
               
                  

                  The ances-tors of the Barbarians who over-turned the empire. The enemies with whom the Romans contended in the decline of their empire were far from being the same race of men who opposed them when they first pene-trated with their arms beyond the Alps. The whole dominions of the Celtae, ex-cepting a part of Germany, the northern Britain, and Ireland, fell under the power of Rome during its political vigour. The Sarmatae of Scandinavia, with that fondness for migration which they exhi-bited in all ages, advanced gradually into Germany, and, being stopt in their pro-gress by the legions stationed on the Rhine and Danube, settled between the Baltic, the ocean, and the two great rivers just mentioned, and rose into various petty nations, whose manners bore evident marks of their mixed origin. The blood of the Sarmatae seems however to have most prevailed; for the language and character which the Barbarians who overturned the empire carried with them into the South of Europe were much more nearly allied to the Sarmatic Tar-tars of the East than to the Celtic nations who possessed the West. The writers therefore who affirm, that the present lan-guage of Germany is the remains of the old Celtic, deceive themselves and the public. The truth is, the modern Ger-mans are almost as little concerned in those barbarous tribes, whom Tacitus so

elegantly describes, as the Turks of Pe-loponnesus are in the history and manners of the ancient Spartans.

                  Goths and Vandals. The Goths and Vandals, who made such a great figure in Europe, originally possessed a part of that immense tract of country which lies between the Baltic and the northern ocean

                  . In a period of remote antiquity they quitted their ancient seats in Scandinavia, and seized on the southern shore of the Baltic from the mouth of the Vistula to the Elb and the German ocean. The Vandals were the principals in this great migration, which must have happened a considerable time before their first appearance on the con-fines of the Roman dominions in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Their situation in Germany was to the West of the Goths; and they were subdivided into a variety of small communities

Notwithstanding the small hopes he entertains of reconciling the public judgment to the pe-riod which he has endeavoured to illustrate, he has taken some pains to present, in its most a-greeable form, a subject not very capable of ornament. He has studied to be clear in disquisition, concise in observation, just in in-ference. An enemy to fiction himself, he imposes none upon the world. He advances nothing as fact without authorities; and his conjectures arise not so much from his own ingenuity, as from the proofs which the ancients have laid down before him.

                  Origin of the Angli. The Angli, from whom the majority of the English nation derive their blood, and the whole their name, were one of the small states which the Romans comprehended under the general name of Vandals. Ta-citus has had the good fortune to have dignified his account of the Germans with the first mention of a nation who have since made such an illustrious figure in the world
                     Aviones et ANGLI, et Varini, fiuminibus et sylvis muniuntur. Tacit. Germ. xl.
                     
                  . They, however, promised but little of their future greatness in the days of the elegant writer. He passes slightly over them in a catalogue of obscure tribes, who were remarkable for nothing but the peculiar worship they paid to Hertha, or the earth, well known to be the great goddess of the Scandinavian Sarmatae, who were the ancestors of the Angli. They seem to have been in possession of that part of the shore of the Baltic which extends from the Vekel to the Drave. The Elb bounded their territories to the South; the tribe of Vandals, distinguished by the name of Varini, bordered with them on the East, and their friends and allies the Saxons lay between them and the German ocean.
               
                  

                  Of the Sax-ons. The Saxons derived their origin from the same source with the Angli. The perfect identity in point of customs, man-ners, and religion, which subsisted be-tween these two tribes, their unanimity in expedition and war, the facility with which they were lost in one another in their British conquests, prove, beyond dis-pute, that the names of Angli and Saxons were but two appellations for one and the same people. The western Vandals are, for the first time, mentioned under the name of Saxons by Ptolemy

                  . The

situation of the Angli on the shore of the Baltic, that of the Saxons on the Ger-man ocean, and the knowledge of naval affairs which both derived from the Suiones, who were their ancestors in Scan-dinavia, rendered them a troublesome enemy to the empire

                  . During that period they gradually possessed themselves of the whole shore of the German ocean from the Elb to the Rhine; and after the Franks had forced their way into Gaul, the Saxons succeeded them in their ancient seats in Germany, and formed an ample dominion in that country, before they found means to establish themselves in a better soil and climate.
               
                  Their his-tory on the continent little known The history of the Saxons before their arrival in Britain is comprehended in the transient notice taken of their piracies by the writers of Rome. Like the other nations whose expeditions proved fatal to the power of the Romans they advanced in a cloud of darkness into the regions of the South. Ignorant of letters, they had not the means of transmitting any account of themselves to after ages, and those who could record their actions were the

natural enemies of their fame. Neither is the loss which their posterity have suf-fered from this circumstance either consi-derable or to be much regretted. The Barbarians of the northern Europe car-ried scarce any virtue, except valour, into the conquered provinces. Their object was to get settlements for themselves, and not to procure subjects; and to obtain the former, they exercised every species of in-humanity against the latter. Time, however, has, in its progress, worn off their ferocity; and the nations of modern Europe have been rendered independent of the absence of history among their ances-tors by their own proper fame.
            
         
         
            

            RELIGION AND GOVERNMENT OF THE ANGLO-SAXONS.
            
               Their Religion.
               
                  General observations. MEN not favoured with revelation give their own passions and preju-dices to the divinities whom they adore. Brought up in battle, and habituated to blood, the northern nations made their Gods as fierce and untractable as them-selves. The character which they give of Odin differs, in no respect, from the pic-tures we have of those bold and intrepid warriors who led them into the regions of the South. His hall was not better fur-nished than the rude mansion of a Saxon chief, nor was his table provided with any other fare than the fat of an inexhau-stible wild boar
                     Sufficere illis queat lardum apri, qui Scrimner vo-catur. Is quotidie elixatur, sed vespere integer rema-net. Edda Island. Mythol. xxxiii.
                     
                  , which, though regu-larly boiled every morning for dinner, re-mained at night entire. Ale, the favour-ite

beverage of the North, went round in the skulls of the enemies of his follow-ers and friends

                  ; and arms, which were the delight of the Saxon in this life, con-tinued to be his amusement in another world
                     Recreatio autem mono heroum quotidiana haec est . . . mutuis sternentur caedibus. Hic illorum ludus. Instanti vero prandii tempori omnes incolumes in au-lam equitant et potandum confident. Edda Island. Mythol. xxxv.
                     
                  . Battle was the daily pastime, and slaughter itself the recreation, of the blessed. The deaths which were the con-sequences of these conflicts, were, how-ever, temporary; for the slain, upon the approach of the time of dinner, started up as if nothing had happened, rodeThe Sarmatae, it seems, carried their favourite ani-mal, the horse, into their paradise. into the Valhalla, and sat down to serious drinking.
               
                  Their mode of worship. The mode of worship among the Sax-ons was as simple as their ideas of the di-vinity were unrefined. A great log of unfashioned wood perpendicularly raised in the open air was the common repre-sentative of Odin. This idol they distin-guished by the name of IRMINSUL, a word which, in their language, signified the universal pillar which sustains the

world
                     Truncum ligni non parvae magnitudinis, in altum erectum sub dio colabant, patria eorum linguâ, IRMIN-SUL appellantes quod Latinè dicatur universalis colum-na quasi sustinens omnia. Adam Berm. 
                     
                  . There is a kind of philosophy in this meaning which agreed but little with the general character of the sangui-nary God. The Sarmatae, who worship-ped him under the figure of a sword, formed more suitable ideas of a Power who delighted in human blood
                     Mors omnium Scytharum deus; ei pro simulacris enses. Pomp. Mela,  
                     
                  .
               
                  Their three divinities, Some writers, who have unnecessarily raked up the antiquities of the North for arguments in favour of our present reli-gion, have hugged themselves in the thoughts of having found a Trinity in the mythology of the old Scandinavians. Odin, Thor, and Frea
                     Suecis trium deorum erectae imagines habebantur, Thor, Odin, et Frea. Ericus Olaus,  i.
                     
                   are said to have been the only powers dignified with places of worship and statues, though a number of inferior intelligences were respected and venerated. But Thor is only the title of Thunderer, annexed, by all na-tions, to the Supreme Divinity
                     Unum Deum fulguris effectorum solum agnoscunt. Procop. Goth. ib. i.
                     
                  . Odin was worshipped under that name as pre-siding over the regions of the air, as the ruler of tempests, the director of thunder, the lord of the weather, and protector 

and nourisher of the fruits of the earth
                     Thor praesidet in aëre, tonitrus et fulmina, vent
                           •

                  .
               
                  Frea, Odin wife. The Saxons and their Scandinavian an-cestors having given human passions to Odin, accommodated him also with a wife
                     Paul. Diacon.  Longob.  i.
                  . Contrary to the practice of the Celtae, they admitted a female divinity into the catalogue of their Gods; which furnishes another argument of their Sar-matic origin. The Angli, in the days of Tacitus, worshipped the Earth under the name of Hertha; and it was the same divinity who afterwards obtained the title of Frea, the spouse of the great Odin. Men who deduce every system of religion from rational principles, may rest the origin of that of the Saxons on philo-sophy. Odin was the irresistible princi-ple which gives motion to every thing that breathes; and Hertha, Frea, or the Earth, furnished that portion of matter which is animated into living creatures, by the active and pervading spirit, which is distinguished under the name of God.
               
                  Worship of Frea, under the name of Hertha, or the Earth. Tacitus, with his usual precision and elegance, describes the veneration which the Angli and their neighbours on the Baltic paid to the spouse of Odin. Her worship filled the minds of her devotees

with sentiments very opposite to those which the bloody altars of Odin inspired. During the feast which was held in ho-nour of Hertha, an universal joy spread over the country. Benevolence and hos-pitality prevailed in every quarter; war and discord ceased; and it was then only that peace and quiet were either known or loved. The universal parent of man-kind did not, they thought, delight in the destruction of her race; and therefore every instrument of death was shut up during her supposed residence in the land. When she retired to her sacred grove, her warlike worshippers, whose bent to humanity was only temporary, recoiled with violence into the favourite occupa of slaughter and war
                     In commune Hertham, est, terram matrem, colunt. Est in insula oceani castum nemus, dicatum in eo vehiculum veste contectum. Sacerdos adesse am penetrali intelligit vectamque bobus feminis multa cum veneratione prosequitur. Laeti tunc dies, festa loca quaecunque adventu hospitioque dignatur. Non bella ineunt, non arma sumunt clausum omne ferrum: pax et quies tunc tantum nota, tunc tantum amata, donec sacerdos Deam templo reddat. Tacit. Germ. lx.
                     
                  .
               
                  Human sa-crifices. Though no apology can wash away the stain which the blood of human victims has left on the hands of our ancestors, there are circumstances which may lessen the horror which naturally arises in the mind against a practice so opposite to every idea of humanity. An uninterrupted ac-quaintance

with danger created, among the northern nations, a contempt for death, which, in the firm belief of an immediate entrance into a life of joy and festivity in Odin hall, they looked upon as a blessing ra-ther than a misfortune. A demise through violence, in battle, through suicide, or by the hands of the priest, procured an imme-diate admission into the northern paradise. It was only the unfortunate persons who died of disease or age that were precipi-tated into the dark dominions of Hela.

                   Self-preservation, that first principle of the human mind, seems to have vanished be-fore the strength of this extraordinary prejudice. When danger rose to its height it became a source of elevation and joy, as it brought within view a certainty of perpetual felicity in another world
                     In acie exultabant, tanquam gloriose et feliciter vita excessuri. Lamentabantur in morbo quasi turpiter et miserabiliter perituri. Valer. Max.

The Valhalla, or hall of Odin, was placed on the top of the high mountains of Sevo; the Celtic nations surrounded their Fortu-nate Island with tempest in the Atlantic ocean. Among the Sarmatae, only those

                  General SHOULD a traveller of ordinary curiosity land at the mouth of the Nile, he might perhaps content himself with viewing the fine effect, which that noble river has on the appearance of the lower Egypt: One more inquisitive might chuse to trace the stream to where it falls from the desert into the plains of Thebes: But he, indeed, must be un-commonly curious, who would wander in search of its source to the Mountains of the MoonThe source of the Nile is said to lie in mountains of that name beyond the line.. The novelty of the ro-mantic

who fell by the sword were admitted to the table of Odin: Such as died of dis-ease or age went to the regions of Hela under the earth. Men slain in battle were, among the Celtae, entitled to a more elevated degree of happiness in their paradise; but the peaceable and unwar-like had also a beautiful Island of their own. Fighting, drinking, and the mini-stration of young virgins comprehended the joys of the Valhalla: the Celtic he-roes wandered after a variety of rural pleasures over the face of a beautiful and extensive country. The heroes of the former were always in the presence of Odin: There is no mention made of the Divinity in the Celtic ParadiseThe Druids, considering the Divinity as the per-vading spirit which gave life and motion to the whole body of nature, formed no ideas of him as a personal existence.. The Sarmatae remained for ever in the Val-halla; the souls of the departed retain  among the Celtae, a warm affection for their country and living friends, often returned to visit them. The Sarmatae admitted a good and a bad principle in their mythology; they had their Hell as well as their Heaven: the Celtae placed nothing but endless felicity beyond the li-mits of the present life.
            
            
               

               Their Government.
               
                  General ob-servations. The want of information, which in-duced the writers of Rome to remove the northern limits of ancient Germany to the pole, was a source of error to the learned of modern times. The latter have ex-tended the general character of the Cel-tic nations between the Rhine and the Elb, to the inhabitants of Scandinavia and the shores of the Baltic. In vain have the wild nations of the north advan-ced into the southern Europe with posi-tive proofs of their own Sarmatic origin; men of letters have chosen to make them Celtae; and Celtae, in spite of all evi-dence to the contrary, they must remain. To differ from the learned in this point is neither precipitate nor presumptuous. The ancients give no countenance to their opinion, and the unmixed posterity of those nations, who overwhelmed the empire of the West, argue against them with all the force of language, manners, and government. To the origin of the latter we shall, at present, confine our in-quiries.
               
                  Monarchs absolute a-mong the Scandinavi-ans; The Scandinavians, in the days of Ta-citus, were subject to absolute monarchy.

They were a commercial people

                  ; esta-blished property had attached them to fixed abodes. Wealth was honoured among them, and they acquiesced under the un-limited despotism of one
                     Est apud illos et opibus honos; eoque unus impe-ritat, nullis exceptionibus, non precario jure parendi. Tacit. Germ. xliv.
                     
                  . Secured by their situation from foreign enemies, their domestic spirit declined

                  . They suffered themselves to be disarmed by their prin-ces; and thus the tyranny of Asia, in the absence of its luxury, prevailed under the pole. The Sitones of Norway were even more abject than their brethren to the East of the mountains of Sevo. They not only degenerated from liberty but even from slavery itself: they submitted to the government of women, and added disgrace to servitude
                     Foemina dominatur: non modo à libertate, sed etiam à servitute degenerant. Tacit. Germ. lxv.
                     
                  . This attachment to hereditary succession continued among the colonies which Scandinavia established to the South of the Baltic. The Rugii, the Lemovii

                  , all the Vandals from the Isle of Rugen to the German ocean, as well as their brethren the Sarmatic Go-thones

on the Vistula, were distinguished by their obedience to kings

                  very limited among the ancestors of the Saxons, It is however certain, that the monarchs of the Scandinavian Sarmatae lost their in-fluence in the progressive migrations of their subjects towards the South. The Goths and Vandals, the undoubted ances-tors of the modern English, were remark-able for their attachment to civil liberty. Though the crown was hereditary in cer-tain families

                  . With war the reverence for his person was at an end. Indignity was added to his want of consequence and

power; the meanest of his subjects sat with him at table, joined in his conver-sation, used him with contempt, and dis-graced him with scurrility

                  . The rabble being, by the strength of esta-blished custom, admitted to the entertain-ments of the prince, the unhappy man, instead of being treated with the reve-rence due to his rank, was often obliged to purchase with presents a decency of be-haviour from his barbarous guests

They sometimes persecuted him to death itself, for no other cause but that they were determined to submit to the com-mands

                  . To sup-port the expence of entertaining these constant attendants of his presence he re-ceived from the people a voluntary and free gift of cattle and corn
                     Mos est civitatibus ultro ac viritim conferre princi-pibus, vel armentorum, vel frugum aliquid; quod pro honore acceptum etiam necessitatibus subvenit. Tacit. Germ. 
                     
                  , and he also derived a kind of revenue from the fines imposed upon petty offenders
                     Pars mulctae regi exsolvitur. Tacit. Germ. xii.

prince and his assessors formed the lesser assembly; and differences between indi-viduals were heard and determined before them.
               
                  Their legal punish-ments. Traitors against the state, and deserters to an enemy, were tried among the old Germans before the general assembly of the people, and, upon conviction, hang                      Proditores et transfugas arboribus suspendunt. Tacit. Germ. xii.
                     
                  . Cowards and men of infamous lives were drowned under hurls in stag-nant and muddy pools
                     Ignavos et imbelles et corpore infames, coeno et palude, injecta insuper crate, mergunt. Tacit. Germ. xii.
                     
                  . The laws of the ancient Saxons on the continent were particularly severe against incontinency and adultery. Should a virgin in her fa-ther house, or a married woman in that of her husband, be guilty of incontinence, she was either strangled by her relations in private, and her body burnt, or she was delivered over to a species of public punishment the most ignominous and cruel. Cut short of her clothing by the waist, she was whipped from village to village by ancient matrons, who, at the same time, pricked her body with knives till she expired under their hands
                     In antiqua Saxonia, si virgo in paternâ domo, vel maritata sub conjuge sit adulterata; manum propriâ strangulatam cremant; aut cingulo tenus vestibus abs-cissis, flagellant eam castae matronae, et villa in villam missae occurrunt novae flagellantes, et cultellis pungunt, donec interimant. Bonifacius Episcopus, in epistolâ Ethelbaldum, Anglorum regem.
                     
                  . Vir-tue,

in this case, degenerated into un-pardonable barbarity.—They animad-verted upon petty offenders with slighter punishments. A fine in cattle, propor-tioned to the degree of the offence, was levied by authority of the king and his as-sessors upon the delinquent; even homi-cide itself was expiated by a certain 
                     •…
                  ulct payable to the prince and the relations of the person slain
                     Luitur enim etiam homicidium certo armentorum et pecorum numero, receptique satisfactionem universadomus. Tacit. Germ. xii.
                     
                  . Such were the rude elements which time has improved into the present constitution of English govern-ment.
               
                  Concluding reflection. To enter into the character and man-ners of the Saxons, in this place, would pre-occupy a province which we have re-served for another occasion. Before their arrival in Britain we have only transient and interrupted glimpses of their history through the obscurity in which their pro-gress towards the South was involved. Their chief virtue was a ferocious bravery; their sole occupation was war. They certainly performed great actions, but they themselves were unacquainted with the means of transmitting them to posteri-ty; and their fame being left in the hands of their enemies, came down through time mutilated and incomplete.

                  observa-tions. A writer who penetrates into antiquity to investigate the springs from which a nation has issued, may, in like manner, have his amusement for his labour Par-tial to themselves, the bulk of the people regard only those periods of their history which descend nearest to their own times. Satisfied with the renown of latter trans-actions, they are as indifferent concerning their remote annals and origin as they who profit by the inundations of the Nile are about the distant fountain from which it takes its rise. The traveller, to con-tinue the comparison, has, in some re-spects, the advantage of the writer; for the sandy deserts of Africa present not a more uncomfortable prospect to the eye than the sterile regions of national antiqui-ties. This consideration, though it shall not prevent, will contribute to shorten the present inquiry.

new communities rose gradually before them as they advanced into the heart of the island; till the whole body of its in-habitants came forward distinctly to view, when Agricola carried the Roman eagles to the mountains of Caledonia. But to investi-gate the origin of our ancestors with pre-cision we must return to a period of more remote antiquity.
               
                  Affected by revolutions on the con-tinent. The British Isles, from their vicinity to the continent, must, in the nature of things, have been affected by the revolu-tions which we have in the preceding sections briefly described. The circles, spreading from commotions in the center, must have vibrated, though perhaps faintly, in the extremities of Europe; and the shock was certainly felt beyond the limits to which conquest and migra actually extended themselves. We can accordingly trace, in lively charac-ters, in Britain, the effect of every great movement made on the continent by the body of the Celtae before the power of the Romans confined them to fixed abodes.

               The Gaël.
               
                  A conjec-ture con-cerning the aera Whether Britain was inhabited, or rather perambulated, by a race of Barbarians before the Gaël of the continent extended their name with their arms into all the regions of Europe
                     Ferox natio Gallorum pervagata bello prope orbem terrarum. Livius,  xxxviii.
                     
                  , is a circumstance which lies buried in impenetrable dark-ness. The name of Gaël, still retained by the posterity of the most ancient in-habitants of the British Isles, seems to look for its origin to the first great revo-lution of the Celtae on the continent. The wild tribes who originally possessed the vast regions bounded by the ocean, the Mediterranean, the Rhine, the Alps, and the Pyrenean mountains, were, as has been already observed, the first of the Euro-pean Scythians, if we except the Pelasgi of Greece, who formed themselves into distinct communities. Arriving at some degree of civilization, they became over-stocked with numbers at home, and they sent armies of emigrants in quest of foreign settlements

attract the early attention of the Gaël. Its vicinity to their original

                  of their migration. It were idle to hope to ascertain the aera in which the first migration of the Gauls into Britain ought to be placed. Its antiquity has left only room for con-jecture. We should, in all probability, look for it beyond the establishment of the Phoceans in the district of Massilia. Though it is affirmed, both by Livy and Plutarch
                     Titus Livius,  
                  , that the Gauls for the first time, entered Italy in a hostile manner in the reign of the elder Tarquin, we have reason to believe, that partial emigrations from that nation crossed the Alps many ages before the foundation of Rome itself was laid

                     The epithet of VETERES, applied to the Gauls, is perhaps intended to distinguish the progenitors of the Umbri, the old Gaël, from the Cimbro-Germanic Gauls, who, in an after age, pervaded all the regions of Europe.
                  . We may naturally suppose that the Gauls of Belgium would have found less difficulty in crossing a very nar-row channel into Britain than their coun-trymen at the foot of the Alps in clam-bering, with their wives and children, over the vast ridge of mountains which separated them from Italy. It may there-fore be concluded, that Britain received very considerable colonies from the Belgic division of Gaul as early, at least, as the Gaël of the Alpin regions seized upon Italy under the name of UmbriThe Umbri were the inhabitants of the upper Italy, and they seem to derive their name from the situa of their country. Oambruich literally signifies the declivity of a ridge of mountains.. But though it is impossible to fix with preci-sion on the aera of the invasion of Britain by the Gaël, no doubt can remain con-cerning the existence of the fact itself.

The Gaël of Britain and Ireland retain a proof of their origin in their indigenous name. The writers of antiquity confirm it from every quarter

               The Cimbri.
               
                  The Cim-bri. The Gaël were in possession of Bri-tain for many ages before they were disturbed by a second migration from the continent. The spirit of conquest passing from the Gauls to the Celto-Germanic colonies beyond the Rhine, the latter pervaded Europe with their armies
                     Cimbri magnam Europae nec exiguam Asiae par-tem

                  . We must judge of the aera in which this revolution happened from its effect on those nations who had the means of transmitting their own history, as well as some account of their enemies, to after ages.

                  . A-bout half a century after the death of Alexander, they poured irresistible armies into Greece, Thrace, and Macedonia; the latter of which, though recent from

the conquest of Asia, they subdued and ruined

                   between their original seats and the Hellespont; and some of them, passing the Propontis, filled the lesser Asia with their colonies

                  their migra  The irruption of the Cimbri was not merely depredatory. They left colonies in the conquered countries
                     Agros debellatorum a se occuparunt. Diod. Sic.  
                     
                  , and the manners which their successors, in the same regions, brought down to after-times, was a kind of proof that they exterminated those nations whom they subdued.—Whilst a part of the Cimbri, or Celto-Germans, pushed their con-quests to the South and East, others di-rected their migration to the regions of the West. We sind traces of them as

seems not to deserve. But the disquisitions of many learned men had given a kind of consequence to the subject, when they rendered it perplexed and obscure. To extricate truth from the polemical rubbish of former antiquaries was a task of labour; and the candid will forgive the length, on account of the pro-priety, of the disquisition, espe-cially in a work which pro-fessedly treats of the antiquities of the British nations.
            In that part of his work which relates to the disputes between the British and Irish Scots, the Author of the Introduction rives much of his information from the manuscript notes of the late very ingenious Dr. Macpher-son, whose dissertations on the antiquities of the northern Bri-tain are in the hands of the learn  In the other provinces of

far as the extremities of Europe
                     Omnium Cimbrorum fortissimi sunt Lusitani. Diod. Sic.  
                     
                  ; they were, in some measure, the ancestors of the Lusitanians, and they rose into a mixed nation with the Aborigines of the mountains of Gallicia. In Britain, their very name remains, with their blood, in the Cimbri of Wales.
               
                  into Britain. When some of the Cimbri appeared on the frontiers of Greece, others drove the ancient Gaël from the Belgic division of Gaul. Caesar observes, that the Belgae were the posterity of German emigrants who settled in ancient times to the South of the Rhine, on account of the ferti-lity of the soil
                     Reperiebat Caesar Belgas esse ortos ab Germanis Rhenum antiquitus transductos, propter loci fertilita-tem ibi concedisse; Gallosque qui ea loca incolerent, expulisse. Caesar,  
                     
                  . Descrying, from their new settlements, the Island of Britain, they passed the narrow channel which di-vides it from the continent, and the Gaël, who had diffused themselves over all the Island, contracted their limits to-wards the South to give room to those new interlopers.
               
                  Etymon of Belgae. The Cimbri who remained in Gaul became afterwards to be distinguished by the name of Belgae. As that appella carries reproach in its meaning, it is likely that it was imposed on that

warlike nation by the Gaël whom they had expelled from their Territories. BALGE or BALGEN, in the ancient Cel-tic signifies a spotted or party-coloured herd; and, in a metaphorical sense, a mixed people, or an aggregate of many tribes. The name alludes either to Bel-gium being peopled promiscuously by the German tribes, or to the unavoidable mixture of the Celtic colonies beyond the Rhine with the Sarmatae of the East and North.
            
            
               

               The Belgae.
               
                  The Belgae. When the Romans carried their arms into Britain, the whole Island was pos-sessed by three nations sprung originally, thought at very different periods, from the Gaël of the continent. Two of these we have already described; the third falls now under consideration.—The Celto-Germanic tribes, who had driven the old Gaël from Belgium, settling in that di-vision of Gaul, rose, in process of time, into a variety of petty states. Each of these, some time before the arrival of Caesar, sent colonies into Britain
                     Maritima pars ab iis qui ex Belgis transierant. Caesar,  
                     
                  ; which, according to the testimony of the illustrious writer, retained the names of the small communities on the continent from which they respectively derived their origin
                     Omnes fere (Belgae in Britannia) iis nominibus ci-vitatum appellantur, quibus orti ex civitatibus eo per-venerunt. Caesar,  
                     
                  . The Cimbri, who had passed into Britain about three centuries prior to our aera, retiring from the pressure of these new invaders, possessed the country to the West of the Severn, and that which extended from the Humber to the Twe
                     •
                   The Gaël, under the general name of Caledonians, inhabited the rest of

the Island to the extremity of the North.
               
                  The aera of their arrival in Britain. It is difficult to ascertain the aera of this third migration from the continent. We ought to place it perhaps half a century prior to the arrival of Caesar. Divitia-cus, king of the Suessiones, who flou-rished before that great commander, may probably have transplanted from Gaul those tribes in Britain over whom he reigned.—The Belgae, when they trans-migrated into Britain, brought with them those arts of civil life which had made a considerable progress in Gaul before they left that country. The inhabitants of the maritime regions opposite to Gaul had almost attained to an equal pitch of cultivation with their brethren on the continent
                     Ex his omnibus longe humanissime sunt qui Can-tium incolunt; quae regio est maritima omnis: neque multum a Gallica differunt consuetudine. Caesar,  
                     
                  . They sowed corn, they had fixed abodes, and some degree of commerce was carried on in their ports.
               
                  The Bri-gantes This superior civilization rendered them objects of depredation to the Cimbri who had retired to the North and West from the pressure of the Belgae. The Cimbri, it is probable, had remained in the same rude barbarity which their ancestors brought with them from Belgium. Re-cent injuries joined issue with their love

of depredation. They made frequent in-cursions into the Belgic dominions; and it was from that circumstance that the Cimbri beyond the Humber derived their name of Brigantes, which signifies a race of freebooters and plunderers

                  and Silures were Cim-bri. The Silures on the western banks of the Severn were the most considerable tribe of the British Cimbri. They va-ried so much from the Belgae, that Ta-citus justly concluded that they were, in some measure, a different race of men. To deduce them from Spain was certainly an error. It is not in any degree proba-ble that, in so early a period, the Spa-niards, who were never a sea-faring people, could transport themselves over an immense ocean into Britain: Besides, the posterity of the Silures have come down to the present times; and, in their indigenous name of Cimbri, vindicate their originSIOL a race of men, URUS the river emphati-cally, in allusion to their situation beyond the Severn..
            
            
               

               Observations on the Three British Nations.
               
                  The Gaël, Cimbri, and Belgae, The three great British nations, whose origin we have endeavoured to investi-gate, must have differed considerably from one another in language, manners, and character. Though descended from the same source, their separation into different channels was very remote. The Gaël who possessed the northern Britain, by the name of Caledonians, having pas-sed from the continent before the arts of civil life had made any considerable progress among them, retained the pure but unimproved language of their an-cestors, together with their rude simplicity of manners.
               
                  though scended from the Celtic stock, The British Cimbri derived their ori-gin from the Galic colonies, who, in remote antiquity, had settled beyond the Rhine. These, with a small mixture of the Sarmatae, returned, in all their ori-ginal barbarism, into the regions of the South. During their separation from their mother nation, their language and manners must have suffered such a consi-derable change, that it is extremely doubtful whether their dialect of the Celtic and that of the old British Gaël were, at the arrival of the former in this Island, reciprocally understood by

both nations.—The third colony differed in every thing from the Gaël and Cimbri. Their manners were more humanized; and their tongue, though perhaps corrupted, was more copious. They had left the continent at a period of advanced civility. Their character changed with the progress of the arts of civil life; and new inventions had intro-duced new words and new expressions into their language.
               
                  spoke three different dialects. But though the three nations who pos-sessed the British Isles at the arrival of the Romans spoke three distinct dialects, and differed materially from one another in the formation of their phrases, and construction of their sentences, the radi-cal words used by all were certainly the same.

                  Observa-tions. To descend into a minute detail of the various petty tribes into which the three British nations were subdivided, would neither furnish instruction nor amusement. The Cimbri and Belgae, falling under the power of the Romans soon after they were mentioned by histo-rians, were lost in the general name of Britons; and the internal state of the Gaël of North Britain and Ireland, is covered with that impenetrable cloud which invariably involves illiterate na-tions who lie beyond the information of foreign writers.
            
            
               

               Ancient Names of Britain.
               
                  Observa-tions. Having briefly investigated the origin of the people, it may not be improper to inquire into the name of the country. Etymology is a science frequently full of deception, and always unentertaining and dry. But as the Author of the In-troduction returns back into antiquity with some advantages which men of greater abilities have not possessed, he hopes to be, in some measure, satisfactory on this subject.
               
                  The etymon of Albion. Alba or Albin, the name of which the ancient Scots, in their native lan-guage, have, from all antiquity, distin-guished their own division of Britain, seems to be the fountain from which the Greeks deduced their Albion. It was natural for the Gaël, who transmigrated from the low plains of Belgium, to call the more elevated land of Britain by a name expressive of the face of the coun-tay. ALB or ALP, in the Celtic, sig-nifies High, and IN invariably, a coun-try.—The name of Albion being im-posed upon the Island by the Gaël, the first colony was known before the appel-lation which the Romans latinized into Britannia.
               
                  

                  and of The Cimbri, the second Celtic colony who passed into Britain, arriving in Bel-gium, and descrying Albion, gave it a new name expressive of the same idea which first suggested the appellation of Albion to the Gaël. Comparing the elevated coast of Britain to the fenny plains of the lower Germany, they cal-led it BRAIT AN, a word compounded of BRAIT high, and AN or IN a country
                     Bretagne peut aussi avoir tiré son nom sa grande étendue. Brayd ou Brait signifie vaste, le plus grand. An Isle Bretan, plus grande Isle. Memoires sur Langue Celtique, tom. i.
                      But as it is extremely doubtful whether Britain was known to be an Island at the arrival of the Cimbri, we must take Brait in its original sense, signifying High; as in Braid-Albin, High-Albany, the most elevated district in North Britain..
               
                  Britain. This new name never extended itself to the Gaël of North Britain; and the posterity of the Cimbri have lost it in the progress of time. The Scottish and Irish Gaël have brought down the name of Alba or Albin to the present age; the Welsh use no appellation. The aera of its imposition ought to be fixed as far back as the arrival of the Cimbri in the Island. The Phoenicians of Gades and the Massilian Phoceans, who traded to the ports of Britain, learned the name of the natives, and communicated it to the writers of Greece and Rome.

            ANCIENT SCOTS.
            
               Preliminary Reflections.
               
                  Origin of the Caledo-nians unin-vestigated. IN proportion as we travel northward in ancient Britain, the darkness, which involves the antiquities of its in-habitants, thickens before us. The Cim-bri and Belgae, after they were compre-hended within the pale of the Roman dominions, were seen distinctly; but the more ancient inhabitants of the island, the Gaël, appeared only transiently, when, in an hostile manner, they advan-ced to the frontiers of the province. The arms of the empire penetrated, at differ-ent periods, into the heart of the coun-try beyond the Scottish friths; but as these expeditions were not attended with absolute conquest, and a consequent set-tlement of colonies, the Romans made little inquiry concerning the origin and history of the natives of the northern di-vision of Britain.
               
                  By the Ro-mans. Julius Agricola, who, for the first time, displayed the Roman eagles beyond the frith, was not more successful in the field than he was happy in an historian to transmit his actions with lustre to poste-rity. But even the distinct and intelli-gent

Tacitus gives but a very imperfect idea of those enemies, by the defeat of whom his father-in-law acquired so much reputation. We learn from him indeed, that the Caledonians were the most an-cient inhabitants of Britain, that they were brave and numerous, that, though overcome in the field by the discipline of the Roman Legions, they were far from being reduced into any subjection which could deserve the name of conquest.
               
                  Their his-tory After Agricola was removed from the government of Britain, the writers of the empire for some years lost sight of the Caledonians. The incursions of those barbarians into the province, forced both Adrian

                   could prevent them from

laying waste the northern division of the Roman Britain, till Severus, about the beginning of the third century, carried the war into their country with a nume-rous army. This is the sum of what the Romans have related concerning the Cale-donians for near two centuries after they were first mentioned: To their origin and internal history the writers of Rome were equally strangers.
               
                  peculiarly obscure. This defect in foreign writers, with regard to the ancient inhabitants of North Britain, is not supplied by any authen-tic monuments of their own. The Ca-ledonians were not more destitute of the means of preserving their history in the intermediate century between Agricola and Severus, than their posterity were for a considerable time after the Romans had relinquished the dominion of Britain. The climate and soil of Caledonia were far from being favourable to internal civi-lization; and a ferocity of manners, a-rising from an uninterrupted series of hostilities, effectually prevented the in-troduction of the arts of civil life from abroad.
               
                  A reflec  But when the Scots look back with re-gret upon that want of letters which has involved in obscurity and fable the origin and history of their ancestors, they ought to consider that it was, perhaps, from this circumstance arose that national inde-pendence

which they transmitted to their posterity. Had the Romans established themselves in Caledonia, we might in-deed have known more of the ancient inhabitants of that country; but it is much to be doubted whether the Scots of this age would have been more con-cerned in their history, than the English of Middlesex and Essex are in the tran-sactions of the Trinobantes, who posses-sed those counties in the time of Julius Caesar. The Romans, it is true, intro-duced the arts of civil life into the coun-tries which they subdued; but with those arts came in slavery, and a consequent imbecillity of mind, which, in the end, abandoned the vassals, as well as their lords, to conquest, and even to extirpa 
               
                  Scots desti-tute of an-cientdomes-tic writers. The first domestic writers of the history of North Britain were too ignorant, as well as too modern, to form any proba-ble system concerning the origin of their nation. Destitute of records at home, they found themselves obliged to fill up the void in their antiquities with tales which had been growing in Ireland, for some ages before, in the hands of a suc-cession of ignorant Bards and Fileas. After the study of critical learning was prosecuted with success among other na-tions, what part of it extended to Scot-land was only employed to remove some

of the absurdities of the old fables, and not levelled in a manly manner against the whole of that fabric of fiction which had so long dishonoured the antiquities of that country.
               
                  Inaccuracy and indo-lence of their mo-dern histo-rians. The ingenious father Innes was the first of the Scots who had the courage to attack the puerile system of their origin, which his countrymen had for many ages adopted. He wrested the sceptre of Scot-land from the first Fergus, and thirty-nine of the ideal successors of that pretended monarch, and passing over into Ireland discomfited that motley army of Bards, Fileas, and Senachies, which had been so long fortifying itself in rhimes, tra-ditions, and fabulous records. But Innes was more successful in destroying the in-digested accounts of others, than in esta-blishing a more rational system of his own. Setting out upon wrong princi-ples, and being an utter stranger to the Galic language, he fell into unavoidable mistakes; and endeavoured to obtrude upon the world opinions, concerning the origin of the Scots, no less improbable than those tales which he had exploded with so much success. Though Scotland has of late years produced men distin-guished for their talent in historical dis-quisition, none of them has thought pro-per to search for the genuine origin and history of his ancestors among those

fables which obscure the antiquities of the nation. Possessed of parts, perhaps, too valuable to be employed in investigations of that kind, they hastened to important periods of history where their abilities might with lustre be displayed.
               A learned ClergymanDr. John Macpherson, Minister of Slate in the Isle of Sky., in one of the Scottish isles, reduced lately into form and precision the antiquities which Innes had left in confusion and disorder. Had the ingenious writer extended his remarks as far as he might have been enabled to do by his erudition and great knowledge of all the branches of the Celtic language, there would, perhaps, be very little occa-sion for this Essay. His observations are so judicious, and his arguments so conclu-sive, on several points of this subject, that to give him the merit of being the best antiquary that has treated of the origin of the Scots, is too small a tribute to his memory.
            
            
               

               Origin of the Scots.
               
                  General re-flections on the origin of the Scots. It is unnecessary to controvert the opinion of Cornelius Tacitus concerning the origin of the ancient inhabitants of North Britain
                     Rutilae Caledoniam habitantium comae, magni artus, Germanicam originem asseverant. Tacit. Vit. Agric. cap. xi.
                     
                  . The name by which the celebrated writer himself distinguishes their country, is sufficient to demonstrate that they came from a very different quarter of the continent than what he supposed. When the arms of the empire under Julius Agricola laid open all the nations of Britain to the enquiry of the Romans, it has been already observed that the whole island was possessed by three nations, whom Tacitus endeavours to deduce from communities on the con-tinent very distant from one another. The posterity of two of those nations preserve, to this day, in their names, proofs that altogether subvert this opinion. The Silures or Cumri of the south, it has already appeared, had a much better title to a Germanic extraction than the Gael of Caledonia.
               
                  A colony of Gauls The Gaël, or ancient Gauls, having transmigrated from the continent at a period when the arts of civil life had

made but very little progress among them, must have maintained them-selves chiefly by hunting; and we may suppose, that in pursuit of their game they soon extended themselves to the northern extremity of the island. A people whose subsistence arises chiefly from the chace are never numerous; it is consequently natural to believe that the Cimbri met with little opposition from the Gaël, when the former passed from the continent and seized upon the south-ern division of Britain.
               
                  gradually advance in-to North Britain, and transmi-grate into Ireland. In proportion as the Cimbri advanced towards the north, the Gaël, being cir-cumscribed within narrower limits, were forced to transmigrate into the islands which crowd the northern and western coasts of Scotland. It is in this period, perhaps, we ought to place the first great migration of the British Gaël into Ire-land; that kingdom being much nearer to the promontory of Galloway and Cantyre, than many of the Scottish isles are to the continent of North Britain. This vicinity of Ireland had probably drawn partial emigrations from Caledonia before the arrival of the Cimbri in Bri-tain; but when these interlopers pressed upon the Gaël from the south, it is rea-sonable to conclude the numerous colo-nies passed over into an island so near,

and so much superior to their original country in climate and fertility.
               
                  Forced northward by the Belgae. The inhabitants of the maritime re-gions of Gaul crossing, in an after age, the British Channel
                     
                        Maritima pars (Britanniae) ab iis, qui praedae ac belli inferendi causa, ex Belgis transierant: . . . . . et bello illato ibi remanserunt, atque agros colere coepe-runt. Caesar Bell. Gall.  
                     
                  , established them-selves on that part of our island which lies nearest to the continent; and, mov gradually towards the north, drove the Cimbri beyond the Severn and Hum-ber. The Gaël of the north, reduced within limits still more circumscribed by the pressure of the Cimbri, sent fresh colonies into Ireland, while the Scottish friths became a natural and strong boun-dary towards the south to those Gaël who remained in Britain.
               
                  Formed in-to a nation. It was, perhaps, after the Belgic inva-sion of the southern Britain, that the Gaël of the northern division formed themselves into a regular community, to repel the incroachment of the Cimbri upon their territories. To the country which they themselves possessed they gave the name of CAEL-DOCH, which is the only appellation the Scots, who speak the Galic language, know for their own di-vision of Britain. CAEL-DOCH is a compound made up of GAEL or CAEL,

the first colony of the ancient Gauls who transmigrated into Britain, and DOCH, a district or division of a country. The Romans, by transposing the letter in CAEL, and by softening into a Latin termination the CH of DOCH, formed the well-known name of Caledonia. Obvious as this etymon of Caledonia appears, it was but very lately disco-veredThis etymon first occurred to the Author of this Essay, and he communicated it to Dr. Macpherson, who adopted it from a conviction of its justness.. Those who treated of the an-tiquities of North Britain, were utter strangers to that only name by which the Scots distinguished the corner of Britain which their ancestors possessed from the remotest antiquity. From an ignorance, so unpardonable in antiqua-ries, proceeded that erroneous system of the origin of the Scots, which, for many ages, has been, with so much confidence, obtruded on the world.
               
                  Internal history un-known. Concerning the internal state of Cale-donia, and the division of its inhabitants into various tribes in a very early period, we can find nothing certain. The ac-count given by Ptolemy of the Epidii, Carini, Cantae, Logae, and other na-tions, is little to be regarded. Tacitus passed over those petty communities in silence; and in the period between the

                  Their boun-daries. Though the Scottish friths are gene-rally allowed to have been the bounda-ries of Caledonia towards the South, it is more than probable that those tribes who possessed the country between the walls were principally descended from the ancient Gaël. The names of the Sel-govae and Gadeni, two petty communi-ties on the northern banks of the Solway and Tweed, seem to strengthen this sup-position. They carry in their significa a proof that the tribes who bore them were in a state of hostility with their neighbours the Ottadini and Brigan-tes, which furnishes a presumption, that they derived their origin from a different quarterSELGOVAE is plainly SELGOVICH latinized. SEL-GOVICH literally signifies bunters, in a metaphorical sense plunderers; a name by which their successors in the same country ought to have been distinguished till within little more than a century back. GADENI is plainly from Gadecbin, robbers; a name which arose from the same love of depredation with their friends and neighbours the Selgovae..
               
                  The Maea-tae. But as that tract of country which is comprehended between the Tweed and Solway, and the Scottish friths, was more

exposed to invasion than Caledonia, we may conclude that the Gaël who posses-sed it, were, in some degree, mixed with the Cimbric Ottadini and Brigantes, even before the invasions of the Romans pres-sed those tribes towards the North. It was from this unavoidable mixture that the Selgovae, Gadeni, Damnii, and No-vantes, were, in an after age, distin-guished by the name of Maeatae, which signifies a people descended from a double origin, as well as the inhabitants of a controverted countryMOI-ATTA, or MOI-ATICH, the inhabitants of the plains: MAEAN-ATTA, the possessors of the middle country: MOAI-ATTA, a mixed people.

                  Ireland first peopled from Bri-tain. THE origin of the ancient British nations being investigated, little difficulty can remain in tracing the old Irish to their genuine source. The cinity of Ireland to two promontories in the northern Britain, furnishes a strong presumption that the inhabitants of the former transmigrated, in an early period, from the latter

                  . Besides, there is not a fact concerning any nation, beyond the pale of the Roman empire, better esta-blished by the testimony of writers of unquestionable authority, than the British extraction of the old Irish.

They acknowledged, on the authority of the Hibernian Senachies, that British colonies, a short time after the universal deluge, transmigrated into Ireland from North-Britain. But these ill-fated Britons, like many other inter-lopers from various parts of the world, who succeeded them in Ireland, had the misfortune to fall under the displeasure of the Senachies, and were inhumanly ex-terminated,

to make room for the Mile-sian Scots, so famous in the fictions and rhimes of the Bards.
               
                  The British Gaël the ancestors of the Irish. It is little to the purpose to enquire whether the Scythian Nomades, who, prior to the migrations of the Gauls, wandered over the vast regions of Eu-rope, found their way into Ireland from the nearest promontories of Britain. The name of GAEL, still retained by the old Irish, sufficiently demonstrates, that they derive their blood from those Gaël or Gauls, who, in an after period, were distinguished in Britain by the name of Caledonians. The wildest en-thusiasts in Hibernian antiquities never once asserted that the Caledonians, or their posterity the Picts, were of Irish extract; yet nothing is better ascertained than that the ancient Britons of the South gave to the Scots, the Picts, and the Irish, the common name of GaëlMr. 'Connor, who lately gave to the public some wild, incoherent tales, concerning the ancient Irish, endeavours to obviate the strength of the argu-ment, which rises against his system from the name of GAEL, by disguising the word, by the insertion of the intermediate letters, Db, as thus, Gadbel. The sub-terfuge avails nothing. Db are universally quiescent, or at most sound like a Υ, in every dialect of the Cel-tic language.; and consequently that they very justly concluded that the three nations derived their origin from the same source, the ancient GAEL of the continent.
               
                  

                  Conjecture concerning the time of their trans-migration. The British Gaël, in an early age, extending themselves to the very extre-mities of the Island, descried Ireland from the Mulls of Galloway and Cantire, and crossing the narrow channel which sepa-rates the two countries, became the pro-genitors of the Irish nation. In propor as fresh emigrants from the conti-nent of Europe forced the ancient Gaël towards the North of Britain, more co-lonies transmigrated into Ireland from the promontories which we have so often mentioned. It is probable that it was after the arrival of the Cimbri in Bri-tain, a Number of the GAEL, sufficient to deserve the name of a nation, settled themselves in Ireland. But they became so numerous in that country before the arrival of the Belgae in Britain, that the colonies which transmigrated from that nation into Ireland were, together with their language, manners, and customs, lost in the Gaël; so that in one sense the Caledonians may be reckoned the sole progenitors of the old IrishThe Firbolg, so often mentioned in the traditions of the Irish, were Belgic colonies who transmigrated from Britain after the Belgae had seized on the southern division of England. They are mentioned very fre-quently under the name of Siol na Bolga in the poems of Offian..
               
                  

                  Etymon of the name of Erin; When the Gaël arrived first in Ireland they naturally gave it the name of IAR-INIAR-IN, or as the Irish pronounce the word, EIR-IN, is compounded of Iar, West; and In, Island. EIR-IN is the name which the natives, in all ages, gave to Ireland., or the western country, in contra-distinction to their original settlements in Britain. From IAR-IN is not only to be deduced the EIRIN of the Irish themselves, but those various names by which the Greeks and Romans distin-guished their IslandJuverna, Ierna, Iris, 
                        
                     , Hibernia.. The appellation of IAR-IN was not altogether confined to Ireland by the Gaël of North Britain. They gave it also to those numerous Islands which crowd the western coasts of Caledonia; but when by degrees they became acquainted with the vast extent of Ireland, when compared to the other Scottish Isles, they called it by an em-phasis IARIN or EIRIN, the western country or IslandThe proper and more ancient general appellation of the Scottish Isles is IAR-IN, and from that name, as shall hereafter appear, Claudian derived his Ierna. After the conquest of the Hebrides by Harold Harfager king of Norway, the whole string of islands which stretch along the western shores of North Britain, were called by the Scots on the continent, Inch-Gaul, or the Islands of Foreigners..
               
                  and of Hi-bernia. Hibernia, the most common name by which the Romans distinguished Ireland, may appear to some too remote in the

pronunciation and Orthography from IAR-IN, or EIRIN, to be derived from either. This difficulty is easily removed. Julius Caesar mentions, for the first time, Ireland under the name of Hibernia. One of two reasons induced the illustri-ous writer to use that appellation. He either latinized the HYVERDHON of the southern Britains, or, what is more probable, he annexed to Ireland a name which suited his own ideas of its air and climate. The Romans, long after the expedition of Caesar, entertained a very unfavourable opinion of the climate of Ireland: Strabo thought that the severity of the weather rendered that Island ex-tremely uncomfortable
                     Strabo,  
                  , and Pomponius Mela was told that corn never ripened there on account of the inclemency of the seasons
                     Supra, Britanniam Juverna est . . . . . . coeli maturanda semina iniqui. Pomp. Mela,  
                     
                  . The attention of Caesar was engaged by much more important objects than in informing himself minutely concerning the climate of a country to which he never intended to carry his arms. If Strabo and Mela, whose sub-ject led to enquiries of that kind, sup-posed that the air of Ireland was ex-tremely intemperate, it is no wonder that Caesar should have fallen into a similar

mistake; and we may from this circum-stance conclude that he formed the name of Hibernia from the adjective Hibernus. He thought that a perpetual winter reigned in Ireland; and he was informed that, in the lesser islands in the neighbourhood, one winter night was equal to thirty in Italy
                     Qua ex parte est Hibernia . . . . . . . complures praeterea minores objectae Insulae existimantur; qui-bus insulis nonnulli scripserunt dies continuous xxx sub bruma esse noctem. Caesar Bell. Gall.

                  Observati-ons. A deduction of the etymon of Hiber-nia from another fountain gave birth, per-haps, to a system concerning the origin of the Irish, diametrically opposite to that which we mean to establish. The world are well acquainted with the pretensions which the Irish have made, for many ages, to very high antiquities, as well as to an original very different from the other inhabitants of the British Isles. In-stead of transmigrating from the nearest continent, in the natural progress of migra  it seems that the first colonies came to Ireland, across an immense ocean, at a period when the rude navigation of the other nations of Europe scarcely en-abled them to waft themselves over rivers and narrow arms of the sea.
               
                  Pretensions of the old Irish to let-ters. To support this improbable tale, ano-ther was formed no less incredible in itself than the fact it was meant to ascertain. The fabricators of the Irish antiquities found than an early knowledge of letters in their country was absolutely necessary to gain credit to the system which they so much wished to establish. Ireland therefore was made the seat of polite lite-rature many ages before Greece itself rose

out of ignorance and barbarity. To re-move this support from the antiquities of the Irish, is to destroy at once that whole fabric of fiction, which they possess for their ancient history.
               
                  Reflections. The art of perpetuating ideas, and of transmitting the wisdom of one age to another, is the first means of civilizing mankind out of their natural ferocity and barbarity. When some certain marks are found to send down the memory of inventions and transactions through a se-ries of generations, a nation becomes polished in proportion to the length of time it has been in possession of that art. Before the Phoenicians taught the use of the alphabet to the Ionians
                     Gentium consensus tacitus, primus omnium con-spiravit ut Ionum literis uterentur. Plin.  
                     
                  , Pelopon-nesus and the Islands of Greece were pos-sessed by tribes as obscure and contempti-ble as those wild Indians, who wander through the forests of America. The progress of the Greeks towards the figure which they make in history, accompanied the gradual cultivation of polite learning in their country; and we find, that from a possession of letters for a few centuries, they arrived at such a pitch of civilization, that it was not without reason they distin-guished other nations by the name of Bar-barians.

                  , in point of time, with regard to the reception of letters, we ought naturally to expect that they be-came civilized in a very early period. The annals of Ireland are accordingly full of the progress of civility, and the encouragement given to polite learning in that country, many ages before any other nation in Europe extricated itself from the shades of ignorance and barbarity. But these annals deserve little credit on a matter of such high antiquity. The Psalter Cashel, the oldest record of the Irish transactions, was written in the latter end of the tenth age, more than two thousand years after the pretended importation of letters into Ireland.
               
                  confuted from the testimony of The only credible accounts of the man-ners of the old Irish, as well as of the other barbarous nations of Europe, must be derived from the writers of Rome; and these do not go beyond the com-mencement of the Christian aera, which is, at least a thousand years posterior to the period assigned by the Irish for the introduction of learning among their an-cestors. Unfortunately for the Hiber-nian system of antiquities, by the testi-mony of foreign writers who extended

their enquiries to Ireland, the character of its ancient inhabitants is utterly in-compatible with that civilization which invariably accompanies any knowledge of letters

                  .
               
                  Strabo, Strabo is the first writer who mentions any particulars concerning the manners of the old Irish. His account differs in no respect from the relations we have of the most unpolished savages of Africa and America. In one place
                     
                        
                           
                         
                        Strabo,  
                     
                   he affirms, that Ireland, which lies near Britain, is pos-sessed by a race of men altogether wild and unpolished; and in another he not only says that the Irish were much more barbarous than the Britons, but he even mentions several instances of their brutal ferocity of manners which decency ob-liges us to leave under the veil of a dead language
                     
                        
                           
                         Agrestissimi omnium Britannorum (sunt Hiberni) homines edunt, plurimum cibi vorant; pro honesto ducunt mortuorum parentum corpora comedere, et palam concubitum inire cum matribus et sororibus. Strabo,  
                       It is but justice to observe that Strabo does not vouch for the authenticity of the above account; but it is impos-sible to suppose that even the report of such barbarity could exist, had the Irish been more humanized than their Celtic brethren in Britain..
               
                  

                  Diodorus Siculus, The testimony of Diodorus Siculus is not more favourable, than that of Strabo, to the national character of the Irish. They were in the days of that writer so far from being civilized by a long possession of let-ters, that they were thought to feed upon human bodies. The authority of Dio-dorus not only destroys the fiction of the early knowledge of letters in Ireland, but also ruins that system of antiquities, to support which, the fiction itself was first framed. He shews that the Irish, so far from coming from a distant country, were a branch of those Gauls who had possessed themselves of Britain in the pe-riod we have already assigned

                  .
               
                  Pomponius Mela, The account given of the Irish by Pomponius Mela is extremely unfavour-able to their pretended civilization by a long possession of letters. He calls them a race of men unpolished, barbarous, and ignorant of every virtue
                     Cultores ejus (Hiberniae) inconditi, et omnium virtutum ignari, Pomp. Mela,  
                     
                  . Cornelius Tacitus, Cornelius Tacitus, after having described those rude tribes in Britain whom the Romans had

not humanized, observes, that the inha-bitants of Ireland did not differ much in their manners from the Britons
                     Ingenia cultusque hominum non multum a Bri-tannia differunt. Tacit. Vit. Agric. xxxiv.
                     
                  . Nei-ther was the national character of the old Hibernians mended at all in the se-cond or third centuryThe precise time in which Julius Solinus wrote is not well ascertained.,  Julius Soli-nus. when Julius So-linus stigmatized them with epithets of rude, inhuman, and inhospitable, a race of men who were in such a state of rude-ness that they made no distinction between right and wrong
                     Hibernia in humana ritu incolarum aspera, gens inhospita; fas atque nefas eodem animo ducunt. Soli-nus, xxxvi.
                     
                  .
               
                  Objections answered. In vain has it been said that the writers, whose authority we have cited, were ill-formed concerning the manners of the Irish, and that barbarity in which their country was anciently involved. The Britons, who, according to Strabo
                     
                        
                           
                         
                        Strabo,  
                     
                  , resorted to Rome, could not have been ignorant of the state of Ireland. From those Britons, we may conclude that both Strabo and Mela derived their informati-ons concerning the Hibernians; and in the days of Tacitus the ports of Ireland were so well known, that the celebrated writer could not possibly have been ig-norant

of the real character of its inha-bitants
                     Melius aditus portusque per commercia et nego-tiatores cogniti. Tacit. Vit. Agric. xxiv.
                     
                  . Solinus had even a better op-portunity than Strabo, Mela, and Ta-citus, to become acquainted with the manners of the Irish. Britain had been a province of the empire two centuries at least, before Solinus wrote. Some com-munication must have been maintained between the two Islands during that pe-riod, and of course the Romans could not have been strangers to the real man-ners of the inhabitants of Ireland.
               
                  The man-ners of the old Irish in-consistent with a knowledge of letters. The genuine national character of the Irish, at a time when their Senachies say they had been in possession of letters for more than a thousand years, being thus ascertained, we find it absolutely incon-sistent with learning, and that civility which is the invariable companion of lite-rature. It was from this consideration that the most learned and unbiassed among the moderns rejected, as mere fable and romance, what is related concerning letters in Ireland, prior to the mission of Patrick, and the reign of Leogaire. The celebrated Camden looked upon the bar-barity and ignorance of the ancient Irish as facts so well ascertained, that he pro-duces them as proofs that the Romans, who polished those nations whom they

subdued, never extended their empire to Ireland
                     Animum vix inducere possum ut hanc regionem, (Hiberniam) in Romanorum potestatem, ullo tempore, concessisse, credam. Faustum sane felixque Hiberniae faisset, si concessisset; certe barbariem exuisset; ubi-cunque enim Romani victores erant, victos humani-tate excoluerunt. Nec sane alibi per Europam, huma-nitatis, literarum et elegantiae cultus, nisi ubi illi impe-rarunt. Camden, in Hibernia.
                     
                  . Sir James Ware, though very zealous for the honour of his coun-try, gave no credit to the pretensions of the Irish to any knowledge of an alpha-bet, before they were introduced with Christianity
                     Per exiguam superesse notitiam rerum in Hibernia gestarum ante exortam ibi Evangeiii auroram liquido constat. Notandum quidem descriptiones fere omni-um, quae illis temporibus (ante Patricii in Hiberniam adventum,) extant, opera esse posteriorum seculorum. War. Antiq. Hiberniae.
                     
                  ; and the learned Usher, by his silence concerning the affairs of Ireland beyond the fifth age, seems to join issue upon that head with Ware
                     Usserius in analibus sacris.
                  .
               
                  The old Irish illite-rate, proved Bolandus and the industrious Innes have entered into a serious refutation of the pretensions of Ireland to letters in the times of Paganism. Both these writers, as well as Ware, prove from Nennius
                     Sanctus Patricius scripsit Abietoria 365 et eo am-plius numero. Nenn. lix.
                     
                  , that the first alphabet was taught in that Island by St. Patrick. To strengthen the assertion of Nennius, Ware produced the authority of Tirochan, who, in the seventh age, wrote the life of the apostle

of Ireland
                     Unde constat opinor, abgetoria significare alpha-betum, 
                           •
                        ive elementa quae scripsit et docuit  Patricius. War. Script. Hibern.  
                     
                  . To these authorities Innes subjoins some critical observations of his own, which in themselves are enough to destroy the credit of the whole legend concerning the literature of the Pagan Irish.
               
                  from their using fo-reign terms in their let-ters, &amp  The ingenious father very shrewdly ob-serves, that the bare terms which the Romans used in their letters, arts, and sciences, sufficiently demonstrate, with-out having recourse to history, that they derived their polite learning from Greece
                     Grammatica, Rhetorica, Logica, Philosophia, cum multis aliis.
                  . In the same manner the proper terms by which the Irish in their vulgar language, express every thing concerning letters and science, being Latin words hibernizedLitera, Lietar; Liber, Leabar; Lego, leagmi; Scribo, Scribmi; Penna, Penn, &amp  &amp  It is an un-accountable oversight in Flaherty, or in the Sena-chies, from whom he derived his information, to give the name of Taible filea to those wooden tables, upon which, it is pretended, the Pagan Irish wrote. Taible, if it is not derived from the English word Table, cer-tainly owes its origin to the tabula of the Romans. Had the credulous antiquary used the Irish Clar, he might have avoided a circumstance which bears hard upon his own system., leave no room to doubt that they were taught first to read and write by persons who spoke the Roman language. But as the Romans never entered Ireland, it is

certain that the Irish did not receive those terms immediately from that nation. The first preachers of the gospel in Ireland, who had their education at Rome, were consequently those who introduced into that country the knowledge of letters, and the Roman terms by which their dif-ferent uses were expressed.
               
                  from their want of written mo-numents; In vain, continues Innes, has Fla-herty
                     Ogygia xxx.
                  , and the ingenious father might have added many other Irish writers, af-firmed that Ireland is, or was possessed of any books, whether of poetry or history, written before the introduction of Chri-stianity into that Island
                     Innes' Critical Essay,  44.
                  . This is mani-festly begging the question, till these books are given to the public with literal translations and documents to prove their authority, their age, and where they have been preserved through so long a series of ages. The learned Ware, after all his enquiries, could not find one wri-ter of Irish history or antiquities prior to the author of the Psalter-Cashel, whom he places in the tenth century; though from what Ware himself cites from the Psalter in another place
                     Ware, presulibus Hiberniae.
                  , it must have been written after the commencement of the eleventh age.
               
                  

                  from the form of their alpha-bet; The arbitrary order in which the Irish of the middle ages placed their alphabet, and the fanciful appellations they gave them, prove only that the Hibernian Se-nachies formed a very early design to ceive the world on the article of their an-tiquities. But arguments arising from those two circumstances can only deceive those who have not compared old Irish manuscripts with the records of any other nation in Europe, prior to the invention of printing. The perfect indentity ob-servable in the forms of the letters in both sufficiently confutes this idle tale, unless we are to suppose that the Irish, and not the Romans, humanized and taught let-ters to all the European nations.
               
                  from the improbabi-lity of their assertions. It is unnecessary, with Bolandus and Innes, to pursue the abettors of the pre-tended literature of Ireland, before the mission of St. Patrick, through all the maze of a contest, in which positive as-sertions, on the side of the latter, supply the place of argument. To a brief detail of some other unanswerable objections advanced by the two learned writers, we shall annex some additional observations, to put an end for ever to the dispute. Keating, Flaherty, and Toland, up-on the authority of the book of Lecan, a manuscript scarcely three hundred and fifty years old, affirm that one Phenius Farsa invented the Hebrew, Greek,

Latin, and Irish alphabets, together with the Ogum of Ireland, little more than a century after the universal deluge. A legend which says that the Greek al-phabet was invented many ages before Cecrops and Cadmus, and the Latin characters seventeen centuries before the Romans were a people, is too ridiculous to deserve any serious consideration. But this idle story is not more pregnant with absurdity than the mention that is made of Adam, Cain, Noah, the deluge, Moses, Pharaoh, and many other names and transactions in the old testament, in annals said to have been written many ages before Christianity introduced into Europe any knowledge of the Jewish history and antiquities.
               
                  The Ogum a species of stenogra-phy. The Irish being in some measure ob-liged to acknowledge that the Bethluis-nion, notwithstanding the arbitrary trans-portation of the letters, and the puerile fancy of imposing upon them the names of trees, by the Bards and Senachies of the middle ages, was borrowed from the Latin, still continue to insist that their ancestors in remote antiquity, made use of characters distinguished by the name of Ogum. Ogum is a word which has no affinity with any other in the Irish language, and seems therefore to have been a cant-name imposed upon a species of stenography or cypher, in which the

old Irish, like many other nations, wrote their secrets. Sir James Ware, whose authority is often cited to prove the ex-istence of the Ogum, shews plainly that it was a kind of short hand, varied ac-cording to the fancy of those that used it, and consequently that it did not merit the title of an alphabet
                     Praeter Caracteres vulgares utebantur veteres Hi-berni variis occultls scribendi formulis, seu artificiis Ogum dictis, quibus secreta sua scribebant. Ware, Antiq. Hibern.

                  Contradic-tions be-tween the ancient and modern Irish anna-lists. There is no circumstance more con-clusive against the learning of the Pagan Irish, than the contradictions between the ancient writers, and those of the modern annalists of Ireland. The anti-quaries of that country, in proportion as the general history of the world became more and more known to them, reformed, new-modelled, and retrenched the ex-travagancies of the first rude draught of Hibernian antiquities formed by the Bards and Fileas. Had letters been cul-tivated in Ireland in so early a period as is pretended, systems of the history of that country would have been so anciently formed, and so well established by the sanction of their antiquity, that neither Keating or Flaherty durst, in the se-venteenth age, give a compleat turn to the Irish antiquities. But that no such system was formed, is demonstrable from

the silence concerning the times of Hea-thenism, in the most ancient annals of Ireland, of the existence of which we have any satisfactory proofThese are the annals of Ulster, Tigernach, and Innisfail, all of which begin the history of Ireland a-bout the middle of the fifth age, and end in the eleventh century.

                  Decisive proof a-gainst the pretended literature of the old Irish. To close with one decisive argument this controversy: It is to be observed that the settlement of the Milesians, un-der the name of Scots, in Ireland, about a thousand years before the Christian aera, is the capital point established by the pretended literature of the Heathen Irish. Should this early settlement be once as-certained, it naturally ought to follow that the British Scots derived their blood from those of Ireland; if they did, they must have carried with them to Caledo-nia that learning, science, and civility, which had made so great a progress in their mother-country before they transmigrated from it. But nothing is more certain than that the British Scots were an illi-terate people, and involved in barbarism, even after St. Patrick mission to the Scots of Ireland. The abettors of the Irish antiquities are then reduced into this dilemma; either the Scots of North Britain did not derive their origin from Ireland, or else the Irish had not any

knowledge of letters when the British Scots transmigrated from their country. If the first position is true, the whole credit of the Milesian story is at an end; if the latter, on the other hand, is the fact, no memory remains in Ireland of transactions prior to the mission of St. Pa-trick, and the reign of Leogaire.
               
                  General conclusions. From the general result of our enquiry upon this subject, we may conclude with Sir James Ware, that nothing certain is known concerning the affairs of Ireland before the middle of the fifth age
                     predecessores Leogarii quod attinet, eos certe consilio omisi quia pleraque quae iis traduntur, ut quod sentio dicam, vel fabulae sunt, vel fabulis et ana-chronismis mire admixta. War. Antiq. Hib. cap. 
                     
                  . We may also, with the same learned writer

                  , take it for granted that the account of their Heathen ancestors, retailed by the annalists, antiquaries, and historians of Ireland, are the impostures of later ages
                     Notandum quidem descriptiones fere omnium, quae illis temporibus, antiquioribus dico, extant. OPERA ESSE POSTERIORUM SECULORUM. Waraeus, ubi supra.
                     
                  . It were to be wished that the writers of that country, who understood the ancient Galic, had not given room to suspect that they themselves were conscious of those impostures, by their concealing from the

public those monuments of their ancient history from which they pretend to derive their information. But had they given them to the world, it is highly probable that external argument would be very unnecessary to prove that the literature of Ireland commenced with the mission of St. Patrick.
               
                  Irish writers reprehend It is a matter of some wonder that the Irish remain so long wedded to a ridicu-lous system of antiquities, which throws the reproach of credulity upon their na  Every other polished people, who, in the times of ignorance, had set up high schemes of antiquity, have now ex-tricated their history from the fables of their dark ages. Had there been a scar-city of men of abilities and learning in Ireland, some excuse might be framed for this blind attachment to the legends of the bards. But as that country hath pro-duced very able men, and qualified to form a solid foundation for a true history of their ancestors, they deserve to be se-verely animadverted upon, for not rescu their antiquities, from that obscurity and fiction in which they have been in-volved, by some modern, prejudiced, and injudicious writers.
            
         
         
            

            ANTIQUITIES OF THE British and Irish Scots.
            
               Preliminary Observations.
               
                  General ob-servation. THE dark regions of Irish antiquity oppose more than their barrenness to inquiry. To the common gloom, which covers the origin of other nations, the Bards of Ireland have added clouds of their own. The desart of their ancient history, to use a metaphor, is haunted by goblins and strange forms, which distract the attention and offend the eye. To encounter the absurdities which the more ancient Irish posses for the annals of their remote ages, is not an arduous, but a disagreeable and tedious task. The field is ample, but it produces no laurels; the combat is not dangerous, but the victory will be attended by no same. But the professed design of this work gives propriety to a minute inquiry into the pretensions of Ireland to high anti-quities, and the public, it is hoped, will

forgive the prolixity of the disquisition, on account of the necessity which has imposed so dry a subject upon the Author.
               
                  Conclusions against the domestic accounts of the Irish. From the principles already established we may draw the following just conclu-sions: That the history of the Milesian colony, which, it is pretended, transmi-grated from Spain into Ireland under the conduct of Heremon and Heber, is ab-solutely unworthy of any credit: That the long list of kings, who are said to have held the scepter of Ireland, for thirteen centuries before the Christian aera, had their existence only in the dis-tempered fancies of the Bards of latter ages; and, in short, that every thing re-lated in their domestic annals concerning the Irish, prior to the mission of St. Pa-trick, ought to be banished to the region of fiction and romance. Whatever drea-mers in remote antiquities may be pleased to say, it is an indisputable fact, that the transactions of a nation, illiterate in itself, and too distant or obscure to be distinctly seen by foreign writers, must for ever lie buried in oblivion. The Irish, we have already seen, were so far from having the advantage of the Greeks and Romans in an earlier knowledge of let-ters
                     Ken. Geneal. pref.  26.
                  , that, on the contrary, they re-mained

much longer in ignorance than the inhabitants of the regions of the West and North, whom the latter of those il-lustrious nations subdued and humanized.
               
                  History of Ireland commences with St. Patrick. The only means the old Irish had to preserve the memory of their actions were the rhimes of the Bards, a race of men retained by the illiterate nations scended from the great Celtic stock. Without insisting on the known uncer-tainty of history in rhime, we may affirm that a dull narrative of facts in verse could never take hold of the human mind in a degree sufficient to transmit a knowledge of events, by oral tradition, through any considerable length of time. Granting then every possible indulgence to the tra-ditionary history of Ireland, we cannot admit that it extends much beyond the middle of the fifth age, if even to record the rhimes of the Heathen Bards had been the first use made of the alphabet intro-duced by St. Patrick. But as it is not, in any degree, probable that the first con-verts in Ireland would employ their time in collecting and recording historical poems, which were tinctured, perhaps, with the ancient superstition, we may naturally place the commencement of the fabulous, as well as of the true history of that Island, posterior to the introduction of Christianity.
            
            
               

               Spanish Extraction of the Irish examined and confuted.
               
                  Spanish ex-traction of the Irish before the Christian aera The Irish annalists have, for many ages, adhered invariably to the pretended descent of their nation from the old Spa-niards. The confidence with which they have always spoken on this subject, in-duced some learned men, who gave no credit to an early knowledge of letters in Ireland, to suppose that there was some foundation in fact for a story, concerning which, tradition had brought intimations from every quarter. But to those who have well considered the state of ancient Europe, it will appear just as improbable that the Spaniards could transport them-selves into Ireland before the Christian aera, as it is impossible to believe that any memory of that event, had it actually happened, could have been preserved by tradition to the introduction of letters by St. Patrick.
               
                  highly im-probable. It does not appear that much of the knowledge of the arts of civil life was extended to the inhabitants of the moun-tains of Asturia and Gallicia, from the settlement established by the Phoenicians in the Island of Gades. So far were the

old Spaniards, who possessed the shore of the Atlantic, from improving themselves in navigation by their vicinity to the ocean, that Strabo affirms

                  , that from their situation they were cut off from all commerce with the rest of mankind. Of all the inhabitants of the Celtiberian di-vision of Spain, Diodorus Siculus re-marks

                  , that the Vaccaei were the most humanized, for they had some knowledge in agriculture. But if a small skill in one of the earliest and rudest arts entitled the Vaccaei to the character of a civilized people, when compared to the neighbouring tribes, we may, with jus-tice, conclude that those tribes had not made a progress in navigation sufficient to make them venture into the ocean, and transport a colony into Ireland.
               
                  Dropt as in-defensible. The scheme of deducing the Irish Scotch from the Spaniards prior to the Christian aera, was dropt as indefensible by those of the most learning and judg-ment, who examined the subject. After Innes had destroyed the credit of the

Milesian tale, he found it necessary to in-vestigate the origin of the Scots in some other way. He proposed to himself as a question, from whence, and at what period, came the Scots into Ireland? They came, fays the ingenious father, either from Scandia or Cantabria, a-bout the time of the incarnation, or rather a little time after it"

                  Vague con-clusions of English an-tiquaries. The antiquaries of England either did not examine with attention the origin of the Scots, or, averse to enter into a con-test with the Irish about a matter in which their own nation was not material-ly concerned, spoke very undecisively on this subject. Stillingfleet thought that the Scots were Scythians from Scandi-navia; but the time of their transmigra he does not attempt to assign

                  . Cam-den, contrary to his usual precision, is full of uncertainty on this head. They were, says the celebrated writer, Scythi-ans from Spain, Scandia, or Germany. At one time he makes them the posterity of those Goths whom Constantine expel-led from Spain; at another time, they are a motley aggregate of many nations; and last of all they are descendants of those Britons who first possessed themselves of Ireland

                  Innes' scheme. It is idle, on this subject to listen to the tales of the Bards, annalists, and an-tiquariers of Ireland; they have been heard out and confuted. Innes is the only writer who has reduced the origin of the Scots into a regular system; and he endeavours to defend it. Should the in-genious father scheme be destroyed, the Caledonian extraction of the Irish must of course rise upon its ruins. The Scots, says Innes, were foreigners who invaded or conquered Ireland in the first age of Christianity. Two kinds of proofs, ob-serves the ingenious father, are necessary to establish this proposition; the testimony of cotemporary writers, and the effects arising from such an invasion and con-quest.
               
                  Proofs from the ancients against it. In vain did Innes search for the testi-mony of writers to support the credit of this Hibernian revolution
                     Innes' Critical Essay,  509.
                  . Diodorus Siculus, Diodorus Siculus, who mentions the Irish a little time before the Christian aera, says ex-pressly that they were Britons, who had derived their blood from the Gauls

                   observations on the national character of the Irish is a strong argument against the Cantabric descent of that nation. Mela himself was a Spaniard, he had some interest in the Gallaeci, and could not have been igno-rant of the Cantabric war. Had he learned, and had any such event happened it must have come to his knowledge, that, after all the efforts of Augustus in person, or by his lieutenants, Antistius, Furnius, Carisius, and Agrippa, the Cantabri col-lected a body of men, committed them-selves to the ocean, and seized upon Ire-land, from a natural partiality for his countrymen he would have treated the Irish with more decency and respect.
               
                  Tacitus, Cornelius Tacitus wrote the life of Agricola before the conclusion of the first age. Agricola had formed a plan to re-duce Ireland under the Roman yoke. The low idea that great commander en-tertained of the number and valor of the Irish is an unanswerable proof that the Cantabric descent of that nation is a mere fiction. Had any considerable body of those brave Spaniards, who fought against Augustus and his lieutenants, transmigrated into Ireland, Agricola could not suppose that a single legion was suf-ficient

to subjugate and maintain the conquest of that Island. It is idle, in short, to expect from Tacitus any support to Innes' Spanish system. The celebrated writer, from the best information,
                     Saepe ex eo (Agricola vel ipso Hiberno; nonnulli enim existimant  Tacitum in Caledonia militasse) audivi, legione una et modicis auxiliis debellari obtinerique Hiberniam posse. Tacit. Vit. Agric. cap. 24.

                  , affirms, that the British and Hibernians were men of much the same genius and manners, and from that circumstance we may infer that the two nations derived their origin from one common source.

                   on the Irish of the second or third age, Innes concludes that the Scots, a valiant body of foreigners, were settled among them before the time of that writer. It is difficult to com-prehend why a mixture of foreign blood should be necessary to make the Irish a warlike people. If the situation of their country secured them from invasion, the civil dissentions arising from their being divided into a number of petty septs would have undoubtedly kindled and preserved a martial spirit among them. But if a

colony from abroad was requisite to enti-tle the inhabitants of Ireland to the cha-racter of a brave race of men, it is more natural to suppose that some of the Bri-tons of the South, or of the Caledonians of the North, settled among them, than emigrants from Cantabria. Tacitus says, and indeed it is common sense, that many Britons fled into Ireland from the tyranny of the Romans.
               
                  Ptolomy. Ptolemy, who wrote under the Anto-nines, has not once mentioned the Scots, though he is very minute with regard to inferior tribes settled in Ireland. The geographer found in the lesser Britain the Brigantes, Vellabori, Cauci, and Me-napii, but the redoubtable Scots of Can-tabria totally escaped his notice. Camden, willing to humour the Irish in their pre-tensions to a Spanish extract, has ob-served that the Lucensii and Concani were neighbours in Spain, as the Luceni and Gongani were in Hibernia. If this is an argument, others of the same kind and of equal force may be produced to oppose it. The Cauci and Menapii were neighbours in Germany, and so were tribes of the same name, according to Ptolemy, in Ireland. Shall we then bring some Irish tribes from Cantabria, others from Germany, transport the Brigantes from South Britain, and totally exclude all emigrants from Caledonia, which is with-in

a few leagues of the Irish shore? Camden observation might have been extended further; the Iberians and Alba-nians were contiguous to one another in Asia; the Hibernians and Albanians pos-sessed the British Isles, divided from one another by a very narrow channel; and ought we from that circumstance to infer, that the Caledonians and Irish came from the shores of the Caspian?
               
                  Orosius, In the days of Orosius the Irish were distinguished by the name of Scottish clans. Orosius does not say from whence these Scottish tribes transmigrated into Ireland. Though a Spaniard himself, he has not mentioned, in treating of the Cantabric war, a circumstance that would have done honour to his country; that a great body of the Cantabri, rather than submit to Augustus, or to skulk in moun-tains and desarts, or throw in despair their lives away like many of their countrymen, committed themselves to the Ocean, and acquired in Ireland better settlements than those for which they contended, with so much unavailing bravery against the Ro-mans.
               
                  Florus Florus is another writer of Spanish ex-traction. He was evidently partial to the Cantabri, but he does not even furnish an obscure hint that either of the two warlike nations who were engaged in

the last Spanish war against the Romans, had, after their unsuccessful efforts to fend their liberty, found new settlements in the neighbouring ocean. The greatest part of the Cantabri, according to Florus, after being hard pressed both by sea and land, driven out of their fastnesses, hunted down like wild beasts, and, at last, in-closed within lines of circumvallation, rescued themselves from slavery by a vo-luntary death. A series of similar mis-fortunes pursued the Asturians; after having inclosed themselves within walls, they were taken by the armies of Rome, the whole nation were transplanted from their native mountains to the plain coun-try, and an end for ever put to Spanish insurrections.
               
                  The Irish not a Spa-nish colony proved from their lan-guage. In the whole history of the Cantabric war it is impossible to find a Spanish na  hostile to the Romans, that were able to equip transports for a colony, escape the vigilance of the Roman navy, and numerous enough to conquer or peo-ple Ireland. In vain has Innes availed himself of a pretended analogy between the Biscayan dialect and the language of Ireland, to support his scheme of the Spanish extract of the Scots. That the most ancient inhabitants of Galicia were mixed with Celtes is a point sufficiently established by the authority of many of

the ancients
                     Ephorus ingenti magnitudine facit Celticam; quod illi (scilicet Celtae) pleraque ejus Terrae, quam nunc Iberiam vocamus, loca usque Gades tenuerint. Strabo,  
                      
                     Galli occidua usque Gades inco-lunt secundum Eratosthenem. Strabo,  
                      
                     Hi (Celtiberi) duo enim populi lberes et Celtae. Diod. Sic.  
                      Martial, speaking to Lucius, of Spain their common country, says, Nos Celtis genitos. Martial Epig.
                      
                     Gallorum Celtae miscentes nomen Iberis. Lucan,

                  ; and therefore that they originally spoke in part the same language with the Gaël who first transmigrated into Britain, may, from the circumstance of the descent common to both nations, be inferred. The sterility of the moun-tains of Galicia would never invite new settlers whom the bravery of the old in-habitants could not repel. They conse-quently remained an unmixed people, and the simplicity of their manners preserved their language from corruption. A simi-lar situation had a similar effect on the Scots of the British Isles. The north of Scotland received no colonies in any pe-riod that can be assigned; and the Irish remained, in a great measure, unmixed until the English conquest of their coun-try. But notwithstanding circumstances common to the Cantabri and the Scots of both our Isles, the language of the latter has less affinity with the modern Bis-cayan, than the English tongue has with

that of the Moguls of the eastern Tar-taryThat the language of the mountaineers of Gali-cia, and that part of Spain which stretches along the Bay of Biscay, bears a near analogy to the language of the old Irish, has been an axiom universally admitted. This has been the last resort, the unanswerable argu-ment, to which all the Irish antiquaries have referred the certainty of the Spanish extraction of their nation. Unfortunately for the old Hibernian system, a dictio-nary of the Biscayan language is, at this moment, in the possession of the Author of the Introduction, and he publickly declares that there is less affinity between the Biscayan and Irish languages, than between the latter and the tongue of the most distant nations in the eastern Asia. The curious may satisfy themselves upon this head by looking into Diccionario Trilingue del Castel-lano BASCUENCE  Latin, written by the Padre Ma-nuel Larramendi, and printed in 1745 at St. Sebastians. This discovery seems to confirm the opinion of Varro, who, as he is cited by Pliny, insinuates that the Iberi-ans of Spain were of African origin. The language of the modern Biscayans, it is certain, bears no affinity to the other European tongues, which are radically scended from the ancient Celtic. The name of Iberi-ans given to them in contradistinction to the Celtae is a proof of their being a different people. Lucan seems to insinuate this fact in a line already quoted; Gallo-rum Celtae miscentes nomen Iberis; and the Venere Celtae sociati nomen Iberis of Silius Italicus, together with the express testimony of Diodorus Siculus and Appian, confirms the opinion..
            
            
               

               Scandinavian Extraction of the Irish confuted.
               
                  Pretended Scandina-vian descent of the Irish confuted. If Innes had little reason to deduce the Scots from Spain, he had still less to rive them from any of the nations of Scandinavia. Neither he or Stillingfleet were able, with all their erudition, to sup-port a Scandinavian migration into Ireland, in the first age, by the authority of any cotemporary writer. One argument will be perhaps sufficient to destroy the credit of this part of the ingenious father scheme. The language of the Scandina-vians, being a branch of the Sarmatic, is radically different from the Hibernian and British Galic. It must be acknowledged that the ancients sometimes distinguished the Germans, as well as those nations who inhabited beyond the Baltic, by the name of Scythians. But it is extremely puerile to infer, from the remote analogy between the name of Scythians and Scots, that the latter nation derived their blood either from the Germans or old Scandi-navians. The Danes, for a similar rea-son, might deduce themselves from the Danai of Greece; and the Caledonians of North Britain trace themselves to those of the same name in Aetolia.
