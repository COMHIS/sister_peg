"passed: Mr. Ray is to be valued for"
"his Observations on the Natural"
"Productions of the Place. Monsieur"
"Mission has wrote a more correct"
"Account of Italy in general than"
"any before him, as he particularly"
"Excels in the Plan of the Country,"
"which he has given us in true and"
"lively Colours."
"            There are still several of these"
"Topicks that are far from being"
"exhausted, as there are many new"
"Subjects that a Traveller may find"
"to employ himself upon. For my"
"own part, as I have taken Notice of"
"'several Places and Antiquities that"
"no Body else has spoken of, so, I"
"think, I have mentioned but few"
"Things in common with others, that"
"are notei ther set in a new Light,"
"or accompanyed with different Re-flections."
"I have taken care parti-cularly"
"to consider the several Pas-sages"
"of the Ancient Poets, which"
"have any Relation to the Places"
"or Curiosities that I met with: For"
"before I entered on my Voyage I took"
"as agreeable as any part of the Action."
"Could we suppose that a Mask represent-ed"
"never so naturally the general Hu-mour"
"of a Character, it can never suit"
"with the Variety of Passions that are in-cident"
"to every single Person in the whole"
"Course of a Play. The Grimace may"
"be proper on some Occasions, but is too"
"'steady to agree with all. The Rabble"
"indeed are generally pleased at the first"
"Entry of a Disguise, but the Jest grows"
"cold even with them too when it comes"
"on the Stage in a Second Scene."
"            Since I am on this Subject, I cannot"
"forbear mentioning a Custom at Venice,"
"which they tell me is particular to the"
"common People of this Country, of sing-ing"
"Stanza out of Tasso. They are set"
"to a pretty Solemn Tune, and when one"
"begins in any part of the Poet, it is odds"
"but he will be answered by some Body"
"else that over-hears him: So that some-times"
"you have Ten or a Dozen in the"
"Neighbourhood of one another, taking"
"Verse after Verse, and running on with"
"the Poem as far as their Memories will"
"carry them."
"            On Holy-Thursday, among the seve-ral"
"Shows that are yearly exhibited, I"
"'saw one that is odd enough, and parti-cular"
"to the Venetians. There is a Set"
"of Artisans, who by the help of several"
"Poles, which they lay across each others"
"Shoulders, build themselves up into a"
"kind of Pyramid; so that you see a"
"Pile of Men in the Air of Four or Five"
"Rows rising one above another. The"
"Weight is so equally distributed, that"
"every Man is very well able to bear his part"
"of it, the Stories, if I may so call them,"
"growing less and less as they advance high-er"
"and higher. A little Boy represents the"
"Point of the Pyramid, who, after a"
"'short space, leaps off, with a great deal"
"of Dexterity, into the Arms of one that"
"catches him at the Bottom. In the same"
"manner the whole Building falls to pie-ces."
"I have been the more particular on"
"this, because it explains the following"
"Verses of Claudian, which show that the"
"Venetians are not the Inventors of this"
"Trick."
"                  Vel qui mere avium sese jaculantur in auras,"

"            "
"            though  we meet with the Veneti in the"
"old Poets, the City of Venice is too mo-dern"
"to find a Place among them. San-nazarius's"
"Epigram is too well known"
"to be inserted. The same Poet has ce-lebrated"
"this City in Two other Places"

"were dryed,"
"                  And Nature self lay ready to expire,"

"contain,"

"                  Nor would the Danube run with greater"
"Force,"

"throws."

"            That is, says Scaliger, the Eridanus"
"would be bigger than the Nile and Da-nube,"
"if the Nile and Danube were not"
"bigger than the Eridanus. What makes"
"the Poet Remark the more improper,"
"the very Reason why the Danube is"
"greater than the Po, as he assigns it, is"
"that which really makes the Po as great"
"as it is; for before its Fall into the Gulf,"
"it receives into its Channel the most con-siderable"
"Rivers of Piemont, Milan, and"
"the rest of Lombardy."

"From Venice to Ancona the Tide"
"comes in very sensibly at its stated Pe-riods,"
"but rises more or less in proportion"
"as it advances nearer the Head of the"
"Gulf. Lucan has run out of his way to"
"describe this Phaenomenon, which is in-deed"
"very extraordinary to those who"
"lye out of the Neighbourhood of the"
"great Ocean, and, according to his sual"
"Custom, lets his Poem stand still"
"that he may give way to his own Re-flections."

"            At Ferrara I met nothing extraordi-nary."
"The Town is very large, but ex-treamly"
"thin of People. It has a Cita-del,"
"and something like a Fortification"
"running round it, but so large that it"
"requires more Soldiers to defend it, than"
"the Pope has in his whole Dominions."
"The Streets are as beautiful as any I have"
"'seen, in their Length, Breadth, and Re-gularity."
"The Benedictins have the finest"
"Convent of the Place. They showed"
"us in the Church Aristo Monument:"
"His Epitaph says, he was Nobilitate ge-neris"
"atque Animi clarus, in rebus publicis"
"administrandis, in regendis populis, in gra-vissimis"

"prudentiâ, consilio, eloquentiâ praestantissi-mus."
"            "
"            I came down a Branch of the Po, as"
"far as Alberto, within Ten Miles of Ra-venna."
"All this Space lyes miserably un-cultivated"
"'till you come near Ravenna,"
"where the Soil is made extreamly fruit-ful,"
"and shows that much of the rest"
"might, be were there. Hands enough to"
"manage it to the best Advantage. It is"
"now on both sides the Road very Marshy,"
"and generally over-grown with Rushes,"
"which made me fancy it was once float-ed"
"by the Sea, that lyes within Four"
"Miles of it. Nor could I in the least"
"doubt it when I saw Ravenna, that is"
"now almost at the same distance from"
"the Adriatic, though  it was formerly the"
"most famous of all the Roman Ports."
"            One may guess at its ancient Situation"
"from Martial's"

"care to refresh my Memory among"
"the Classic Authors, and to make"
"'such Collections out of them as I"
"might afterwards have Occasion"
"for. I must confess it was not one"
"of the least Entertainments that I"
"met with in Travelling, to examine"
"these several Descriptions, as it"
"were, upon the Spot, and to compare"
"the Natural Face of the Country"
"with the Landskips that the Poets"
"have given us of it. However,"
"to avoid the Confusion that might"
"arise from a Multitude of Quotati-ons,"
"I have only cited such Verses"
"as have given us some Image of the"
"Place, or that have something else"
"besides the bare Name of it to re-commend"
"them."

"has given us of it."
"                  Quàque gravi remo limosis segniter undis"

"            "
"            Accordingly the old Geographers re-present"
"it as situated among Marshes and"
"Shallows. The Place which is shown"
"for the Haven, is on a Level with the"
"Town, and has probably been stopped"
"up by the great Heaps of Dirt that the Sea"
"has thrown into it; for all the Soil on"
"that side of Ravenna has been left there"
"insensibly by the Sea discharging it self"
"upon it for so many Ages. The Ground"
"must have been formerly much lower,"
"for otherwise the Town would have"
"lain under Water. The Remains of the"
"Pharos, that stand about Three Miles"
"from the Sea, and Two from the Town,"
"have their Foundations covered with"
"Earth for some Yards, as they told me,"
"which notwithstanding are upon a Level"
"with the Fields that lye about them,"
"tho'  it is probable they took the Advan-tage"
"of a rising Ground to set it upon."
"It was a square Tower of about Twelve"
"Yards in Breadth, as appears by that"
"part of it which yet remains entire, so"
"that its Height must have been very con-siderable"
"to have preserved a Proportion."
"It is made in the Form of the Venetian"
"Campanello, and is probably the high"
"Tower mentioned by Pliny,  36."
"cap. 12."
"            On the side of the Town, where the"
"Sea is supposed to have lain formerly,"
"there is now a little Church called the"
"Rotonda. At the Entrance of it are Two"
"Stones, the one with an Inscription in"
"Gothic Characters, that has nothing in"
"it remarkable; the other is a square"
"Piece of Marble, that by the Inscription"
"appears ancient, and by the Ornaments"
"about it shows it self to have been a lit-tle"
"Pagan Monument of Two Persons"
"who were Shipwrecked, perhaps in the"
"Place where now their Monument stands."
"The first Line and a half, that tells their"
"Names and Families in Prose, is not le-gible;"
"the rest runs thus,"
"                  —Raniae domus hos produxit alumnos,"

"                     Both with the same Indulgent Master"
"blessed,"
"                     On the same Day their Liberty possessed:"
"                     A Shipwreck slew whom it had joined"
"before,"

"            "
"            There is a Turn in the Third Verse"
"that we lose, by not knowing the Cir-cumstances"
"of their Story. It was the"
"Naufraga mors which destroyed them,"
"as it had formerly united them; what"
"this Union was is expressed in the pre-ceding"
"Verse, by their both having been"
"made Free-men on the same Day. If"
"therefore we suppose they had been for-merly"
"Shipwrecked with their Master,"
"and that he made them Free at the same"
"time, the Epigram is unriddled. Nor is"
"this Interpretation perhaps so forced as"
"it may seem at first sight, since it was"
"the Custom of the Masters, a little be-fore"
"their Death, to give their Slaves"
"their Freedom, if they had deserved it at"
"their Hands; and it is natural enough"
"to suppose one, involved in a common"
"Shipwreck, would give such of his Slaves"
"their Liberty, as should have the good"
"Luck to save themselves. The Chancel"
"of this Church is vaulted with a single"
"Stone of Four Foot in Thickness, and"
"a Hundred and Fourteen in Circumfe-rence."
"There stood on the Outside of"

"Virgin, arrayed like a Queen, with"
"a Scepter in her Hand, and a Crown up-on"
"her Head; for having delivered the"

"Bridge of Five Arches, built by Augustus"

"legible, though  not rightly transcribed by"
"Gruter. A Triumphal Arch raised by Au-gustus,"
"which makes a Noble Gate to the"
"Town, though  part of it is ruined. The"
"Ruins of an Amphitheater. The Sug-gestum,"
"on which it is said that Julius"
"Caesar harangued his Army after having"
"passed the Rubicon. I must confess I can"
"by no means look on this last as Authen-tick:"
"It is built of hewn Stone, like the"
"Pedestal of a Pillar, but something high-er"
"than ordinary, and is but just broad"
"enough for one Man to stand upon it."
"On the contrary, the ancient Sugge-stums,"
"as I have often observed on Me-dals,"
"as well as on Constantine Arch,"
"were made of Wood like a little kind of"
"Stage, for the Heads of the Nails are"
"'sometimes represented, that are supposed"
"to have fastened the Boards together. We"
"often see on them the Emperor, and"
"Two or Three General Officers, some-times"
"'sitting and sometimes standing, as"
"they made Speeches, or distributed a"
"Congiary to the Soldiers or People."
"They were probably always in readiness,"
"and carried among the Baggage of the"

"been built on the Place, and required"
"'some time before it could be finished."

"            THE"
"REPUBLICK"
"OF"
"St. MARINO."
"            "
"               THE Town and Republick of"
"St. Marino stands on the Top"
"of a very high and craggy"
"Mountain. It is generally"
"hid among the Clouds, and"
"lay under Snow when I saw it, though  it"
"was clear and warm Weather in all the"
"Country about it. There is not a Spring"
"or Fountain, that I could hear of, in the"
"whole Dominions, but they are always"
"well provided with huge Cisterns and"
"Reservoirs of Rain and Snow-Water."
"The Wine that grows on the sides of"
"their Mountain is extraordinary good,"
"and I think much better than any I met"
"with on the cold side of the Appenines."
"This puts me in Mind of their Cellars,"
"which have most of 'em a natural vantage"
"that renders 'em extreamly cool"
"in the hottest Seasons, for they have ge-nerally"
"in the Sides of them deep Holes"
"that run into the Hollows of the Hill,"
"from whence there constantly issues a"
"breathing kind of Vapour, so very chil-ling"
"in the Summer time, that a Man"
"can scarce suffer his Hand in the Wind of"
"it."
"            This Mountain, and a few neighbour-ing"
"Hillocks that lye scattered about the"
"Bottom of it, is the whole Circuit of"
"these Dominions. They have, what"
"they call, Three Castles, Three Convents,"
"and Five Churches, and can reckon about"
"Five Thousand Souls in their Communi-ty."
"The Inhabitants as well as the Histori-ans,"
"who mention this little Republick,"
"give the following Account of its Original."
"St. Marino was its Founder, a Dalmatian"
"by Birth, and by Trade a Mason. He"
"was employed above Thirteen Hundred"
"Years ago in the Reparation of Rimini,"
"and, after he had finished his Work,"
"retired to this solitary Mountain, as find-ing"
"it very proper for the Life of a Her-mit,"
"which he led in the greatest Ri-gours"
"and Austerities of Religion. He"
"had not been long here before he wrought"
"a reputed Miracle, which, joined with"
"his extraordinary Sanctity, gained him"
"'so great an Esteem, that the Princess of"
"the Country made him a Present of the"
"Mountain to dispose of it at his own Di-scretion."
"His Reputation quickly Peo-pled"
"it, and gave Rise to the Republick"
"which calls it self after his Name. So that"
"the Common-wealth of Marino may boast"
"at least of a nobler Original than that of"
"Rome, the one having been at first an"
"Asylum for Robbers and Murderers, and"
"the other a Resort of Persons eminent for"
"their Piety and Devotion. The best of"
"their Churches is Dedicated to the Saint,"
"and holds his Ashes. His Statue stands"
"over the high Altar, with the Figure of"
"a Mountain in its Hands, crowned with"
"Three Castles, which is likewise the"
"Arms of the Common-wealth. They at-tribute"
"to his Protection the long Dura-tion"
"of their State, and look on him as"
"the greatest Saint next the Blessed Virgin."
"I saw in their Statute-Book a Law a-gainst"
"'such as speak disrespectfully of him,"
"who are to be punished in the same man-ner"
"as those who are Convicted of Blas-phemy."
"            This petty Republick has now lasted"
"Thirteen hundred Years, while all the"
"other States of Italy have several times"
"changed their Masters and Forms of Go-vernment."
"Their whole History is com-prised"
"in Two Purchases, which they"
"made of a neighbouring Prince, and in"
"a War in which they assisted the Pope"
"against a Lord of Rimini. In the Year"
"1100 they bought a Castle in the Neigh-bourhood,"
"as they did another in the"
"Year 1170. The Papers of the Condi-tions"
"are preserved in their Archives,"
"where  it is very remarkable that the"
"Name of the Agent for the Common-wealth,"
"of the Seller, of the Notary,"
"and the Witnesses, are the same in both"
"the Instruments, though  drawn up at Seven-ty"
"Years distance from each other. Nor"
"can it be any Mistake in the Date, be-cause"
"the Popes and Emperors Names,"
"with the Year of their respective Reigns,"
"are both punctually set down. About"
"290 Years after this they assisted Pope"
"Pius the Second against one of the Ma-latesta "
"who was then Lord of Rimini;"
"and when they had helped to conquer"
"him, received from the Pope, as a Re-ward"
"for their Assistance, Four little Ca-stles."
"This they represent as the flou-rishing"
"Time of the Common-wealth,"
"when their Dominions reached half way"
"up a neighbouring Hill; but at present"
"they are reduced to their old Extent."
"They would probably sell their Liberty"
"as dear as they could to any that attacked"
"them; for there is but one Road by"
"which to climb up to them, and they"
"have a very severe Law against any of"
"their own Body that enters the Town"
"by another Path, lest any new one"
"'should be worn on the Sides of their"
"Mountain. All that are capable of bear-ing"
"Arms are exercised, and ready at a"
"Moment Call."
"            The Sovereign Power of the Repub-lick"
"was lodged originally in what they"
"call the Arengo, a great Council in which"
"every House had its Representative. But"
"because they found too much Confusion"
"in such a Multitude of Statesmen, they"
"devolved their whole Authority into the"
"Hands of the Council of Sixty. The"
"Arengo however is still called together"
"in Cases of extraordinary Importance;"
"and if, after due Summons, any Mem-ber"
"absents himself, he is to be Fined to"
"the value of about a Penny English, which"
"the Statute says he shall pay, Sine ali-quâ"
"diminutione aut gratiâ. In the ordi-nary"
"Course of Government, the Coun-cil"
"of Sixty (which, notwithstanding"
"the Name; consists but of Forty Persons)"
"has in its Hands the Administration of"
"Affairs, and is made up half out of the"
"Noble Families, and half out of the"
"Plebeian. They decide all by Baloting,"
"are not admitted 'till Five and Twenty"
"Years old, and chuse the Officers of the"
"Common-wealth."
"            Thus far they agree with the Great"
"Council of Venice, but their Power is"
"much more extended; for no Sentence"
"can stand that is not confirmed by Two"
"Thirds of this Council. Besides, that"
"no Son can be admitted into it during"
"the Life of his Father, nor Two be in it of"
"the same Family, nor any enter but by lection."
"The chief Officers of the Com-mon-wealth"
"are the Two Capitaneos, who"
"have such a Power as the old Roman Con-suls"
"had, but are chosen every Six Months."
"I talked with some that had been Capi-taneos"
"Six or Seven times, though  the Office"
"is never to be continued to the same Per-sons"
"twice successively. The Third Of-ficer"
"is the Commissary, who judges in"
"all Civil and Criminal Matters. But be-cause"
"the many Alliances, Friendships,"
"and Intermarriages, as well as the Per-sonal"
"Feuds and Animosities that happen"
"among so small a People might obstruct"
"the Course of Justice, if one of their"
"own Number had the Distribution of it;"
"they have always a Foreigner for this Em-ploy,"
"whom they chuse for Three Years,"
"and maintain out of the Publick Stock."
"He must be a Doctor of Law, and a"
"Man of known Integrity. He is joined"
"in Commission with the Capitaneos, and"
"acts something like the Recorder of"
"London under the Lord Mayor. The"
"Common-wealth of Genoa was forced to"
"make use of a foreign Judge for many"
"Years, whilst their Republick was torn"
"into the Divisions of Guelphs and Gibe-lines."
"The Fourth Man in the State is"
"the Physician, who must likewise be a"
"Stranger, and is maintained by a publick"
"Salary. He is obliged to keep a Horse,"
"to visit the Sick, and to inspect all"
"Drugs that are imported. He must be"
"at least Thirty Five Years old, a Do-ctor"
"of the Faculty, and eminent for"
"his Religion and Honesty; that his Rash-ness"
"or Ignorance may not unpeople the"
"Common-wealth. And that they may"
"not suffer long under any bad Choice, he"
"is elected only for Three Years. The"
"present Physician is a very understand-ing"
"Man, and well read in our Country-men,"
"Harvey, Willis, Sydenham, &amp "
"He has been continued for some time"
"among 'em, and they say the Common-wealth"
"thrives under his Hands. Ano-ther"
"Person, who makes no ordinary Fi-gure"
"in the Republick, is the School-Master."
"I scarce met with any in the"
"Place that had not some Tincture of"
"Learning. I had the Perusal of a tin"
"               "
"Book in Folio, Entituled, Statuta Il-lustrissimae"
"Reipublicae Sancti Marini, Print-ed"
"at Rimini by Order of the Common-wealth."
"The Chapter on the publick"
"Ministers says, that when an Ambassa-dor"
"is dispatched from the Republick to"
"any Foreign State he shall be allowed,"
"out of the Treasury, to the Value of a"
"Shilling a Day. The People are esteemed"
"very honest and rigorous in the Execu-tion"
"of Justice, and seem to live more"
"happy and contented among their Rocks"
"and Snows, than others of the Italians"
"do in the pleasantest Vallies of the"
"World. Nothing indeed can be a"
"greater Instance of the natural Love"
"that Mankind has for Liberty, and of"
"their Aversion to an Arbitrary Govern-ment,"
"than such a Savage Mountain co-vered"
"with People, and the Campania of"
"Rome, which lyes in the same Country,"
"almost destitute of Inhabitants."

"               FROM Rimini to Loretto the"
"Towns of Note are Pesaro,"
"               Fano, Senigallia and Ancona."
"Fano received its Name from"
"the Fane or Temple of For-tune"
"that stood in it. One may still see"
"the Triumphal Arch erected there to"
"Augustus: It is indeed very much faced"
"by Time, but the Plan of it, as it"
"'stood entire with all its Inscriptions, is"
"neatly cut upon the Wall of a neigh-bouring"
"Building. In each of these"
"Towns is a beautiful Marble Fountain,"
"where the Water runs continually through "
"'several little Spouts, which looks very"
"refreshing in these hot Countries, and"
"gives a great Coolness to the Air about"
"them. That of Pesaro is handsomly signed."
"Ancona is much the most con-siderable"
"of these Towns. It stands on"
"a Promontory, and looks more beauti-ful"
"at a distance than when you are in"
"it. The Port was made by Trajan,"
"for which he has a Triumphal Arch rected"
"to him by the Sea-side. The"
"Marble of this Arch looks very white"
"and fresh, as being exposed to the Winds"
"and Salt Sea-Vapours, that by continu-ally"
"fretting it preseves it self from that"
"mouldy Colour, which others of the"
"'same Materials have contracted. though "
"the Italians and Voyage-Writers call"
"these of Rimini, Fano, and Ancona Tri-umphal"
"Arches, there was probably"
"'some Distinction made among the Ro-mans"
"between such Honorary Arches rected"
"to Emperors, and those that"
"were raised to them on the Account of"
"a Victory, which are properly Trium-phal"
"Arches. This at Ancona was an In-stance"
"of Gratitude to Trajan for the"
"Port he had made there, as the two thers"
"I have mentioned were probably"
"for some Reason of the same Nature."
"One may however observe the Wisdom"
"of the ancient Romans, who to encou-rage"
"their Emperors in their Inclina-tion"
"of doing good to their Coun-try,"
"gave the same Honours to the great"
"Actions of Peace, which turned to the"
"Me into Foreign Realms my Fate conveys,"
"               Through Nations fruitful of Immortal Lays,"
"               Where the soft Season and inviting Clime"

"Treasury are surprizingly great, and as"
"much surpassed my Expectation as other"
"Sights have generally fallen short of it."
"Silver can scarce find an Admission, and"
"Gold it self looks but poorly among such"
"an incredible number of precious Stones."
"There will be, in a few Ages more, the"
"Jewels of the greatest Value in Europe,"
"if the Devotion of its Princes continues"
"in its present Fervour. The last Offer-ing"
"was made by the Queen Dowager"
"of Poland, and cost her 18000 Crowns."
"Some have wondered that the Turk ne-ver"
"attacks this Treasury, since it lyes"
"'so near the Sea-shore, and is so weakly"
"guarded. But besides that he has at-tempted"
"it formerly with no Success, it"
"is certain the Venetians keep too watch-ful"
"an Eye over his Motions at present,"
"and would never suffer him to enter the"
"Adriatic. It would indeed be an easie"
"thing for a Christian Prince to surprize"
"it, who has Ships still passing to and fro"
"without Suspicion, especially if he had"
"a Party in the Town, disguised like Pil-grims,"
"to secure a Gate for him; for"
"there have been sometimes to the Num-ber"
"of 100000 in a Day time, as it is"
"generally reported. But  it is probable"
"the Veneration for the Holy House, and"
"the Horror of an Action that would be"
"resented by all the Catholick Princes of"
"Europe, will be as great a Security to the"
"Place as the strongest Fortification. It"
"is indeed an amazing thing to see such a"
"prodigious Quantity of Riches lye dead,"
"and untouched in the midst of so much"
"Poverty and Misery as reign on all sides"
"of 'em. There is no question, how-ever,"
"but the Pope would make use of"
"these Treasures in case of any great Cala-mity"
"that should endanger the Holy See;"
"as an unfortunate War with the Turk, or a"
"powerful League among the Protestants."
"For I can but look on those vast Heaps"
"of Wealth, that are amassed together in"
"'so many Religious Places of Italy, as the"
"hidden Reserves and Magazines of the"
"Church, that she would open on any"
"pressing Occasion for her last Defence"
"and Preservation. If these Riches were"
"all turned into current Coin, and em-ployed"
"in Commerce, they would make"
"Italy the most flourishing Country in"
"Europe. The Case of the Holy House"
"is nobly designed, and executed by the"
"great Masters of Italy, that flourished"
"about a hundred Years ago. The Sta-tues"
"of the Sibyls are very finely wrought,"
"each of 'em in a different Air and Po-sture,"
"as are likewise those of the Pro-phets"
"underneath 'em. The Roof of"
"the Treasury is painted with the same"
"kind of Device. There stands at the up-per"
"End of it a large Crucifix very much"
"esteemed, the Figure of our Saviour re-presents"
"him in his last Agonies of Death,"
"and amidst all the Ghastliness of the sage"
"has something in it very amiable."
"The Gates of the Church are said to be"
"of Corinthian Brass, with many Scripture"
"Stories rising on 'em in Basso Relievo."
"The Pope Statue, and the Fountain"
"by it, would make a noble Show in a"
"Place less beautified with so many other"
"Productions of Art. The Spicery, the"
"Cellar and its Furniture, the great Re-venues"
"of the Convent, with the Story"
"of the Holy House, are too well known"
"to be here insisted upon."
"            Whoever were the first Inventors of"
"this Imposture, they seem to have taken"
"the hint of it from the Veneration that"
"the old Romans paid to the Cottage of"
"Romulus, which stood on Mount Capitol,"
"and was repaired from time to time as"
"it fell to decay. Virgil has given a pret-ty"

"            "
"               UPON my Arrival at Rome"
"I took a View of St. Peters,"
"and the Rotunda, leaving"
"the rest 'till my Return from"
"Naples, when I should have"
"time and leisure enough to consider"
"what I saw. St. Peters seldom answers"
"Expectation at first entering it, but en-larges"
"it self on all Sides insensibly, and"
"mends upon the Eye every Moment."
"The Proportions are so very well observed,"
"that nothing appears to an Advantage,"
"or distinguishes it self above the rest. It"
"'seems neither extreamly high, nor long,"
"nor broad, because it is all of them in a"
"just Equality. As on the contrary in"
"our Gothic Cathedrals, the Narrowness"
"of the Arch makes it rise in Height, or"
"run out in Length; the Lowness often"
"opens it in Breadth, or the Defectiveness"
"of some other Particular makes any single"
"Part appear in greater Perfection. though "
"every thing in this Church is admirable,"
"the most astonishing Part of it is the"
"Cupola. Upon my going to the Top"
"of it, I was surprized to find that the"
"Dome, which we see in the Church, is"
"not the same that one looks upon with-out"
"Doors, the last of 'em being a kind"
"of Case to the other, and the Stairs lying"
"betwixt 'em both, by which one as-cends"
"into the Ball. Had there been"
"only the outward Dome, it would not"
"have shewn it self to an Advantage to"
"those that are in the Church; or had"
"there only been the inward one, it would"
"'scarce have been seen by those that are"
"without; had they both been one solid"
"Dome of so great a Thickness, the Pil-lars"
"would have been too weak to have"
"'supported it. after having surveyed this"
"Dome, I went to see the Rotunda, which"
"is generally said to have been the Mo-del"
"of it. This Church is at present so"
"much changed from the ancient Panthe-on,"
"as Pliny has described it, that some"
"have been inclined to think it is not the"
"'same Temple; but the Cavalier Fonta-na"
"               "
"has abundantly satisfyed the World in"
"this Particular, and shewn how the an-cient"
"Figure, and Ornaments of the Pan-theon,"
"have been changed into what they"
"are at present. This Author, who is"
"now esteemed the best of the Roman"
"Architects, has lately written a Treatise"
"on Vespasian Amphitheater, which is"
"not yet Printed."
"            After having seen these Two Ma-ster-pieces"
"of Modern and Ancient Ar-chitecture,"
"I have often considered with"
"my self whether the ordinary Figure"
"of the Heathen, or that of the Christian"
"Temples be the most beautiful, and the"
"most capable of Magnificence, and can't"
"forbear thinking the Cross Figure more"
"proper for such spacious Buildings than"
"the Rotund. I must confess the Eye is"
"better filled at first entering the Rotund,"
"and takes in the whole Beauty and Mag-nificence"
"of the Temple at one view."
"But such as are built in the Form of a"
"Cross, give us a greater Variety of No-ble"
"Prospects. Nor is it easie to conceive"
"a more glorious Show in Architecture,"
"than what a Man meets with in St. Pe-ters,"
"when he stands under the Dome."
"If he looks upward he is astonished at"
"the spacious Hollow of the Cupola, and"
"has a Vault on every side of him, that"
"makes one of the beautifullest Vistas"
"that the Eye can possibly pass through . I"
"know that such as are professed Admirers"
"of the Ancients will find abundance"
"of Chimerical Beauties, the Archi-tects"
"themselves never thought of, as"
"one of the most Famous of the Moderns"
"in that Art tells us, the Hole in the"
"Roof of the Rotunda is so admirably con-trived,"
"that it makes those who are in"
"the Temple look like Angels, by dif-fusing"
"the Light equally on all sides"
"of 'em."
"            In all the old High-ways, that lead"
"from Rome, one sees several little Ruins"
"on each side of 'em, that were formerly"
"'so many Sepulchres; for the ancient Ro-mans"
"generally buryed their Dead near"
"the great Roads."

"be seen only in Churches, or Church-Yards,"
"begin often with a Siste Viator-Viator"

"Imitation of the old Roman Inscriptions,"
"that generally addressed themselves to the"
"Travellers; as it was impossible for 'em"
"to enter the City, or to go out of it"
"without passing through  one of these me-lancholly"
"Roads, which for a great Length"
"was nothing else but a Street of Fune-ral"
"Monuments."
"            In my way from Rome to Naples I"
"found nothing so remarkable as the"
"Beauty of the Country, and the extream"
"Poverty of its Inhabitants. It is indeed"
"an amazing thing to see the present solation"
"of Italy, when one considers"
"what incredible Multitudes of People"
"it abounded with during the Reigns of"
"the Roman Emperors: And notwithstand-ing"
"the Removal of the Imperial Seat,"
"the Irruptions of the Barbarous Nations,"
"the Civil Wars of this Country, with"
"the Hardships of its several Govern-ments,"
"one can scarce imagine how so"
"plentiful a Soil should become so mise-rably"
"unpeopled in Comparison of what"
"it once was. We may reckon, by a"
"very moderate Computation, more In-habitants"
"in the Campania of Old Rome,"
"than are now in all Italy. And if we"
"could number up those prodigious Swarms"
"that had settled themselves in every Part"
"of this delighful Country, I question"
"not but that they would amount to more"
"than can be found, at present, in any Six"
"Parts of Europe of the same Extent."
"This Desolation appears no where greater"
"than in the Pope Territories, and yet"
"there are several Reasons would make"
"a Man expect to see these Domini-ons"
"the best regulated, and most flou-rishing"
"of any other in Europe. Their"
"Prince is generally a Man of Learning"
"and Virtue, mature in Years and Expe-rience,"
"who has seldom any Vanity or"
"Pleasure to gratify at his People Ex-pence,"
"and is neither encumbered with"
"Wife, Children or Mistresses; not to"
"mention the supposed Sanctity of his"
"Character, which obliges him in a more"
"particular manner to consult the Good"
"and Happiness of Mankind. The Di-rection"
"of Church and State are"
"lodged entirely in his own Hands, so"
"that his Government is naturally free"
"from those Principles of Faction and Di-vision"
"which are mixed in the very"
"Composition of most others. His Sub-jects"
"are always ready to fall in with his"
"Designs, and are more at his Disposal"
"than any others of the most absolute"
"Government, as they have a greater Ve-neration"
"for his Person, and not only"
"court his Favour but his Blessing. His"
"Country is extreamly fruitful, and has"
"good Havens both for the Adriatic and"
"Mediterranean, which is an Advantage"
"peculiar to himself and the Neapolitans"
"above the rest of the Italians. There is"
"'still a Benefit the Pope enjoys above all"
"other Soveraigns, in drawing great Sums"
"out of Spain, Germany and other Coun-tries"
"that belong to Foreign Princes,"
"which one would fancy might be no"
"'small Ease to his own Subjects. We"
"may here add, that there is no Place in"
"Europe so much frequented by Strangers,"
"whether they are such as come out of"
"Curiosity, or such who are obliged to"
"attend the Court of Rome on several Oc-casions,"
"as are many of the Cardinals and"
"Prelates, that bring considerable Sums"
"into the Pope Dominions. But not-withstanding"
"all these promising Cir-cumstances,"
"and the long Peace that"
"has reigned so many years in Italy, there"
"is not a more miserable People in Europe"
"than the Pope Subjects. His State is"
"thin of Inhabitants, and a great Part of"
"his Soil uncultivated. His Subjects are"
"wretchedly poor and idle, and have nei-ther"
"'sufficient Manufactures nor Traffick"
"to employ 'em. These ill Effects may"
"arise, in a great measure, out of the Ar-bitrariness"
"of the Government, but I"
"think they are chiefly to be ascribed to"
"the very Genius of the Roman Catholick"
"Where Western Gales eternally reside,"
"               And all the Seasons lavish all their Pride,"
"               Blossoms, and Fruits, and Flowers together rise,"

"more agreeable than ordinary, that is"
"not covered with a Convent. The Cu-pola's"
"of this City, though  there are many"
"of them, don appear to the best vantage"
"when one surveys them at a di-stance,"
"as being generally too high and"
"narrow. The Marquis of Medina Cido-nia,"
"in his Vice-Royalty, made the Shell"
"of a House, which he had not time to"
"finish, that commands a View of the"

"one that I ever saw. It lyes in al-most"

"Miles in the Diameter. Three Parts of"

"Woods and Mountains. The high Pro-montory"

"The excessive Height of its Rocks"
"'secures a great part of the Bay from"
"Winds and Waves, which enter again"
"between the other End of this Island"
"and the Promontory of Miseno. The"
"Bay of Naples is called the Crater by the"
"old Geographers, probably from this its"

"in their present Establishment; though "
"there is no question but the King of"
"Spain will Reform most of these Abu-ses,"
"by breaking or retrenching the Pow-er"
"of the Barons, by cancelling several"
"unnecessary Employs, or by ransoming or"
"taking the Gabels into his own Hands. I"
"have been told too, there is a Law of"
"Charles the Fifth something like our Sta-tute"
"of Mort-main, which has laid dormant"
"ever since his Time, and will probably"
"have new Life put into it under the"
"Reign of an active Prince. The Inha-bitants"
"of Naples have been always very"
"notorious for leading a Life of Laziness"
"and Pleasure, which I take to arise part-ly"

"Scene of Antiquities. What"
"they call Virgil Tomb is"
"the first that one meets with"
"on the Way thither. It is certain this Poet"
"was buryed at Naples, but I think it is al-most"
"as certain that his Tomb stood on the"
"other side of the Town which looks to-wards"
"Vesuvio. By this Tomb is the"
"Entry into the Grotto of Pausilypo."
"The common People of Naples believe"
"it to have been wrought by Magick, and"

"is in greater Repute among the Neapo-litans"

"            If a Man would form to himself a just"
"Idea of this Place, he must fancy a vast"
"Rock undermined from one End to the"
"other, and a Highway running through  it,"
"near as long and as broad as the Mall in"
"St. James Park. This Subterraneous"
"Passage is much mended since Seneca"
"gave so bad a Character of it. The En-try"
"at both Ends is higher than the mid-dle"
"Parts of it, and sinks by degrees, to"
"fling in more Light upon the rest. To-wards"
"the middle are Two large Fun-nels,"
"bored through  the Roof of the Grot-to,"
"to let in Light and fresh Air."
"            There are no where about the Moun-tain"
"any vast Heaps of Stones, though  it is"
"certain the great Quantities of 'em that"
"are dug out of the Rock could not easi-ly"
"conceal themselves, had they not pro-bably"
"been consumed in the Moles and"
"Buildings of Naples. This confirmed me"
"in a Conjecture which I made at the"
"first sight of this Subterraneous Passage,"
"that it was not at first designed so much for"
"a High-way as for a Quarry of Stone, but"
"that the Inhabitants, finding a double vantage"
"by it, hewed it into the Form we"
"now see. Perhaps the same Design gave"

"Person, a Member of one of the Ger-man"
"Universities. He had stayed a Day"
"or Two in the Town longer than ordi-nary,"
"to take the Measures of several"
"empty Spaces that had been cut in the"
"Sides of a neighbouring Mountain."
"Some of 'em were supported with Pil-lars"
"formed out of the Rock, some were"
"made in the Fashion of Galleries, and"
"'some not unlike Amphitheaters. The"
"Gentleman had made to himself several"
"ingenious Hypotheses concerning the"
"use of these Subterraneous Apartments,"
"and from thenee collected the vast mag-nificence"
"and Luxury of the ancient"

"must confess, after having surveyed the"
"Antiquities about Naples and Rome, I"
"cannot but think that our Admiration of"
"'em does not so much arise out of their"
"Greatness as Uncommonness."

"            The Natural Curiosities about Naples"
"are as numerous and extraordinary as the"
"Artificial. I shall set them down, as I"
"have done the other, without any re-gard"
"to their Situation. The Grotto"
"del Cani is famous for the poisonous"
"Steams which float within a Foot of its"
"Surface. The Sides of the Grotto are"
"marked with Green, as high as the Ma-lignity"
"of the Vapour reaches. The com-mon"
"Experiments are as follow: A Dog,"
"that has his Nose held in the Vapour,"
"loses all Signs of Life in a very little"
"time; but if carryed into the open Air,"
"or thrown into a Neighbouring Lake,"
"he immediately recovers, if he is not"
"quite gone. A Torch, Snuff and all,"
"goes out in a Moment when dipped in-to"
"the Vapour. A Pistol cannot take Fire"
"in it. I split a Reed, and laid in the"
"Channel of it a Train of Gun-powder,"
"'so that one End of the Reed was above"
"the Vapour, and the other at the Bot-tom"
"of it; and I found, though  the Steam"
"was strong enough to hinder a Pistol"
"from taking Fire in it, and to quench a"
"lighted Torch, that it could not inter-cept"
"the Train of Fire when it had once"
"begun Flashing, nor hinder it from run-ning"
"to the very End. This Experiment"
"I repeated twice or thrice, to see if I"
"could quite dissipate the Vapour, which"
"I did in so great a measure, that one"
"might easily let off a Pistol in it. I ob-served"
"how long a Dog was in Expiring"
"the first time, and after his Recovery,"
"and found no sensible difference. A per"
"bore it Nine Minutes the first time"
"we put it in, and Ten the Second. When"
"we brought it out after the first Trial,"
"it took such a vast quantity of Air into"
"its Lungs, that it swelled almost twice"
"as big as before; and it was perhaps on"
"this Stock of Air that it lived a Minute"
"longer the second time. Doctor Connor"
"made a Discourse in one of the Acade-mies"
"at Rome upon the Subject of this"
"Grotto, which he has since Printed in"
"England. He attributes the Death of A-nimals,"
"and the Extinction of Lights, to"
"a great Rarefaction of the Air, caused"
"by the Heat and Eruption of the Steams."
"But how is it possible for these Steams,"
"tho' in never so great quantity, to resist"
"the Pressure of the whole Atmosphere?"
"And as for the Heat, it is but very in-considerable."
"However, to satisfie my"
"'self, I placed a thin Viol, well stopped"
"up with Wax, within the Smoak of"
"the Vapour, which would certainly have"
"burst in an Air rarefyed enough to kill"
"a Dog, or quench a Torch, but nothing"
"followed upon it. However, to take a-way"
"all further Doubt, I borrowed a"
"Weather-glass, and so fixed it in the"
"Grotto, that the Stagnum was wholly"
"covered with the Vapour, but I could"
"not perceive the Quicksilver sunk after"
"half an Hour standing in it. This Va-pour"
"is generally supposed to be Sul-phureous,"
"tho' I can see no Reason for"
"'such a Supposition. He that dips his"
"Hand in it finds no Smell that it leaves"
"upon it; and though  I put a whole Bun-dle"
"of lighted Brimstone Matches to the"
"Smoak, they all went out in an Instant,"
"as if immersed in Water. Whatever is"
"the Composition of the Vapour, let it"
"have but one Quality of being very"
"Glewy or Viscous, and I believe it will"
"mechanicaly solve all the Phaenomena"
"of the Grotto. It Unctuousness will"
"make it heavy, and unfit for mounting"
"higher than it does, unless the Heat of"
"the Earth, which is just strong enough"
"to agitate, and bear it up at a little di-stance"
"from the Surface, were much grea-ter"
"than it is to rarifie and scatter it. It"
"will be too gross and thick to keep the"
"Lungs in play for any time, so that A-nimals"
"will die in it sooner or later, as"
"their Blood Circulates slower or faster."
"Fire will live in it no longer than in"
"Water, because it wraps it self in the"
"'same manner about the Flame, and by"
"its Continuity hinders any quantity of"
"Air or Nitre from coming to its Suc-cour."
"The Parts of it however are not"
"'so compact as those of Liquors, nor"
"therefore tenacious enough to intercept"
"the Fire that has once caught a Train"
"of Gun-Powder, for which Reason they"
"may be quite broken and dispersed by the"
"Repetition of this Experiment. There"
"is an unctuous clammy Vapour that a-rises"

"Mountain. I must confess the Idea I"
"had of it, did not answer the real Image"
"of the Place when I came to see it; I"
"'shall therefore give the Description of"
"it as it then lay."
"            This Mountain stands at about Six"
"English Miles distance from Naples, though "
"by reason of its Height, it seems much"
"nearer to those that survey it from the"
"Town. In our Way to it we passed by"
"what was one of those Rivers of burn-ing"
"Matter, that ran from it in a late ruption."
"This looks at a distance like a"
"new plowed Land, but, as you come"
"near it you see nothing but a long Heap"
"of heavy disjointed Clods lying one up-on"
"another. There are innumerable Ca-vities"
"and Interstices among the several"
"Pieces, so that the Surface is all broken"
"and irregular. Sometimes a great Frag-ment"
"'stands like a Rock above the rest,"
"'sometimes the whole Heap lyes in a"
"kind of Channel, and in other Places"
"has nothing like Banks to confine it,"
"but rises Four or Five Foot high in the"
"open Air, without spreading abroad on"
"either side. This, I think, is a plain"
"Demonstration that these Rivers were"
"not as they are usually represented, so"
"many Streams of running Matter; for"
"how could a Liquid, that lay hardening"
"by degrees, settle in such a furrowed un-compact"
"Surface? Were the River a"
"Confusion of never so many different"
"Bodies, if they had been all actually dis-solved,"
"they would at least have formed"
"one continued Crust, as we see the Sco-rium"
"of Metals always gathers into a so-lid"
"Piece, let it be compounded of a Thou-sand"
"Heterogeneous Parts. I am apt to"
"think therefore, that these huge unwieledy"
"Lumps that now lye one upon another,"
"as if thrown together by Accident, re-mained"
"in the melted Matter rigid and"
"unliquifyed, floating in it like Cakes of"
"Ice in a River, and that, as the Fire and"
"Ferment gradually abated, they adjusted"
"themseves together as well as their irre-gular"
"Figures would permit, and by this"
"means fell into such an interrupted dis-orderly"
"Heap, as we now find it. What"
"was the melted Matter lyes at the Bot-tom"
"out of sight. After having quitted"
"the Side of this long Heap, which was"
"once a Stream of Fire, we came to the"
"Roots of the Mountain, and had a very"
"troublesome March to gain the Top of"
"it. It is covered on all Sides with a kind"
"of burnt Earth, very dry, and crumbled"
"into Powder, as if it had been artifici-ally"
"'sifted. It is very hot under the Feet,"
"and mixed with several burnt Stones and"
"Cakes of Cinders, which have been"
"thrown out at different times. A Man"
"'sinks almost a Foot in the Earth, and"
"generally loses half a Step by sliding"
"backwards. When we had climbed this"
"Mountain we discovered the Top of it"
"to be a wide naked Plain, smoaking with"
"Sulphur in several Places, and probably"
"undermined with Fire, for we conclu-ded"
"it to be hollow by the Sound it"
"made under our Feet. In the midst of"
"this Plain stands a high Hill in the shape"
"of a Sugar-loaf, so very steep that there"
"would be no mounting or descending it,"
"were not it made up of such a loose"
"crumbled Earth as I have before descri-bed."
"The Air of this Place must be"
"very much impregnated with Salt-peter,"
"as appears by the Specks of it on the"
"Sides of the Mountain, where one can"
"'scarce find a Stone that has not the Top"
"white with it. After we had, with"
"much ado, conquered this Hill, we saw"
"in the midst of it the present Mouth of"
"Vesuvio, that goes shelving down on all"
"Sides 'till above a Hundred Yards deep,"
"as near as we could guess, and has about"
"Three or Four Hundred in the Diame-ter,"
"for it seems a perfect Round. This"
"vast Hollow is generally filled with"
"Smoak, but, by the Advantage of a"
"Wind that blew for us, we had a very"
"clear and distinct sight of it. The Sides"
"appear all over stained with Mixtures of"
"White, Green, Red and Yellow, and"
"have several Rocks standing out of"
"them that look like pure Brimstone."
"The Bottom was entirely covered, and"
"tho' we looked very narrowly we could"
"'see nothing like a Hole in it; the Smoak"
"breaking through several imperceptible"
"Cracks in many Places. The very Mid-dle"
"was firm Ground when we saw it,"
"as we concluded from the Stones we"
"flung upon it, and I question not but"
"one might then have crossed the Bottom,"
"and have gone up on the other Side of"
"it with very little Danger, unless from"
"'some accidental Breath of Wind. In"
"the late Eruptions this great Hollow"
"was like a vast Caldron filled with"
"glowing and melted Matter, which, as"
"it boiled over in any Part, ran down the"
"Sides of the Mountain, and made Five"
"'such Rivers as that before-mentioned."
"In proportion as the Heat slackened, this"
"burning Matter must have subsided with-in"
"the Bowels of the Mountain, and as"
"it sunk very leisurely had time to Cake"
"together, and form the Bottom which"
"covers the Mouth of that dreadful Vault"
"that lyes underneath it. The next ruption"
"or Earthquake will probably"
"break in Pieces this false Bottom, and"
"quite change the present Face of"
"Things."
"            This whole Mountain, shaped like a"
"Sugar-loaf, has been made at several"
"times, by the prodigious Quantities of"
"Earth and Cinders, which have been"
"flung up out of the Mouth that lyes in"
"the midst of them, so that it encreases in"

"manner of furnishing the Town with"
"Snow, which they here use instead of"
"Ice, because, as they say, it cools or"
"congeals any Liquor sooner. There is"

"for they drink very few Liquors, not"
"'so much as Water, that have not lain"
"in Fresco, and every Body, from the"
"highest to the lowest, makes use of it;"
"insomuch that a Scarcity of Snow would"
"raise a Mutiny at Naples, as much as a"

"Country. To prevent this the King"
"has sold the Monopoly of it to certain"
"Persons, who are obliged to furnish the"
"City with it all the Year at so much"

"at about Eighteen Miles from the"
"Town, which has several Pits dug into"
"it. Here they employ many poor Peo-ple"
"at such a Season of the Year to roll"
"in vast Balls of Snow, which they ram"
"together, and cover from the Sun-shine."
"Out of these Reservoirs of Snow they"
"cut several Lumps, as they have occasi-on"
"for them, and send them on Asses to"
"the Sea-side, where they are carryed off"
"in Boats, and distributed to several Shops"
"at a settled Price, that from time to time"
"'supply the whole City of Naples. While"
"the Banditti continued their Disorders"
"in this Kingdom, they often put the"
"Snow-Merchants under Contribution,"

"            THE"
"ISLE of CAPREA."
"            "
"               HAving stayed longer at Naples"
"than I at first designed, I could"
"not dispense with my self from"
"making a little Voyage to"
"the Isle of Caprea, as being"
"very desirous to see a Place which had"
"been the Retirement of Augustus for"
"'some time, and the Residence of Tiberi-us"
"for several Years. The Island lyes"
"Four Miles in Length from East to West,"
"and about one in Breadth. The Western"
"Part, for about Two Miles in Length,"
"is a continued Rock vastly high, and in-accessible"
"on the Sea-side. It has how-ever"
"the greatest Town in the Island,"
"that goes under the Name of Ano-Ca-prea,"
"and is in several Places covered with"
"a very fruitful Soil. The Eastern End"
"of the Isle rises up in Precipices very"
"near as high, though  not quite so long,"
"as the Western. Between these Eastern"
"and Western Mountains lyes a Slip of"
"lower Ground, which runs across the"
"Island, and is one of the pleasantest Spots"
"I have seen. It is hid with Vines,"
"Figs, Oranges, Almonds, Olives, Myr-tles,"
"and Fields of Corn, which look"
"extremely fresh and beautiful, and make"
"up the most delightful: little Landskip"
"imaginable, when they are surveyed from"
"the Tops of the neighbouring Moun-tains."
"Here stands the Town of Caprea,"
"the Bishop Palace, and Two or Three"
"Convents. In the midst of this fruitful"
"Tract of Land rises a Hill, that was"
"probably covered with Buildings in Ti-berius's"
"Time. There are still several"
"Ruins on the Sides of it, and about the"
"Top are found Two or Three dark Gal-leries"
"low built, and covered with Ma-son's"
"Work, though  at present they appear"
"over-grown with Grass. I entered one"
"of 'em that is a Hundred Paces in Length."
"I observed, as some of the Countrymen"
"were digging into the Sides of this"
"Mountain, that what I took for solid"
"Earth was only Heaps of Brick, Stone,"
"and other Rubbish, skinned over with a"
"Covering of Vegetables. But the most"
"considerable Ruin is that which stands"
"on the very Extremity of the Eastern"
"Promontory, where are still some Apart-ments"
"left, very high and arched at Top."
"I have not indeed seen the Remains of"
"any ancient Roman Buildings, that have"
"not been Roofed with either Vaults or"
"Arches. The Rooms I am mentioning"
"'stand deep in the Earth, and have no-thing"
"like Windows or Chimnies, which"
"makes me think they were formerly ei-ther"
"Bathing Places or Reservoirs of"
"Water. An old Hermit lives at present"
"among the Ruins of this Palace, who"
"lost his Companion a few Years ago by"
"a Fall from the Precipice. He told me"
"they had often found Medals and Pipes"
"of Lead, as they dug among the Rub-bish,"
"and that not many Years ago they"
"discovered a paved Road running under"
"Ground, from the Top of the Moun-tain"
"to the Sea-side, which was after-wards"
"confirmed to me by a Gentleman"
"of the Island. There is a very noble"
"Prospect from this Place. On the one"
"'side lyes a vast Extent of Seas, that runs"
"abroad further than the Eye can reach."
"Just opposite stands the Green Promon-tory"
"of Surrentum, and on the other side"
"the whole Circuit of the Bay of Naples."
"This Prospect, according to Tacitus,"
"was more agreeable before the burning"
"of Vesuvio; that Mountain probably,"
"which after the first Eruption looked"
"like a great Pile of Ashes, was in Tibe-rius's"
"Time shaded with Woods and Vine-yards;"
"for I think Martial Epigram"
"may here serve as a Comment to Taci-tus."

"Port. On the North End of the"
"Island stands the Town and Castle, on"

"confound his Enemies, so that each of"
"the Goddesses has her Task assigned in"
"the Poet Prayer; and we may observe"
"the Invocation is divided between the"
"Two Deities, the first Line relating in-differently"
"to either. That which I have"

"            ROME."
"            "
"               IT is generally observed, that"
"Modern Rome stands higher"
"than the Ancient; some have"
"computed it about Fourteen"
"or Fifteen Feet, taking one"
"Place with another. The Reason given"
"for it is, that the present City stands up-on"
"the Ruins of the former, and indeed"
"I have often observed, that where any"
"considerable Pile of Building stood an-ciently"
"one still finds a rising Ground,"
"or a little kind of Hill, which was doubt-less"
"made up out of the Fragments and"
"Rubbish of the ruined Edifice. But be-sides"
"this particular Cause, we may assign"
"another that has very much contributed"
"to the raising the Situation of several"
"Parts of Rome: It being certain the great"
"Quantities of Earth, that have been"
"washed off from the Hills by the Vio-lence"
"of Showers, have had no small"
"'share in it. This any one may be sensi-ble"
"of who observes how far several"
"Buildings, that stand near the Roots of"
"Mountains, are sunk deeper in the Earth"
"than those that have been on the Tops"
"of Hills, or in open Plains; for which"
"Reason the present Face of Rome is much"
"more Even and Level than it was for-merly;"
"the same Cause that has raised"
"the lower Grounds having contributed"
"to sink those that were higher."
"            There are in Rome Two Setts of"
"Antiquities, the Christian and the Hea-then."
"The former, though  of a fresher"
"Date, are so embroiled with Fable and"
"Legend, that one receives but little Sa-tisfaction"
"from searching into them. The"
"other give a great deal of Pleasure to"
"'such as have met with them before in"
"ancient Authors; for a Man who is in"
"Rome can scarce see an Object that does"
"not call to Mind a Piece of a Latin Po-et"
"or Historian. Among the Remains"
"of Old Rome, the Grandeur of the Com-mon-wealth"
"'shows it self chiefly in Works"
"that were either necessary or convenient,"
"'such as Temples, High-ways, Aqueducts,"
"Walls and Bridges of the City. On"
"the contrary the Magnificence of Rome,"
"under the Emperors, is seen principally"
"in such Works as were rather for stentation"
"or Luxury, than any real Use-fulness"
"or Necessity, as in Baths, Am-phitheaters,"
"Circus  Obelisks, Trium-phant"
"Pillars, Arches and Mausoleums;"
"for what they added to the Aqueducts"
"was rather to supply their Baths and Nau-machias,"
"and to embellish the City with"
"Fountains, than out of any real Necessi-ty"
"there was for them. These several"
"Remains have been so copiously described"
"by abundance of Travellers, and other"
"Writers, particularly by those concerned"
"in the learned Collection of Graevius, that"
"it is very difficult to make any new Dis-coveries"
"on so beaten a Subject. There"
"is however so much to be observed in so"
"'spacious a Field of Antiquities, that it"
"is almost impossible to survey them with-out"
"taking new Hints, and raising diffe-rent"
"Reflections, according as a Mans na-tural"
"Turn of Thoughts, or the Course"
"of his Studies, direct him."
"            No Part of the Antiquities of Rome"
"pleased me so much as the ancient Sta-tues,"
"of which there is still an incredi-ble"
"Variety. The Workmanship is of-ten"
"the most exquisite of any thing in"
"its kind. A Man would wonder how"
"it were possible for so much Life to en-ter"
"into Marble, as may be discovered in"
"'some of the best of them; and even in"
"the meanest one has the Satisfaction of"
"'seeing the Faces, Postures, Airs and"
"Dress of those that have lived so many"
"Ages before us. There is a strange Re-semblance"
"between the Figures of the"
"'several Heathen Deities, and the Descri-ptions"
"that the Latin Poets have given"
"us of them; but as the first may be look-ed"
"upon as the ancienter of the Two, I"
"question not but the Roman Poets were"
"the Copiers of the Greek Statuaries."
"Tho' on other Occasions we often find"
"the Statuaries took their Subjects from"
"the Poets. The Laocoon is too known"
"an Instance among many others that are"
"to be met with at Rome. In the Villa"
"Aldabrandina are the Figures of an Old"
"and Young Man, engaged together at"
"the Caestus, who are probably the Dares"
"and Entellus of Virgil; where by the"
"way one may observe the Make of the"
"ancient Caestus, that it only consisted of"
"'so many large Thongs about the Hand,"
"without any thing like a Piece of Lead at"
"the End of them, as some Writers of"
"Antiquities have falsely imagined."
"            I question not but many Passages in"
"the old Poets hint at several Parts of"
"Sculpture, that were in Vogue in the"
"Author Time, though  they are now ne-ver"
"thought of, and that therefore such"
"Passages lose much of their Beauty in the"
"Eye of a Modern Reader, who does not"
"look upon them in the same Light with"
"the Author Contemporaries. I shall"
"only mention Two or Three out of Ju-venal,"
"that his Commentators have not"
"taken notice of. The first runs thus,"
"                  Multa pudicitiae veteris vestigia forsan,"

"Court of France. But the best of the"
"Furniture was at Rome, where the Prince"
"of Monaco resided at that time Ambassa-dor."
"We here took a little Boat to creep"
"along the Sea-shore as far as Genoa; but"
"at Savona, finding the Sea too rough,"
"we were forced to make the best of our"
"way by Land, over very rugged Moun-tains"
"and Precipices: For this Road is"
"much more difficult than that over"
"Mount Cennis."
"            "
"            The Genoese are esteemed extremely"
"Cunning, Industrious, and inured to"
"Hardship above the rest of the Italians;"
"which was likewise the Character of the"
"old Ligurians. And indeed it is no won-der,"
"while the Barrenness of their Coun-try"
"continues, that the Manners of the"
"Inhabitants do not change: Since there is"
"nothing makes Men sharper, and sets"
"their Hands and Wits more at work than"
"Want. The Italian Proverb says of the"
"Genoese, that they have a Sea without"
"Fish, Land without Trees, and Men"
"without Faith. The Character the"
"Latin Poets have given of them is not"
"much different."
"                  "
"future, but might often give a considera-rable"
"Light into the Quality of the Place,"
"or the Design of the Statue."
"            But the great Magazine for all kinds"
"of Treasure is supposed to be the Bed of"
"the Tiber. We may be sure, when the"
"Romans lay under the Apprehensions of"
"'seeing their City sacked by a barbarous"
"Enemy, as they have done more than"
"once, that they would take care to be-stow"
"'such of their Riches this way as"
"could best bear the Water: besides what"
"the Insolence of a Brutish Conqueror"
"may be supposed to have contributed, who"
"had an Ambition to waste and destroy all"
"the Beauties of so celebrated a City. I"
"need not mention the old Common-shore"
"of Rome, which ran from all Parts of"
"the Town with the Current and Vio-lence"
"of an ordinary River, nor the fre-quent"
"Inundations of the Tiber, which"
"may have swept away many of the Or-naments"
"of its Banks, nor the several"
"Statues that the Romans themselves flung"
"into it, when they would revenge them-selves"
"on the Memory of an ill Citizen,"
"a dead Tyrant, or a Discarded Favourite."
"At Rome they have so general an Opini-on"
"of the Riches of this River, that the"
"Jews have formerly proffered the Pope"
"to cleanse it, so they might have, for"
"their Pains, what they found in the Bo-some"
"of it. I have seen the Valley near"
"Ponte molle, which they proposed to fa-shion"
"into a new Channel for it, 'till they"
"had cleared the old for its Reception."
"The Pope however would not comply"
"with the Proposal, as fearing the Heats"
"might advance too far before they had"
"finished their Work, and produce a Pesti-lence"
"among his People; though  I don't"
"'see why such a Design might not be ex-ecuted"
"now with as little Danger as in"
"Augustus Time, were there as many"
"Hands employed upon it. The City of"
"Rome would receive a great Advantage"
"from the Undertaking, as it would raise"
"the Banks and deepen the Bed of the"
"Tiber, and by Consequence free 'em from"
"those frequent Inundations to which"
"they are so subject at present; for the"
"Channel of the River is observed to be"
"narrower within the Walls, than either"
"below or above them."
"            Before I quit this Subject of the Sta-tues,"
"I think it very observable, that a-mong"
"those which are already found there"
"'should be so many not only of the same"
"Persons, but made after the same Design."
"One would not indeed wonder to see se-veral"
"Figures of particular Deities and"
"Emperors, who had a Multitude of Tem-ples"
"erected to 'em, and had their seve-ral"
"Sets of Worshippers and Admirers."
"Thus Ceres, the most beneficent and"
"useful of the Heathen Divinities, has"
"more Statues than any other of the Gods"
"or Goddesses, as several of the Roman"
"Emperesses took a Pleasure to be re-presented"
"in her Dress. And I believe"
"one finds as many Figures of that excel-lent"
"Emperor Marcus Aurelius, as of all"
"the rest together; because the Romans"
"had so great a Veneration for his Memo-ry,"
"that it grew into a part of their Re-ligion"
"to preserve a Statue of him in al-most"
"every private Family. But how"
"comes it to pass, that so many of these"
"Statues are cut after the very same Mo-del,"
"and not only of these, but of such"
"as had no Relation, either to the Inte-rest"
"or Devotion of the Owner, as the"
"dying Cleopatra, the Narcissus, the Faune"
"leaning against the Trunk of a Tree, the"
"Boy with the Bird in his Hand, the Leda"
"and her Swan, with many others of the"
"'same Nature. I must confess I always"
"look upon Figures of this kind, as the"
"Copies of some celebrated Master-piece,"
"and question not but they were famous"
"Originals, that gave Rise to the several"
"Statues which we see with the same Air,"
"Posture, and Attitudes: What confirms"
"me in this Conjecture, there are many"
"ancient Statues of the Venus Medicis,"
"the Silenus with the young Bacchus in"
"his Arms, the Hercules Farnese, the An-tinöus,"
"and other beautiful Originals of"
"the Ancients, that are already drawn"
"out of the Rubbish, where they lay"
"concealed for so many Ages. Among"
"the rest I have observed more that are"
"formed after the Design of the Venus of"
"Medicis than of any other, from whence"
"I believe one may conclude, that it was the"
"most celebrated Statue among the Anci-ents,"
"as well as among the Moderns. It has"
"always been usual for Sculptors to work"
"upon the best Models, as it is for those that"
"are Curious to have Copies of them."
"            I am apt to think something of the"
"'same Account may be given of the"
"Resemblance that we meet with in many"
"of the Antique Basso Relievo  I re-member"
"I was very well pleased with"
"the Device of one that I met with on"
"the Tomb of a young Roman Lady,"
"which had beem made for her by her"
"Mother. The Sculptor had chosen the"
"Rape of Proserpine for his Device, where"
"in one End you might see the God of"
"the Dead (Pluto) hurrying away a beau-tiful"
"young Virgin, (Proserpine) and at"
"the other the Grief and Distraction of"
"the Mother (Ceres) on that Occasion. I"
"have since observed the same Device up-on"
"'several Sarcophagi, that have enclosed"
"the Ashes of Men or Boys, Maids or"
"Matrons; for when the Thought took,"
"tho' at first it received its Rise from"
"'such a particular Occasion as I have"
"mentioned, the Ignorance of the Sculptors"
"applyed it promiscuously. I know there"
"are Authors who discover a Mystery in"
"this Device."
"            A Man is sometimes surprized to find"
"'so many extravagant Fancies as are cut"
"on the old Pagan Tombs. Masks, Hun-ting-matches,"
"and Bacchanals are very"
"common; sometimes one meets with a"
"lewd Figure of a Priapus, and in the"
"Villa Pamphilia is seen a Satyr coupling"
"with a Goat. There are however many"
"of a more serious Nature, that shadow"
"out the Existence of the Soul after"
"Death, and the Hopes of a happy Im-mortality."
"I cannot leave the Basso Relie-vo's"
"without mentioning one of 'em,"
"where the Thought is extreamly noble."
"It is called Homer Apotheosis, and con-sists"
"of a Groupe of Figures cut in the"
"'same Block of Marble, and rising one a-bove"
"another by Four or Five different"
"Ascents. Jupiter sits at the Top of it"
"with a Thunderbolt in his Hand, and,"
"in such a Majesty as Homer himself re-presents"
"him, presides over the Ceremony."
"                  "
"                     "
"                        "

"            "
"            Immediately beneath him are the Fi-gures"
"of the Nine Muses, supposed to"
"be celebrating the Praises of the Poet."
"Homer himself is placed at one End of"
"the lowest Row, sitting in a Chair of"
"State, which is supported on each Side"
"by the Figure of a kneeling Woman."
"The one holds a Sword in her Hand to"
"represent the Iliad, or Actions of Achil-les,"
"as the other has an Aplustre to repre-sent"
"the Odyssy, or Voyage of Ulysses."
"About the Poet Feet are creeping a"
"Couple of Mice, as an Emblem of the"
"Batracho-myomachia. Behind the Chair"
"'stands Time, and the Genius of the"
"Earth, distinguished by their proper At-tributes,"
"and putting a Garland on the"
"Poet Head, to intimate the mighty Re-putation"
"he has gained in all Ages, and"
"in all Nations of the World. Before"
"him stands an Altar with a Bull ready"
"to be Sacrificed to the new God, and"
"behind the Victim a Train of the several"
"Vertues that are represented in Homer's"
"Works, or to be learnt out of them,"
"lifting up their Hands in Admiration of"
"the Poet, and in Applause of the Solem-nity."
"This Antique Piece of Sculpture"
"is in the Possession of the Constable Co-lonna,"
"but never shown to those who see"
"the Palace, unless they particularly desire it."
"            Among the great Variety of ancient"
"Coins which I saw at Rome, I could not"
"but take particular notice of such as re-late"
"to any of the Buildings or Statues"
"that are still Extant. Those of the"
"First kind have been already publish-ed"
"by the Writers of the Roman An-tiquities,"
"and may be most of them"
"met with in the last Edition of Donatus,"
"as the Pillars of Trajan and Antonine, the"
"Arches of Drusus Germanicus, and Sep-timius"
"Severus, the Temples of Janus,"
"               Concord, Vesta, Jupiter tonans, Apollo"
"and Faustina, the Circus Maximus, Ago-nalis,"
"and that of Caracalla, or, accor-ding"
"to Fabretti, of Galienus, of Vespa-sian's"
"Amphitheater, and Alexander Se-verus's"
"Baths; though , I must confess, the"
"Subject of the last may be very well"
"doubted of. As for the Meta sudans"
"and Pons Aelius, which have gained a"
"Place among the Buildings that are now"
"'standing, and to be met with on old"
"Reverses of Medals: The Coin that"
"'shows the first is generally rejected as"
"'spurious: nor is the other, though  cited in the"
"last Edition of Monsieur Vaillant, esteemed"
"more Authentick by the present Roman"
"Medallists, who are certainly the most"
"'skilful in the World, as to the Mecha-nical"
"Part of this Science. I shall close"
"up this Set of Medals with a very Cu-rious"
"one, as large as a Medalion, that"
"is singular in its kind. On one Side is"
"the Head of the Emperor Trajan, the"
"Reverse has on it the Circus Maximus,"
"and a View of the Side of the Palatine"
"Mountain that faces it, on which are"
"'seen several Edifices, and among the rest"
"the famous Temple of Apollo, that has"
"'still a considerable Ruin standing. This"
"Medal I saw in the Hands of Monseig-neur"
"Strozzi, Brother to the Duke of"
"that Name, who has many Curiosities"
"in his Possession, and is very obliging to"
"a Stranger who desires the Sight of"
"'em. It is a surprising thing; that among"
"the great Pieces of Architecture repre-sented"
"on the old Coins, one can never"
"meet with the Pantheon, the Mausolaeum"
"of Augustus, Nero Golden House, the"
"Moles Adriani, the Septizonium of Seve-rus,"
"the Baths of Dioclesian, &amp  But"
"'since it was the Custom of the Roman"
"Emperors thus to Register their most"
"remarkable Buildings, as well as Actions,"
"and since there are several in either of"
"these kinds not to be found on Medals,"
"more extraordinary than those that are;"
"we may, I think, with great Reason"
"'suspect our Collections of old Coins to"
"be extremely deficient, and that those"
"which are already found out scarce bear"
"a Proportion to what are yet undisco-vered."
"A Man takes a great deal more"
"Pleasure in surveying the ancient Statues,"
"who compares them with Medals, than"
"it is possible for him to do without some"
"little Knowledge this way; for these"
"Two Arts illustrate each other; and as"
"there are several Particulars in History"
"and Antiquities which receive a great"
"Light from ancient Coins, so would it"
"be impossible to Decipher the Faces of"
"the many Statues that are to be seen at"
"Rome, without so Universal a Key to"
"them. It is this that teaches to distin-guish"
"the Kings and Consuls, Emperors"
"and Emperesses, the Deities and Virtues,"
"with a Thousand other Particulars re-lating"
"to Statuary, and not to be learnt"
"by any other Means. In the Villa Pam-philia"
"'stands the Statue of a Man in"
"Woman Cloaths, which the Anti-quaries"
"do not know what to make of,"
"and therefore pass it off for an Her-maphrodite;"
"But a learned Medallist"
"in Rome has lately fixed it to Clodius,"
"who is so famous for having intruded into"
"the S"
"                  ••"
"               emnities of the Bona Dea in a"
"Woman Habit, for one sees the same"
"Features and Make of Face in a Medal"
"of the Clodian Family."
"            I have seen on Coins the Four finest"
"Figures perhaps that are now Extant:"
"The Hercules Farnese, the Venus of Me-dicis,"
"the Apollo in the Belvidere, and"
"the famous Marcus Aurelius on Horse-back."
"The oldest Medal that the First"
"appears upon is one of Commodus, the"
"Second on one of Faustina, the Third"
"on one of Antoninus Pius, and the last"
"on one of Lucius Verus. We may con-clude,"
"I think, from hence, that these"
"Statues were extremely celebrated a-mong"
"the old Romans, or they would"
"never have been honoured with a Place"
"among the Emperor Coins. We may"
"further observe, that all Four of 'em"
"make their first Appearance in the An-tonine"
"Family, for which Reason I am apt"
"to think they are all of them the Pro-duct"
"of that Age. They would proba-bly"
"have been mentioned by Pliny the"
"Naturalist, who lived in the next Reign,"
"'save one, before Antoninus Pius, had they"
"been made in his Time. As for the"

"of this Age, though  I must confess it"
"may be doubted, whether the Medal I"
"have cited represents it. All I can say"
"for it is, that the Horse and Man on the"
"Medal are in the same Posture as they"
"are on the Statue, and that there is a"
"Resemblance of Marcus Aurelius Face,"
"for I have seen this Reverse on a Meda-lion"
"of Don Livio Cabinet, and much"
"more distinctly in another very beautiful"
"one, that is in the Hands of Signior Marc."
"Antonio. It is generally objected, that"
"Lucius Verus would rather have placed"
"the Figure of himself on Horseback up-on"
"the Reverse of his own Coin, than"
"the Figure of Marcus Aurelius. But it"
"is very well known that an Emperor"
"often stamped on his Coins the Face or"
"Ornaments of his Collegue, as an In-stance"
"of his Respect or Friendship for"
"him; and we may suppose Lucius Verus"
"would omit no Opportunity of doing"
"Honour to Marcus Aurelius, whom he"
"rather revered as his Father, than treat-ed"
"as his Partner in the Empire. The"
"Famous Antinous in the Belvidere must"
"have been made too about this Age, for"
"he dyed towards the middle of Adrian's"
"Reign, the immediate Predecessor of"
"               Antoninus Pius. This entire Figure,"
"tho' not to be found in Medals, may be"
"'seen in several precious Stones. Monsi-eur"
"La Chausse, the Author of the Mu-saeum"
"Romanum, showed me an Antinous"
"that he has published in his last Volume,"
"cut in a Cornelian, which he values at"
"Fifty Pistoles. It represents him in the"
"Habit of a Mercury, and is the finest In-taglia"
"that I ever saw."
"            Next to the Statues, there is nothing"
"in Rome more surprising than that a-mazing"
"variety of ancient Pillars of so"
"many kinds of Marble. As most of the"
"old Statues may be well supposed to have"
"been cheaper to their first Owners, than"
"they are to a Modern Purchaser, several"
"of the Pillars are certainly rated at a"
"much lower Price at present than they"
"were of old. For not to mention what"
"a huge Column of Granite, Serpentine,"
"or Porphyry must have cost in the Quar-ry,"
"or in its Carriage from Egypt to"
"Rome, we may only consider the great"
"Difficulty of hewing it into any Form,"
"and of giving it the due Turn, Propor-tion"
"and Polish. It is well known how"
"these sorts of Marble resist the Impres-sions"
"of such Instruments as are now in"
"use. There is indeed a Milanese at Rome"
"who works in them, but his Advances"
"are so very slow, that he scarce lives up-on"
"what he gains by it. He showed me"
"a Piece of Porphyry worked into an or-dinary"
"Salver, which had cost him Four"
"Months continual Application, before"
"he could bring it into that Form. The"
"Ancients had probably some Secret to"
"harden the Edges of their Tools, with-out"
"recurring to those Extravagant Opi-nions"
"of their having an Art to mollifie"
"the Stone, or that it was naturally softer"
"at its first cutting from the Rock, or"
"what is still more absurd, that it was an"
"artificial Composition, and not the na-tural"
"Product of Mines and Quarries."
"The most valuable Pillars about Rome,"
"for the Marble of which they are made,"
"are the Four Columns of Oriental Ja-sper"
"in St. Paulina Chappel at St. Ma-ria"
"Maggiore; Two of Oriental Gra-nite"
"in St. Pudenziana; One of Tran-sparent"
"Oriental Jasper in the Vatican"
"Library; Four of Nero-Bianco in St."
"Cecilia Trans-tevere; Two of Brocatel-lo,"
"and Two of Oriental Agate in Don"
"Livio Palace; Two of Giallo Antico in"
"St. John Lateran, and Two of Verdi"
"Antique in the Villa Pamphilia. These are"
"all entire and solid Pillars, and made of"
"'such kinds of Marble as are no where"
"to be found but among Antiquities, whe-ther"
"it be that the Veins of it are un-discovered,"
"or that they were quite ex-hausted"
"upon the ancient Buildings."
"Among these old Pillars I cannot forbear"
"reckoning a great Part of an Alablaster"
"Column, which was found in the Ruins"
"of Livia Portico. It is of the Colour"
"of Fire, and may be seen over the high"
"Altar of St. Maria in Campitello, for"
"they have cut it into Two Pieces, and"
"fixed it in the Shape of a Cross in a Hole"
"of the Wall that was made on purpose"
"to receive it; so that the Light passing"
"thro' it from without, makes it look,"
"to those who are in the Church, like a"
"huge transparent Cross of Amber. As"
"for the Workmanship of the old Roman"
"Pillars, Monsieur Desgodetz, in his ac-curate"
"Measures of these Ruins has ob-served,"
"that the Ancients have not kept"
"to the nicety of Proportion, and the"
"Rules of Art, so much as the Moderns"
"in this Particular. Some, to excuse this"
"Defect, lay the Blame of it on the Work-men"
"of Aegypt, and of other Nations,"
"who sent most of the ancient Pillars ready"
"'shaped to Rome: Others say that the An-cients,"
"knowing Architecture was chiefly"
"designed to please the Eye, only took"
"care to avoid such Disproportions as"
"were gross enough to be observed by the"
"Sight, without minding whether or no"
"they approached to a Mathematical Ex-actness:"
"Others will have it rather to be"
"an Effect of Art, and of what the Italians,"
"call the Gusto grande, than of any Negli-gence"
"in the Architect; for they say"
"the Ancients always considered the Situ-ation"
"of a Building, whether it were"
"high or low, in an open Square or in a"
"narrow Street, and more or less devia-ted"
"from their Rules of Art, to comply"
"with the several Distances and Elevations"
"from which their Works were to be re-garded."
"It is said there is an Ionic Pillar"
"in the Santa Maria Transtevere, where"
"the Marks of the Compass are still to be"
"'seen on the Volute, and that Palladio"
"learnt from hence the working of that"
"difficult Problem; but I never could find"
"time to examine all the old Columns"
"of that Church. Among the Pil-lars"
"I must not pass over the Two no-blest"
"in the World, those of Trajan and"
"Antonine. There could not have been"
"a more magnificent Design than that of"
"Trajan Pillar. Where could an Empe-ror's"
"Ashes have been so nobly lodged,"
"as in the midst of his Metropolis, and"
"on the Top of so exalted a Monument,"
"with the greatest of his Actions under-neath"
"him? Or, as some will have it,"
"his Statue was on the Top, his Urn at"
"the Foundation, and his Battles in the"
"midst. The Sculpture of it is too well"
"known to be here mentioned. The most"
"remarkable Piece in Antonine Pillar is the"
"Figure of Jupiter Pluvius, sending down"
"Rain on the fainting Army of Marcus"
"Aurelius, and Thunderbolts on his Ene-mies,"
"which is the greatest Confirma-tion"
"possible of the Story of the Christian"
"Legion, and will be a standing Evidence"
"for it, when any Passage in an old Au-thor"
"may be supposed to be forged. The"
"Figure that Jupiter here makes among"
"the Clouds, puts me in Mind of a Passage"
"in the Aeneid, which gives just such a-nother"
"Image of him. Virgil Inter-preters"
"are certainly to blame, that sup-pose"
"it is nothing but the Air which is"
"here meant by Jupiter."

"            The little Lake that gives Rise to this"
"River, with its floating Islands, is one"
"of the most extraordinary natural Curi-osities"
"about Rome. It lyes in the very"
"Flat of Campania, and as it is the Drain"
"of these Parts,  it is no Wonder that it"
"is so impregnated with Sulphur. It has"
"at Bottom so thick a Sediment of it,"
"that upon throwing in a Stone the Wa-ter"
"boils for a considerable time over the"
"Place which has been stirred up. At the"
"'same time are seen little Flakes of Scurfe"
"rising up, that are probably the Parts"
"which compose the Islands, for they of-ten"
"mount of themselves, though  the Wa-ter"
"is not troubled."
"            I question not but this Lake was for-merly"
"much larger than it is at present,"
"and that the Banks have grown over it"
"by degrees, in the same manner as the"
"Islands have been formed on it. Nor is"
"it improbable but that, in Process of"
"Time, the whole Surface of it may be"
"crusted over, as the Islands enlarge them-selves,"
"and the Banks close in upon them."
"All about the Lake, where the Ground"
"is dry, we found it to be hollow by the"
"Trampling of our Horses Feet. I could"
"not discover the least Traces of the Si-byls"
"Temple and Grove, which stood on"
"the Borders of this Lake. Tivoli is seen"
"at a distance lying along the Brow of"
"a Hill. Its Situation has given Horace"
"occasion to call it Tibur Supinum, as Vir-gil"
"perhaps for the same Reason entitles"
"it Superbum. The Villa Medicis with"
"its Water-Works, the Cascade of the"
"Teverone, and the Ruins of the Sibyls Tem-ple"
"(of which Vignola has made a little"
"Copy at Peters Montorio) are descri-bed"
"in every Itinerary. I must confess"
"I was most pleased with a beautiful Pro-spect"
"that none of them have mentio-ned,"
"which lyes at about a Mile di-stance"
"from the Town. It opens on one"
"Side into the Roman Campania, where"
"the Eye loses it self on a smooth spaci-ous"
"Plain. On the other Side is a more"
"broken and interrupted Scene, made up"
"of an infinite Variety of Inequalities and"
"Shadowings, that naturally arise from an"
"agreeable Mixture of Hills, Groves and"
"Vallies. But the most enlivening Part"
"of all is the River Teverone, which you"
"'see at about a Quarter of a Mile di-stance"
"throwing it self down a Preci-pice,"
"and falling by several Cascades from"
"one Rock to another, 'till it gains the"
"Bottom of the Valley, where the Sight"
"of it would be quite lost, did not it"
"'sometimes discover it self through  the Breaks"
"and Openings of the Woods that grow"
"about it. The Roman Painters often"
"work upon this Landskip, and I am apt"
"to believe that Horace had his Eye upon"
"it in those Two or Three beautiful Tou-ches"
"which he has given us of these Seats."
"The Teverone was formerly called the"
"Anio."

"            At Frescati I had the Satisfaction of"
"'seeing the First Sketch of Versailles in"
"the Walks and Water-Works. The"
"Prospect from it was doubtless much"
"more delightful formerly, when the Cam-pania"
"was set thick with Towns, Villas"
"and Plantations. Cicero Tusculum was"
"at a Place called Grotto Ferrate, about"
"Two Miles off this Town, though  most"
"of the Modern Writers have fixed it to"
"Frescati. Nardini says, there was found"
"among the Ruins at Grotto Ferrate a"
"Piece of Sculpture which Cicero himself"
"mentions in one of his familiar Epistles."
"In going to Frescati we had a fair View"

"            On our Way to Palaestrina we saw"
"the Lake Regillus, famous for the Ap-parition"
"of Castor and Pollux, who were"
"here seen to give their Horses Drink af-ter"
"the Battel between the Romans and"
"the Son-in-Law of Tarquin. At some"
"distance from it we had a View of the"
"Lacus Gabinus, that is much larger than"
"distance from Genoa, without any thing"
"of this Paint upon it, consists of a Doric"
"and Corinthian Row of Pillars, and is"
"much the handsomest of any I there saw."
"The Duke of Doria Palace has the best"
"Outside of any in Genoa, as that of Du-razzo"
"is the best furnished within. There"
"is one Room in the first, that is hung"
"with Tapestry, in which are wrought the"
"Figures of the great Persons, that the Fa-mily"
"has produced; as perhaps there is"
"no House in Europe, that can show a lon-ger"
"Line of Heroes, that have still acted"
"for the Good of their Country. Andrew"
"Doria has a Statue erected to him at the"
"Entrance of the Doge Palace, with the"
"glorious Title of Deliverer of the Com-mon-wealth;"
"and one of his Family ano-ther,"
"that calls him its Preserver. In the"
"Doge Palace, are the Rooms, where the"
"great and little Council with the Two"
"Colleges hold their Assemblies; but as"
"the State of Genoa is very poor, though  se-veral"
"of its Members are extreamly rich,"
"'so one may observe infinitely more Splen-dor"
"and Magnificence, in particular Per-sons"
"Houses, than in those that belong"
"to the Publick. But we find in most of"
"the States of Europe, that the People show"
"the greatest Marks of Poverty, where"
"the former. We left the Road for a-bout"
"half a Mile to see the Sources of"
"a Modern Aqueduct. It is entertaining"
"to observe how the several little Springs"
"and Rills, that break out of the Sides"
"of the Mountain, are gleaned up, and"
"conveyed through  little covered Channels"
"into the main Hollow of the Aqueduct."
"It was certainly very lucky for Rome,"
"'seeing it had occasion for so many A-queducts,"
"that there chanced to be such"
"a Range of Mountains within its Neigh-bourhood."
"For by this means they could"
"take up their Water from what height"
"they pleased, without the Expence of"
"'such an Engine as that of Marli. Thus"
"the Claudian Aqueduct ran Thirty Eight"
"Miles, and sunk after the Proportion"
"of Five Foot and a half every Mile, by"
"the Advantage only of a high Source"
"and the low Situation of Rome. Palae-strina"
"'stands very high, like most other"
"Towns in Italy, for the Advantage of"
"the cool Breezes, for which Reason Vir-gil"
"calls it Altum, and Horace, Frigidum"
"Praeneste. Statius calls it Praeneste Sa-crum,"
"because of the Famous Temple"
"of Fortune that stood in it. There are"
"'still great Pillars of Granite, and other"
"Fragments of this ancient Temple. But"
"the most considerable Remnant of it is"
"a very beautiful Mosaic Pavement, the"
"finest I have ever seen in Marble. The"
"Parts are so well joined together, that"
"the whole Piece looks like a continued"
"Picture. There are in it the Figures of"
"a Rhinoceros, of Elephants, and of se-veral"
"other Animals, with little Land-skips"
"which look very lively and well"
"painted, though  they are made out of the"
"natural Colours and Shadows of the"
"Marble. I do not remember ever to"
"have met with any old Roman Mosaic,"
"composed of little Pieces of Clay half"
"vitrifyed, and prepared at the Glass-Hou-ses,"
"which the Italians call Smalte. These"
"are much in use at present, and may be"
"made of what Colour and Figure the"

"once floated; and it is not very credi-ble,"
"that the Naturalist could be decei-ved"

"            I saw in the Church-yard of Bolsena"
"an antique Funeral Monument (of that"
"kind which they called a Sarcophagus)"
"very entire, and what is particular, En-graven"
"on all Sides with a curious Re-presentation"
"of a Bacchanal. Had the"
"Inhabitants observed a couple of lewd"
"Figures at one End of it, they would"
"not have thought it a proper Ornament"
"for the Place where it now stands. Af-ter"
"having travelled hence to Aquapen-dente,"
"that stands in a wonderful pleasant"
"Situation, we came to the little Brook"
"which separates the Pope Dominions"
"from the Great Duke  The Frontier"
"Castle of Radicofani is seated on the"
"highest Mountain in the Country, and"
"is as well fortifyed as the Situation of"
"the Place will permit. We here found"
"the natural Face of the Country quite"
"changed from what we had been enter-tained"
"with in the Pope Dominions."
"For instead of the many beautiful Scenes"
"of green Mountains and fruitful Vallies,"
"that we had been presented with for"
"'some Days before, we saw now nothing"
"but a wild naked Prospect of Rocks and"
"Hills, worn on all Sides with Gutters"
"and Channels, and not a Tree or Shrub"
"to be met with in a vast Circuit of several"
"Miles. This Savage Prospect put me"
"in Mind of the Italian Proverb, that"
"The Pope has the Flesh, and the Great"
"Duke the Bones of Italy. Among a large"
"Extent of these Barren Mountains I saw"
"but a single Spot that was cultivated, on"
"which there stood a Convent."
"         "
"         "
"            "
"the Governors live in the greatest Mag-nificence."
"The Churches are very fine,"
"particularly that of the Annunciation,"
"which looks wonderfully beautiful in the"
"Inside, all but one Corner of it being co-vered"
"with Statues, Gilding and Paint."
"A Man would expect, in so very ancient"
"a Town of Italy, to find some considera-ble"
"Antiquities; but all they have to show"
"of this Nature is an old Rostrum of a Ro-man"
"Ship, that stands over the Door of"
"their Arsenal. It is not above a Foot long,"
"and perhaps would never have been"
"thought the Beak of a Ship, had not it"
"been found in so probable a Place as the"
"Haven. It is all of Iron, fashioned at the"
"End like a Boar Head; as I have seen"
"it represented on Medals, and on the Co-lumna"
"Rostrata in Rome. I saw at Genoa"
"Signior Micconi famous Collection of"
"Shells, which, as Father Buonani the Je-fuite"
"has since told me, is one of the best"
"in Italy. I know nothing more remark-able,"
"in the Government of Genoa, than"
"the Bank of St. George, made up of such"
"Branches of the Revenues, as have been"
"'set apart, and appropriated to the dis-charging"
"of several Sums, that have been"
"borrowed from private Persons, during"
"the Exigencies of the Common-wealth."
"            SIENNA,"
"LEGHORNE,"
"PISA."
"            "
"               SIENNA stands high, and is"
"adorned with a great many"
"Towers of Brick, which in"
"the Time of the Common-wealth"
"were erected to"
"'such of the Members as had done"
"any considerable Service to their Coun-try."
"These Towers gave us a sight of"
"the Town a great while before we en-tered"
"it. There is nothing in this City"
"'so extraordinary as the Cathedral, which"
"a Man may view with Pleasure after he"
"has seen St. Peters, though   it is quite of a-nother"
"Make, and can only be looked"
"upon as one of the Master-pieces of Go-thic"
"Architecture. When a Man sees"
"the prodigious Pains and Expence, that"
"our Fore-Fathers have been at in these"
"barbarous Buildings, one cannot but fan-cy"
"to himself what Miracles of Archi-tecture"
"they would have left us, had"
"they only been instructed in the right"
"way; for when the Devotion of those"
"Ages was much warmer than it is at pre-sent,"
"and the Riches of the People"
"much more at the Disposal of the Priests,"
"there was so much Mony consumed on"
"these Gothic Cathedrals, as would have"
"finished a greater Variety of Noble Buil-dings,"
"than have been raised either be-fore"
"or since that Time."
"            One would wonder to see the vast"
"Labour that has been laid out on this"
"'single Cathedral. The very Spouts are"
"loaden with Ornaments, the Windows"
"are formed like so many Scenes of Per-spective,"
"with a Multitude of little Pil-lars"
"retiring one behind another, the"
"great Columns are finely engraven with"
"Fruits and Foliage that run twisting about"
"them from the very Top to the Bottom,"
"the whole Body of the Church is che-quered"
"with different Lays of White and"
"Black Marble, the Pavement curiously"
"cut out in Designs and Scripture-Stories,"
"and the Front covered with such a Va-riety"
"of Figures, and over-run with so"
"many little Mazes and Labyrinths of"
"Sculpture, that nothing in the World"
"can make a prettier Show to those who"
"prefer false Beauties, and affected Orna-ments,"
"to a Noble and Majestick Sim-plicity."
"Over-against this Church stands"
"a large Hospital, erected by a Shooe-Ma-ker"
"who has been Beatifyed, though  ne-ver"
"Sainted. There stands a Figure of"
"him superscribed, Sutor ultra Crepidam."
"I shall speak nothing of the Extent of"
"this City, the Cleanliness of its Streets,"
"nor the Beauty of its Piazza, which so"
"many Travellers have described. As this"
"is the last Republick that fell under the"
"Subjection of the Duke of Florence, so"
"is it still supposed to retain many Han-kerings"
"after its ancient Liberty: For"
"this Reason, when the Keys and Page-ants"
"of the Duke Towns and Govern-ments"
"pass in Procession before him, on"
"St. John Baptist Day, I was told that"
"Sienna comes in the Rear of his Do-minions,"
"and is pushed forward by those"
"who follow, to show the Reluctancy"
"it has to appear in such a Solemnity. I"
"'shall say nothing of the many gross and"
"absurd Traditions of St. Catherine of Si-enna"
"who is the great Saint of this Place."
"I think there is as much Pleasure in"
"hearing a Man tell his Dreams, as in"
"reading Accounts of this Nature: A"
"Traveller, that thinks them worth his"
"Observation, may fill a Book with them"
"at every great Town in Italy."
"            "
"            From Sienna we went forward to"
"Leghorne, where the Two Ports, the"
"Bagnio, and Donatelli Statue of the"
"Great Duke, amidst the Four Slaves"
"chained to his Pedestal, are very noble"
"Sights. The Square is one of the lar-gest,"
"and will be one of the most beau-tiful"
"in Italy, when this Statue is ere-cted"
"in it, and a Town-house built at"
"one End of it to front the Church that"
"'stands at the other. They are at a con-tinual"
"Expence to cleanse the Ports, and"
"keep 'em from being choaked up, which"
"they do by the help of several Engines"
"that are always at work, and employ"
"many of the Great Duke Slaves. What-ever"
"part of the Harbour they scoop in,"
"it has an Influence on all the rest, for"
"the Sea immediately works the whole"
"Bottom to a Level. They draw a dou-ble"
"Advantage from the Dirt that is ta-ken"
"up, as it clears the Port, and at the"
"'same time dries up several Marshes a-bout"
"the Town, where they lay it from"
"time to time. One can scarce imagine"
"how great Profits the Duke of Tuscany"
"receives from this single Place, which"
"are not generally thought so considera-ble,"
"because it passes for a Free Port."
"But, it is very well known how the"
"Great Duke, on a late occasion, not-withstanding"
"the Privileges of the"
"Merchants, drew no small Sums of Mo-ny"
"out of them; though  still, in respect of"
"the exorbitant Dues that are paid at"
"most other Ports, it deservedly retains"
"the Name of Free. It brings into his"
"Dominions a great Increase of People"
"from all other Nations. They reckon in"
"it near Ten Thousand Jews, many of"
"them very Rich, and so great Traffic-kers,"
"that our English Factors complain"
"they have most of our Country Trade"
"in their Hands.  it is true the Strangers"
"pay little or no Taxes directly, but out"
"of every thing they buy there goes a"
"large Gabel to the Government. The"
"very Ice-Merchant at Leghorne pays a-bove"
"a Thousand Pound Sterling annu-ally"
"for his Privilege, and the Tobacco-Merchant"
"Ten Thousand. The Ground"
"is sold by the Great Duke at a very"
"high Price, and Houses are every Day"
"rising on it. All the Commodities that"
"go up into the Country, of which"
"there are great Quantities, are clogged"
"with Impositions as soon as they leave"
"Leghorne. All the Wines, Oils, and"
"Silks that come down from the fruitful"
"Vallies of Pisa, Florence, and other Parts"
"of Tuscany, must make their Way through "
"'several Duties and Taxes before they"
"can reach the Port. The Canal that"
"runs from the Sea into the Arno gives"
"a convenient Carriage to all Goods that"
"are to be shipped off, which does not"
"a little enrich the Owners; and in pro-portion,"
"as private Men grow wealthy,"
"their Legacies, Law-Suits, Daughter the"
"Portions, &amp  encrease, in all which the"
"Great Duke comes in for a considerable"
"Share. The Lucquese, who Traffick at this"
"Port, are said to bring in a great deal into"
"the Duke Coffers. Another Advantage,"
"which may be of great use to him, is,"
"that at Five or Six Days warning he"
"might find Credit in this Town for"
"very large summs of Money, which no"
"other Prince in Italy can pretend to. I"
"need not take notice of the Reputati-on"
"that this Port gives him among Fo-reign"
"Princes, but there is one Benefit"
"arising from it, which, though  never thrown"
"into the Account, is doubtless very con-siderable."
"It is well known how the"
"Pisans and Florentines long regretted the"
"Loss of their ancient Liberty, and their"
"Subjection to a Family that some of"
"them thought themselves equal to, in"
"the flourishing Times of their Com-mon-wealths."
"The Town of Leghorne"
"has accidentally done what the greatest"
"Fetch of Politicks would have found"
"difficult to have brought about, for it"
"has almost unpeopled Pisa, if we com-pare"
"it with what it was formerly, and"
"every Day lessens the Number of the"
"Inhabitants of Florence. This does not"
"only weaken those Places, but at the"
"'same time turns many of the busiest Spi-rits"
"from their old Notions of Honour"
"and Liberty, to the Thoughts of Traf-fick"
"and Merchandise: And as Men en-gaged"
"in a Road of Thriving are no"
"Friends to Changes and Revolutions,"
"they are at present worn into a Habit of"
"Subjection, and push all their Pursuits"
"another way. It is no Wonder there-fore"
"that the Great Duke has such Ap-prehensions"
"of the Pope making Civi-ta"
"Vecchia a Free Port, which may in"
"time prove so very prejudicial to Leg-horne."
"It would be thought an impro-bable"
"Story, should I set down the se-veral"
"Methods that are commonly re-ported"
"to have been made use of, during"
"the last Pontificate, to put a stop to this"
"Design. The Great Duke Mony was"
"'so well bestowed in the Conclave, that"
"'several of the Cardinals dissuaded the"
"Pope from the Undertaking, and at last"
"turned all his Thoughts upon the little"
"Port which he made at Antium, near"
"Nettuno. The chief Work-men that were"
"to have conveyed the Water to Civita"
"Vecchia were bought off, and when a"
"poor Capucin, that was thought Proof"
"against all Bribes, had undertaken to"
"carry on the Work, he dyed a little"
"after he had entered upon it. The pre-sent"
"Pope however, who is very well"
"acquainted with the Secret History, and"
"the Weakness of his Predecessor, seems"
"resolved to bring the Project to its Per-fection."
"He has already been at vast"
"Charges in finishing the Aqueduct, and"
"had some Hopes that, if the War should"
"drive our English Merchants from Sicily"
"and Naples, they would settle here. His"
"Holiness has told some English Gentle-men,"
"that those of our Nation should"
"have the greatest Privileges of any but"
"the Subjects of the Church. One of"
"our Countreymen, who makes a good"
"Figure at Rome, told me the Pope has"
"this Design extremely at his Heart, but"
"that he fears the English will suffer no-thing"
"like a Resident or Consul in his"
"Dominions, though  at the same time he"
"hoped the Business might as well be trans-acted"
"by one that had no publick Cha-racter."
"This Gentleman has so busied"
"himself in the Affair, that he has of-fended"
"the French and Spanish Cardinals,"
"insomuch that Cardinal Janson refused"
"to see him when he would have made"
"his Apology for what he had said to the"
"Pope on this Subject. There is one"
"great Objection to Civita Vecchia, that"
"the Air of the Place is not wholsome;"
"but this they say proceeds from want of"
"Inhabitants, the Air of Leghorne having"
"been worse than this before the Town"
"was well peopled."
"            The great Profits which have accrued"
"to the Duke of Florence from his Free"
"Port have set several of the States of Italy"
"on the same Project. The most likely"
"to succeed in it would be the Genoese,"
"who lye more convenient than the Ve-netians,"
"and have a more inviting Form"
"of Government than that of the Church,"
"or that of Florence. But as the Port of"
"Genoa is so very ill guarded against"
"Storms, that no Privileges can tempt"
"the Merchants from Leghorne into it, so"
"dare not the Genoese make any other of"
"their Ports Free, least it should draw to"
"it most of their Commerce and Inhabi-tants,"
"and by Consequence ruin their"
"chief City."
"            From Leghorne I went to Pisa, where"
"there is still the Shell of a great City,"
"tho' not half furnished with Inhabitants."
"The Great Church, Baptistery, and"
"and Leaning Tower are very well worth"

"Whatever Inconveniencies the State has"
"laboured under, they have never enter-tained"
"a Thought of violating the Pub-lick"
"Credit, or of alienating any Part of"
"these Revenues to other Uses, than to"
"what they have been thus assigned. The"
"Administration of this Bank is for Life,"
"and partly in the Hands of the chief Ci-tizens,"
"which gives them a great Autho-rity"
"in the State, and a powerful Influ-ence"
"over the common people. This"
"Bank is generally thought the greatest"
"Load on the Genoese, and the Managers"
"of it have been represented as a second"
"kind of Senate, that break the Unifor-mity"
"of Government, and destroy, in some"
"measure, the Fundamental Constitution"
"of the State. It is however very certain,"
"that the People reap no small Advantages"
"from it, as it distributes the Power a-mong"
"more particular Members of the"
"Republick, and gives the Commons a Fi-gure:"
"So that it is no small Check up-on"

"               IT is very pleasant to see how"
"the small Territories of this"
"little Republick are cultiva-ted"
"to the best Advantage,"
"'so that one cannot find the"
"least Spot of Ground, that is not made"
"to contribute its utmost to the Owner."
"In all the Inhabitants there appears an"
"Air of Chearfulness and Plenty, not of-ten"
"to be met with in those of the"
"Countries which lye about 'em. There"
"is but one Gate for Strangers to enter"
"at, that it may be known what Num-bers"
"of them are in the Town. Over"
"it is written in Letters of Gold, Li-bertas."
"            "
"            This Republick is shut up in the"
"Great Duke Dominions, who at pre-sent"
"is very much incensed against it, and"
"'seems to threaten it with the Fate of"
"Florence, Pisa, and Sienna. The Oc-casion"
"as follows."
"            The Lucquese plead Prescription for"
"Hunting in one of the Duke Fo-rests,"
"that lyes upon their Frontiers,"
"which about Two Years since was"
"'strictly forbidden them, the Prince in-tending"
"to preserve the Game for his"
"own Pleasure. Two or Three Sports-men"
"of the Republick, who had the"
"Hardiness to offend against the Prohi-bition,"
"were seized, and kept in a neigh-bouring"
"Prison. Their Country-men,"
"to the number of Threescore, attacked"
"the Place where they were kept in Cu-stody,"
"and rescued them. The Great"
"Duke redemands his Prisoners, and, as"
"a further Satisfaction, would have the"
"Governor of the Town, where the"
"Threescore Assailants had combined toge-ther,"
"delivered into his Hands; but re-ceiving"
"only Excuses, he resolved to do"
"himself Justice. Accordingly he ordered"
"all the Lucquese to be seized that were"
"found on a Market-Day, in one of his"
"Frontier Towns. These amounted to"
"Fourscore, among whom were Persons"
"of some Consequence in the Republick."
"They are now in Prison at Florence, and"
"as it is said, treated hardly enough, for"
"there are Fifteen of the Number dead"
"within less than Two Years. The King of"
"Spain, who is Protector of the Com-mon-wealth,"
"received Information from"
"the Great Duke of what had passed, who"
"approved of his Proceedings, and ordered"
"the Lucquese, by his Governour or Mi-lan,"
"to give a proper Satisfaction. The"
"Republick, thinking themselves ill used"
"by their Protector, as they say at Flo-rence,"
"have sent to Prince Eugene to sire"
"the Emperor Protection, with an"
"offer of Winter-Quarters, as it is said,"
"for Four Thousand Germans. The Great"
"Duke rises on them in his Demands,"
"and will not be satisfyed with less than"
"a Hundred Thousand Crowns, and a"
"Solemn Ambassy to beg Pardon for the"
"past, and promise Amendment for the"
"future. Thus stands the Affair at pre-sent,"
"that may end in the Ruin of the"
"Common-wealth, if the French succeed"
"in Italy. It is pleasant however to hear"
"the Discourse of the Common People of"
"Lucca, who are firmly persuaded that"
"One Lucquese can beat Five Florentines,"
"who are grown low spirited, as they pre-tend,"
"by the Great Duke Oppressions,"
"and have nothing worth fighting for."
"They say they can bring into the Field"
"Twenty or Thirty Thousand fighting"
"Men, all ready to Sacrifice their Lives for"
"their Liberty. They have Quantity of"
"Arms and Ammunition, but few Horse."
"It must be owned these People are more"
"happy, at least in Imagination, than the"
"rest of their Neighbours, because they"
"think themselves so; though  such a Chi-merical"
"Happiness is not peculiar to Re-publicans,"
"for we find the Subjects of"
"the most absolute Prince in Europe are"
"as proud of their Monarch as the Luc-quese"
"of being subject to none. Should"
"the French Affairs prosper in Italy, it is"
"possible the Great Duke may bargain for"
"the Republick of Lucca, by the help of"
"his great Treasures, as his Predecessors"
"did formerly with the Emperor for that"
"of Sienna. The Great Dukes have ne-ver"
"yet attempted any thing on Lucca,"
"as not only fearing the Arms of their"
"Protector, but because they are well as-sured,"
"that should the Lucquese be re-duced"
"to the last Extremities, they would"
"rather throw themselves under the Go-vernment"
"of the Geneose, or some strong-er"
"Neighbour, than submit to a State"
"for which they have so great an Aver-sion."
"And the Florentines are very sen-sible,"
"that it is much better having a"
"weak State within their Dominions,"
"than the Branch of one as strong as"
"themselves. But should so formidable a"
"Power, as that of the French King, sup-port"
"them in their Attempts, there is"
"no Government in Italy that would"
"dare to interpose. This Republick, for"
"the Extent of its Dominions, is estee-med"
"the richest and best peopled State"
"of Italy. The whole Administration of"
"the Government passes into different"
"Hands at the End of every Two Months,"
"which is the greatest Security imagina-ble"
"to their Liberty, and wonderfully"
"contributes to the quick Dispatch of all"
"publick Affairs: But in any Exigence"
"of State, like that they are now pressed"
"with, it certainly asks a much longer"
"time to conduct any Design, for the"
"Good of the Common-wealth, to its"
"Maturity and Perfection."

"Florence when there was an"
"Opera acted, which was the"
"Eighth that I had seen in"

"to read the Solemn Protestation of the"
"Poet in the first Page, where he declares"
"that he believes neither in the Fates, Dei-ties,"

"Florence; and as Tuscan Pillars and Ru-stic"
"               "
"Work owe their Original to this"
"Country, the Architects always take care"
"to give them a Place in the great Edifi-ces"
"that are raised in Tuscany. The"
"Duke new Palace is a very noble Pile,"
"built after this manner, which makes"
"it look extremely Solid and Majestick."
"It is not unlike that of Luxemburg at"
"Paris, which was built by Mary of"
"Medicis, and for that Reason perhaps"
"the Workmen fell into the Tuscan Hu-mour."
"I found in the Court of this Pa-lace"
"what I could not meet with any"
"where in Rome. I mean an Antique Sta-tue"
"of Hercules lifting up Antaeus from"
"the Earth, which I have already had"
"occasion to speak of. It was found in"
"Rome, and brought hither under the"
"Reign of Leo the Tenth. There are"
"abundance of Pictures in the several A-partments,"
"by the Hands of the greatest"
"Masters."
"            But  it is the Famous Gallery of the"
"Old Palace, where are perhaps the no-blest"
"Collections of Curiosities to be"
"met with in any Part of the whole World."
"The Gallery it self is made in the Shape"
"of an  according to Mr. Lassel, but,"
"if it must needs be like a Letter, it re-sembles"
"the Greek Π most. It is adorn-ed"
"with admirable Pieces of Sculpture,"
"as well Modern as Ancient. Of the last"
"Sort I shall mention those that are rarest,"
"either for the Person they represent, or"
"the Beauty of the Sculpture. Among"
"the Busts of the Emperors and Empe-resses"
"there are these that follow, which"
"are all very scarce, and some of them"
"almost singular in their kind. Agrippa,"
"               Caligula, Otho, Nerva, Aelius Verus,"
"               Pertinax, Geta, Didius, Julianus, Albi-nus"
"extremely well wrought, and what"
"is seldom seen in Alabaster, Gordianus"
"Africanus the elder, Eliogabalus, Galien"
"the elder, and the younger Pupienus. I"
"have put Agrippa among the Emperors,"
"because he is generally ranged so in Sets"
"of Medals, as some that follow among"
"the Emperesses have no other Right to"
"the Company they are joined with. Do-mitia,"
"               Agrippina Wife of Germanicus,"
"               Antonia, Matidia, Plotina, Mallia Scan-tilla,"
"falsely inscribed under her Bust"
"Julia Severi, Aquilia Severa, Julia Mae-sa."
"I have generally observed at Rome,"
"which is the great Magazine of these"
"Antiquities, that the same Heads which"
"are rare in Medals are also rare in Mar-ble,"
"and indeed one may commonly as-sign"
"the same Reason for both, which"
"was the Shortness of the Emperor"
"Reigns, that did not give the Work"
"men time to make many of their Fi-gures;"
"and as the Shortness of their"
"Reigns was generally occasioned by the"
"Advancement of a Rival, it is no Won-der"
"that no Body worked on the Figure"
"of a Deceased Emperor, when his Ene-my"
"was in the Throne. This Observa-tion"
"however does not always hold. An"
"Agrippa or Caligula, for Example, is a"
"common Coin, but a very extraordina-ry"
"Bust; and a Tiberius a rare Coin, but"
"a common Bust, which one would the"
"more wonder at, if we consider the In-dignities"
"that were offered to this Em-peror's"
"Statues after his Death. The"
"Tiberius in Tiberim is a known Instance."
"            Among the Busts of such Emperors"
"as are common enough, there are seve-ral"
"in the Gallery that deserve to be ta-ken"
"notice of for the Excellence of the"
"Sculpture, as those of Augustus, Vespa-sian,"
"               Adrian, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius"
"Verus, Septimius Severus, Caracalla, Ge-ta."
"There is in the same Gallery a beau-tiful"
"Bust of Alexander the Great, cast-ing"
"up his Face to Heaven, with a no-ble"
"Air of Grief or Discontentedness in"
"his Looks. I have seen Two or Three"
"antique Busts of Alexander in the same"
"Air and Posture, and am apt to think"
"the Sculptor had in his Thoughts the"
"Conqueror weeping for new Worlds,"
"or some other the like Circumstance of"
"his History. There is also in Porphyry"
"the Head of a Faun, and of the God"
"Pan. Among the entire Figures I took"
"particular notice of a Vestal Virgin,"
"with the Holy Fire burning before her."
"This Statue, I think, may decide that"
"notable Controversie among the Anti-quaries,"
"whether the Vestals, after hav-ing"
"received the Tonsure, ever suffered"
"their Hair to come again, for it is here"
"full grown, and gathered under the Veil."
"The Brazen Figure of the Consul, with"
"the Ring on his Finger, reminded me"
"of Juvenal majoris pondera Gemmae."
"There is another Statue in Brass, suppo-sed"
"to be of Apollo, with this Modern"
"Inscription on the Pedestal, which I"
"must confess I do not know what to"
"make of. Ut potui huc veni musis et fra-tre"
"relicto. I saw in the same Gallery"
"the Famous Figure of the Wild Boar,"
"the Gladiator, the Narcissus, the Cupid"
"and Psyche, the Flora, with some Mo-dern"
"Statues that several others have scribed."
"Among the Antique Figures"
"there is a fine one of Morpheus in Touch-stone."
"I have always observed, that this"
"God is represented by the ancient Sta-tuaries"
"under the Figure of a Boy asleep,"
"permitting her Nobles to make any Pur-chase"
"of Lands or Houses in the Domi-nions"
"of a Foreign Prince. For at pre-sent"
"the Greatest, among the Genoese, are"
"in part Subjects to the Monarchy of"
"Spain, by reason of their Estates that lye"
"in the Kingdom of Naples. The Spani-ards"
"Tax them very high upon occasion,"
"and are so sensible of the Advantage this"
"gives them over the Republick, that"
"they will not suffer a Neapolitan to buy"
"the Lands of a Genoese, who must find"
"a Purchaser among his own Country-men,"
"if he has a Mind to sell. For this"
"Reason, as well as on Account of the"
"great Sums of Mony which the Spani-ard"
"owes the Genoese, they are under a"
"Necessity, at present, of being in the In-terest"
"of the French, and would probably"
"continue so, though  all the other States of"
"Italy entered into a League against them."
"Genoa is not yet secure from a Bombard-ment,"
"tho' it is not so exposed as former-ly;"
"for, since the Insult of the French,"
"they have built a Mole, with some little"
"Ports, and have provided themselves with"
"long Guns and Mortars. It is easie for"
"those that are strong at Sea to bring them"
"to what Terms they pleafe; for having but"
"very little Arable Land, they are forced to"
"with a Bundle of Poppy in his Hand."
"I at first took it for a Cupid, 'till I had"
"taken notice that it had neither Bow nor"
"Quiver. I suppose Doctor Lister has"
"been guilty of the same Mistake in the"
"Reflections he makes on what he calls,"
"the sleeping Cupid with Poppy in his"
"Hands."

"               AFTER a very tedious Jour-ney"
"over the Appennines, we"
"at last came to the River that"
"runs at the Foot of them,"

"               "
"            "
"            We here quickly felt the Difference"
"of the Northern from the Southern"
"Side of the Mountains, as well in the"
"Coldness of the Air, as in the Badness"
"of the Wine. This Town is Famous"
"for the Richness of the Soil that lyes"
"about it, and the Magnificence of its"
"Convents. It is likewise esteemed the"
"Third in Italy for Pictures, as having"
"been the School of the Lombard Pain-ters."
"I saw in it Three Rarities of dif-ferent"
"kinds, which pleased me more"
"than any other Shows of the Place. The"
"first was an Authentick Silver Medal of"
"the younger Brutus, in the Hands of an"
"Eminent Antiquary. One may see the"
"Character of the Person in the Features"
"of the Face, which is exquisitely well"
"cut. On the Reverse is the Cap of Li-berty,"
"with a Dagger on each side of it,"
"'subscribed  Mar. for the Ides of March,"
"the famous Date of Caesar Murder."
"The Second was a Picture of Raphel's"
"in St. Giouanni in Monte. It is extreme-ly"
"well preserved, and represents St. Ce-cilia"
"with an Instrument of Musick in"
"her Hands. On one side of her are the"
"Figures of St. Paul, and St. John; and"
"on the other, of Mary Magdalene and"
"St. Austin. There is something won-derfully"
"Divine in the Airs of this Pi-cture."
"I cannot forbear mentioning, for"
"my Third Curiosity, a new Stair-Case"
"that Strangers are generally carryed to see,"
"where the Easiness of the Ascent with-in"
"'so small a Compass, the Disposition"
"of the Lights, and the convenient Land-ing"
"are admirably well contrived. The"
"Wars of Italy, and the Season of the"
"Year, made me pass through  the Dutchies"
"of Modena, Parma, and Savoy with"
"more haste than I would have done at"
"another time. The Soil of Modena and"
"Parma is very rich and well cultivated."
"The Palaces of the Princes are magni-ficent,"
"but neither of them is yet fini-shed."
"We procured a Licence of the"
"Duke of Parma to enter the Theater"
"and Gallery, which deserve to be seen"
"as well as any thing of that Nature in"
"Italy. The Theater is, I think, the"
"most spacious of any I ever saw, and at"
"the same time so admirably well contri-ved,"
"that from the very depth of the"
"Stage the lowest Sound may be heard"
"distinctly to the farthest part of the Au-dience,"
"as in a Whispering Place; and"
"yet if you raise your Voice as high as"
"you please, there is nothing like an cho"
"to cause in it the least Confusion."
"The Gallery is hung with a numerous"
"Collection of Pictures, all done by ce-lebrated"
"Hands. On one Side of the"
"Gallery is a large Room adorned with"
"Inlaid Tables, Cabinets, Works in Am-ber,"
"and other Pieces of great Art and"
"Value. Out of this we were led into"
"another great Room, furnished with"
"old Inscriptions, Idols, Busts, Medals,"
"and the like Antiquities. I could have"
"'spent a Day with great Satisfaction in"
"this Apartment, but had only time to"
"pass my Eye over the Medals, which"
"are in great Number, and many of them"
"very rare. The scarcest of all is a Pe-scennius"
"Niger on a Medalion well pre-served."
"It was coined at Antioch, where"
"this Emperor trifled away his Time 'till"
"he lost his Life and Empire. The Re-verse"
"is a Dea Salus. There are Two"
"of Otho, the Reverse a Serapis; and"
"Two of Messalina and Poppaea in mid-dle"
"Brass, the Reverses of the Emperor"
"Claudius. I saw Two Medalions of Plo-tina"
"and Matidia, the Reverse to each"
"a Pietas; with Two Medals of Perti-nax,"
"the Reverse of one Vota Decenna-lia,"
"and of the other Diis Custodibus;"
"and another of Gordianus Africanus, the"
"Reverse I have forgot."
"            The Principalities of Modena and Par-ma"
"are much about the same Extent,"
"and have each of them Two large"
"Towns, besides a great Number of lit-tle"
"Villages. The Duke of Parma how-ever"
"is much richer than the Duke of"
"Modena. Their Subjects would live in"
"great Plenty amidst so rich and well cul-tivated"
"a Soil, were not the Taxes and"
"Impositions so very Exorbitant; for the"
"Courts are much too splendid and mag-nificent"
"for the Territories that lye a-bout"
"them, and one cannot but be ama-zed"
"to see such a Profusion of Wealth"
"laid out in Coaches, Trappings, Tables,"
"Cabinets, and the like precious Toys,"
"in which there are few Princes of Europe"
"who equal them, when at the same time"
"they have not had the Generosity to"
"make Bridges over the Rivers of their"
"Countries for the Convenience of their"
"Subjects, as well as Strangers, who are"
"forced to pay an unreasonable Exaction"
"at every Ferry upon the least Rising of"
"the Waters. A Man might well expect"
"in these small Governments a much great-er"
"Regulation of Affairs, for the Ease"
"and Benefit of the People, than in large"
"over-grown States, where the Rules of"
"Justice, Beneficence, and Mercy may be"
"easily put out of their Course, in passing"
"thro' the Hands of Deputies, and a long"
"Subordination of Officers. And it would"
"certainly be for the Good of Mankind"
"to have all the mighty Empires and"
"Monarchies of the World cantoned out"
"into petty States and Principalities, that,"
"like so many large Families, might lye"
"under the Eye and Observation of their"
"proper Governors; so that the Care of"
"the Prince might extend it self to every"
"individual Person under his Protection."
"But since such a general Scheme can"
"never be brought about, and if it were,"
"it would quickly be destroyed by the"
"Ambition of some particular State as-piring"
"above the rest, it happens very"
"ill at present to be born under one of"
"these petty Soveraigns, that will be still"
"endeavouring, at his Subjects Cost, to"
"equal the Pomp and Grandeur of great-er"
"Princes, as well as to out-vie those"
"of his own Rank."
"            For this Reason there are no People"
"in the World who live with more Ease"
"and Prosperity than the Subjects of lit-tle"
"Common-wealths, as on the contrary"
"there are none who suffer more under"
"the Grievances of a hard Government,"
"than the Subjects of little Principalities."
"I left the Road of Milan on my Right"
"Hand, having before seen that City, and"
"after having passed through Asti, the"
"Frontier Town of Savoy, I at last came"
"within Sight of the Po, which is a fine"
"River even at Turin, though within Six"
"Miles of its Source. This River has"
"been made the Scene of Two or Three"
"Poetical Stories. Ovid has chosen it"
"out to throw his Phaeton into it, after"
"all the smaller Rivers had been dryed up"
"in the Conflagration."
"            I have read some Botanical Criticks,"

"been turned into Larch-trees; for that"
"it is this kind of Tree which sheds a"
"Gum, and is commonly found on the"
"Banks of the Po. The Change of Cyc-nus"
"into a Swan, which closes up the"
"Disasters of Phaeton Family, was"
"wrought on the same Place where the"

"against the French than even"
"the rest of the Italians. For the great"
"Mischiefs they have suffered from them"
"are still fresh upon their Memories, and"
"notwithstanding this Interval of Peace,"
"one may easily trace out the several Mar-ches"
"which the French Armies have made"
"through their Country, by the Ruin"

"            I came directly from Turin to Gene-va,"
"and had a very easie Journey over"
"Mount Cennis, though about the Begin-ning"
"of December, the Snows having not"
"yet fallen. On the Top of this high"
"Mountain is a large Plain, and in the"
"midst of the Plain a beautiful Lake, which"
"would be very extraordinary were there"
"not several Mountains in the Neighbour-hood"
"rising over it. The Inhabitants there-about"
"pretend that it is unfathomable,"
"and I question not but the Waters of it"
"fill up a deep Valley, before they come"
"to a Level with the Surface of the Plain."
"It is well stocked with Trouts, though"
"they say it is covered with Ice Three"
"Quarters of the Year."
"            There is nothing in the natural Face"
"of Italy that is more delightful to a Tra-veller,"
"than the several Lakes which are"
"dispersed up and down among the ma-ny"
"Breaks and Hollows of the Alps and"
"Appennines. For as these vast Heaps of"
"Mountains are thrown together with so"
"much Irregularity and Confusion, they"
"form a great Variety of hollow Bot-toms,"
"that often lye in the Figure of"
"'so many artificial Basins; where, if any"
"Fountains chance to rise, they naturally"
"'spread themselves into Lakes before they"
"can find any Issue for their Waters."
"The ancient Romans took a great deal"
"of Pains to hew out a Passage for these"
"Lakes to discharge themselves into some"
"neighbouring River, for the bettering"
"of the Air, or the recovering of the"
"Soil that lay underneath them. The"
"Draining of the Fucinus by the Empe-ror"
"Claudius, with the prodigious Mul-titude"
"of Spectators who attended it,"
"and the Famous Naumachia and splendid"
"Entertainment which were made upon"
"it before the Sluces were opened, is a"
"known Piece of History. In all our"
"Journey through the Alps, as well when"
"we climbed as when we descended them,"
"we had still a River running along with"
"the Road, that probably at first occasi-oned"
"the Discovery of this Passage. I"
"'shall end this Chapter with a Descripti-on"
"of the Alps, as I did the last with"
"those of the Appennines. The Poet per-haps"
"would not have taken notice, that"
"there is no Spring nor Summer on these"
"Mountains, but because in this Respect"
"the Alps are quite different from the"
"Appennines, which have as delightful"
"Green Spots among them as any in Italy."

"            GENEVA"
"AND THE"
"LAKE."
"            "
"               NEAR St. Julian in Savoy the"
"Alps begin to enlarge them-selves"
"on all sides, and open"
"into a vast Circuit of Ground,"
"which in Respect of the ther"
"Parts of the Alps may pass for a plain"
"Champian Country. This Extent of"
"Lands, with the Leman Lake, would make"
"one of the prettiest and most defensible"
"Dominions in Europe was it all thrown"
"into a single State, and had Geneva for"
"its Metropolis. But there are Three"
"powerful Neighbours who divide among"
"them the greatest part of this fruitful"
"Country. The Duke of Savoy has the"
"Chablais, and all the Fields that lye be-yond"
"the Arve, as far as to the Ecluse."
"The King of France is Master of the"
"whole Country of Gex; and the Canton of"
"               Bern comes in for that of Vaud. Gene-va"
"and its little Territories lye in the"
"Heart of these Three States. The great-est"
"part of the Town stands upon a Hill,"
"and has its Views bounded on all Sides by"
"'several Ranges of Mountains, which are"
"however at so great a Distance, that"
"they leave open a wonderful Variety of"
"beautiful Prospects. The Situation of"
"these Mountains has some particular Ef-fects"
"on the Country, which they en-close."
"As first, they cover it from all"
"Winds, except the South and North."
" it is to the last of these Winds that the"
"Inhabitants of Geneva ascribe the Health-fulness"
"of their Air; for as the Alps sur-round"
"them on all sides, they form a vast"
"kind of Bason, where there would be a"
"constant Stagnation of Vapours, the"
"Country being so well watered, did not"
"the North Wind put them in Motion,"
"and scatter them from time to time."
"Another Effect the Alps have on Ge-neva"
"is, that the Sun here rises later,"
"and sets sooner than it does to other"
"Places of the same Latitude. I have"
"often observed that the Tops of the"
"neighbouring Mountains have been co-vered"
"with Light above half an Hour"
"after the Sun is down, in respect of"
"those who live at Geneva. These Moun-tains"
"likewise very much increase their"
"Summer Heats, and make up a Hori-zon"
"that has something in it very sin-gular"
"and agreeable. On one Side you"
"have the long Tract of Hills, that goes"
"under the Name of Mount Jura, co-vered"
"with Vineyards and Pasturage, and"
"on the other huge Precipices of naked"
"Rocks rising up in a Thousand odd Fi-gures,"
"and cleft in some Places, so as to"
"discover high Mountains of Snow that"
"lye several Leagues behind them. Towards"
"the South the Hills rise more insensibly,"
"and leave the Eye a vast uninterrupted"
"Prospect for many Miles. But the most"
"beautiful View of all is the Lake, and"
"the Borders of it that lye North of the"
"Town."
"            This Lake resembles a Sea in the Co-lour"
"of its Waters, the Storms that are"
"raised on it, and the Ravage it makes on"
"its Banks. It receives too a different"
"Name from the Coasts it washes, and in"
"Summer has something like an Ebb and"
"Flow, which arises from the melting of"
"the Snows that fall into it more copious-ly"
"at Noon, than at other times of the"
"Day. It has Five different States bor-dering"
"on it, the Kingdom of France,"
"the Dutchy of Savoy, the Canton of"
"Bern, the Bishoprick of Sion, and the"
"            PAVIA,"
"MILAN, &amp "
"            FROM Genoa we took Chaise for Mi-lan,"
"and by the way stopped at Pa-via,"
"that was once the Metropolis of a"
"Kingdom, but is at present a poor Town."
"We here saw the Convent of Austin"
"Monks, who about Three Years ago"
"pretended to have found out the Body"
"of the Saint, that gives the Name to"
"their Order. King Luitprand, whose"
"Ashes are in the same Church, brought"
"hither the Corps, and was very industri-ous"
"to conceal it, lest it might be abused"
"by the barbarous Nations, which at that"
"time ravaged Italy. One would there-fore"
"rather wonder that it has not been"
"found out much earlier, than that it is"
"discovered at last. The Fathers howe-ver"
"do not yet find their Account in the"
"Discovery they have made; for there are"
"Canons Regular, who have half the same"
"Republick of Geneva. I have seen Pa-pers"
"fixed up in the Canton of Bern, with"
"this magnificent Preface; Whereas we"
"have been informed of several Abuses com-mitted"
"in our Ports and Harbours on the"
"Lake, &amp "
"            I made a little Voyage round the Lake,"
"and touched on the several Towns that"
"lye on its Coasts, which took up near"
"Five Days, though  the Wind was pretty"
"fair for us all the while."
"            The Right Side of the Lake from"
"Geneva belongs to the Duke of Savoy, and"
"is extreamly well cultivated. The great-est"
"Entertainment we found in coasting"
"it were the several Prospects of Woods,"
"Vineyards, Meadows, and Corn-Fields"
"which lye on the Borders of it, and run"
"up all the Sides of the Alps, where the"
"Barrenness of the Rocks, or the Steep-ness"
"of the Ascent will suffer them."
"The Wine however on this side of the"
"Lake is by no means so good as that"
"on the other, as it has not so open a Soil,"
"and is less exposed to the Sun. We here"
"passed by Yvoire, where the Duke keeps his"
"Gallies, and lodged at Tonon, which is the"
"greatest Town on the Lake belonging to"
"the Savoyard. It has Four Convents,"
"and they say about six or seven Thou-sand"
"Inhabitants. The Lake is here about"
"Twelve Miles in Breadth. At a little"
"Distance from Tonon stands Ripaille, where"
"is a Convent of Carthusians. They have"
"a large Forest cut out into Walks, that are"
"extremely thick and gloomy, and very"
"'suitable to the Genius of the Inhabitants."
"There are Vista in it of a great Length,"
"that terminate upon the Lake. At one"
"Side of the Walks you have a near Pro-spect"
"of the Alps, which are broken in-to"
"'so many Steps and Precipices, that they"
"fill the Mind with an agreeable kind of"
"Horror, and form one of the most ir-regular"
"mis-shapen Scenes in the World."
"The House that is now in the Hands of"
"the Carthusians belonged formerly to the"
"Hermites of St. Maurice, and is famous"
"in History for the Retreat of an"
"Anti-Pope, who called himself Felix the"
"Fifth. He had been Duke of Savoy,"
"and after a very glorious Reign took on"
"him the Habit of a Hermite, and retired"
"into this Solitary Spot of his Domini-ons."
"His Enemies will have it, that he"
"lived here in great Ease and Luxury,"
"from whence the Italians to this Day"
"make use of the Proverb, Andare a Ri-paglia;"
"and the French, Faire Ripaille, to"
"express a delightful kind of Life. They"
"'say too, that he had great Managements"
"with several Eccelesiasticks before he"
"turned Hermite, and that he did it in"
"the View of being advanced to the Pon-tificate."
"However it was, he had not"
"been here half a Year before he was cho-sen"
"Pope by the Council of Basil who"
"took upon them to Depose Eugenio the"
"Fourth. This promised fair at first, but"
"by the Death of the Emperor, who fa-voured"
"Amadeo, and the Resolution of"
"Eugenio, the greatest part of the Church"
"threw it self again under the Govern-ment"
"of their deposed Head. Our An-ti-Pope"
"however was still supported by"
"the Council of Basil, and owned by Sa-voy,"
"               Switzerland, and a few other little"
"States. This Schism lasted in the Church"
"Nine Years, after which Felix voluntarily"
"resigned his Title into the Hands of Pope"
"Nicholas the Fifth, but on the following"
"Conditions, That Amadeo should be the"
"First Cardinal in the Conclave; That"
"the Pope should always receive him"
"'standing, and offer him his Mouth to"
"kiss; That he should be perpetual Car-dinal-Legate"
"in the States of Savoy and"
"Switzerland, and in the Archbishopricks"
"of Geneva, Sion, Bress, &amp  And last-ly,"
"That all the Cardinals of his Crea-tion"
"'should be recognized by the Pope."
"After he had made a Peace so acceptable"
"to the Church, and so honourable to"
"himself, he spent the Remainder of his"
"Life with great Devotion at Ripaille,"
"               "
"and dyed with an extraordinary Repu-tation"
"of Sanctity."
"            At Tonon they showed us a Fountain"
"of Water that is in great Esteem for its"
"Wholesomness. They say it weights"
"Two Ounces in a Pound less than the"
"'same Measure of the Lake Water, not-withstanding"
"this last is very good to"
"Drink, and as clear as can be imagined."
"A little above Tonon is a Castle and small"
"Garrison. The next Day we saw other"
"'small Towns on the Coast of Sa-voy,"
"where there is nothing but Misery"
"and Poverty. The nearer you come to"
"the End of the Lake the Mountains on"
"each side grow thicker and higher, 'till"
"at last they almost meet. One often sees"
"on the Tops of the Mountains several"
"'sharp Rocks that stand above the rest;"
"for as these Mountains have been doubt-less"
"much higher than they are at pre-sent,"
"the Rains have washed away a-bundance"
"of the Soil, that has left the"
"Veins of Stone shooting out of them;"
"as in a decayed Body the Flesh is still"
"'shrinking from the Bones. The Natu-ral"
"Histories of Switzerland talk very"
"much of the Fall of these Rocks, and"
"the great Damage they have sometimes"
"done, when their Foundations have been"
"mouldered with Age, or rent by an"
"Earthquake. We saw in several Parts"
"of the Alps that bordered upon us vast"
"Pits of Snow, as several Mountains that"
"lye at a greater Distance are wholly co-vered"
"with it. I fancyed the Confusion"
"of Mountains and Hollows, I here ob-served,"
"furnished me with a more proba-ble"
"Reason than any I have met with for"
"those Periodical Fountains in Switzer-land,"
"which flow only at such particular"
"Hours of the Day. For as the Tops of"
"these Mountains cast their Shadows upon"
"one another, they hinder the Sun shining"
"on several Parts at such certain times, so"
"that there are several Heaps of Snow which"
"have the Sun lying upon them Two or"
"Three Hours together, and are in the"
"Shade all the Day afterwards. If there-fore"
"it happens that any particular Foun-tain"
"takes its Rise from any of these Re-servoirs"
"of Snow, it will naturally begin"
"to flow on such Hours of the Day as"
"the Snow begins to melt: but as soon as"
"the Sun leaves it again to freeze and"
"harden, the Fountain dries up, and re-ceives"
"no more Supplies 'till about the"
"'same time the next Day, when the Heat"
"of the Sun again sets the Snows a run-ning"
"that fall into the same little Con-duits,"
"Traces, and Canals, and by Con-sequence"
"break out and discover them-selves"
"always in the same Place. At the"
"very Extremity of the Lake the Rhone"
"enters, and, when I saw it, brought a-long"
"with it a prodigious Quantity of"
"Water; the Rivers and Lakes of this"
"Country being much higher in Summer"
"than in Winter, by reason of the melt-ing"
"of the Snows. One would wonder"
"how so many Learned Men could fall"
"into so great an Absurdity, as to believe"
"this River could preserve it self unmixed"
"with the Lake 'till its going out again"
"at Geneva, which is a Course of many"
"Miles. It was extreamly muddy at its"
"Entrance when I saw it, though as clear"
"as Rock-Water at its going out. Be-sides,"
"that it brought in much more Wa-ter"
"than it carryed off. The River in-deed"
"preserves it self for about a Quar-ter"
"of a Mile in the Lake, but is af-terwards"
"'so wholly mixed, and lost with"
"the Waters of the Lake, that one dis-covers"
"nothing like a Stream 'till within"
"about a Quarter of a Mile of Geneva."
"From the End of the Lake to the Source"
"of the Rhone is a Valley of about Four"
"Days Journey in Length, which gives"
"the Name of Vallesins to its Inhabitants,"
"and is the Dominion of the Bishop of"
"Sion. We lodged the Second Night at"
"Ville Neuve, a little Town in the Can-ton"
"of Bern, where we found good Ac-commodations,"
"and a much greater Ap-pearance"
"of Plenty than on the other"
"'side of the Lake. The next Day, hav-ing"
"passed by the Castle of Chillon, we"
"came to Versoy, another Town in the"
"Canton of Bern, where Ludlow retired"
"after having left Geneva and Lausanne."
"The Magistrates of the Town warned"
"him out of the First by the Sollicitation"
"of the Dutchess of Orleans, as the Death"
"of his Friend Lisle made him quit the ther."
"He probably chose this Retreat"
"as a Place of the greatest Safety, it be-ing"

"From Lausanne to Geneva we coasted a-long"
"the Country of the Vaud, which"
"is the fruitfullest and best cultivated Part"
"of any among the Alps. It belonged for-merly"
"to the Duke of Savoy, but was"
"won from him by the Canton of Bern,"
"and made over to it by the Treaty of St."
"Julian, which is still very much regret-ted"
"by the Savoyard. We called in at"
"Morge, where there is an artificial Port,"
"and a show of more Trade than in any"
"other Town on the Lake. From Morge"
"we came to Nyon. The Colonia questris,"
"that Julius Caesar settled in this"
"Country, is generally supposed to have"
"been planted in this Place. They have"
"often dug up old Roman Inscriptions"
"Church in their Hands, that will by no"
"means allow it to be the Body of the"
"Saint, nor is it yet recognised by the"
"Pope. The Monks say for themselves,"
"that the very Name was written on the"
"Urn where the Ashes lay, and that in"
"an old Record of the Convent, they are"
"'said to have been interred between the"
"very Wall and the Altar where they"
"were taken up. They have already too,"
"as the Monks told us, begun to justifie"
"themselves by Miracles. At the Corner"
"of one of the Cloisters of this Convent"
"are buryed the Duke of Suffolk, and the"
"Duke of Lorrain, who were both killed"
"in the famous Battel of Pavia. Their"
"Monument was erected to them by one"
"Charles Parker, an Ecclesiastic, as I"
"learned from the Inscription, which I"
"cannot omit Transcribing, since I have"

"in Length from Mount Jura to the"
"Borders of the Lake, as he has descri-bed"

"The next Town upon the"
"Lake is Versoy, which we could not"
"have an opportunity of seeing, as belong-ing"
"to the King of France. It has the"
"Reputation of being extremely poor and"
"beggarly. We sailed from hence di-rectly"
"for Geneva, which makes a very"
"noble Show from the Lake. There are"
"near Geneva several Quarries of Free-stone"
"that run under the Lake. When"
"the Water is at lowest they make with-in"
"the Borders of it a little Square en-closed"
"with Four Walls. In this Square"
"they sink a Pit, and dig for Freestone;"
"the Walls hindering the Waters from"
"coming in upon them, when the Lake"
"rises and runs on all Sides of them. The"
"great Convenience of Carriage makes"
"these Stones much cheaper than any"
"that can be found upon firm Land."
"One sees several deep Pits that have been"
"made at several times as one sails over"
"them. As the Lake approaches Geneva"
"it grows still narrower and narrower,"
"'till at last it changes its Name into the"
"Rhone, that turns all the Mills of the"
"Town, and is extremely rapid, notwith-standing"
"its Waters are very deep. As"
"I have seen a great Part of the Course"
"of this River, I cannot but think it has"
"been guided by the particular Hand of"
"Providence. It rises in the very Heart"
"of the Alps, and has a long Valley that"
"'seems hewn out on purpose to give its"
"Waters a Passage amidst so many Rocks"
"and Mountains which are on all Sides"
"of it. This brings it almost in a direct"
"Line to Geneva. It would there over-flow"
"all the Country, were there not"
"one particular Cleft that divides a vast"
"Circuit of Mountains, and conveys it off"
"to Lyons. From Lyons there is another"
"great Rent, which runs across the whole"
"Country in almost another streight Line,"
"and notwithstanding the vast height of"
"the Mountains that rise about it, gives"
"it the shortest Course it can take to fall"
"into the Sea. Had such a River as this"
"been left to it self to have found its way"
"out from among the Alps, whatever"
"Windings it had made it must have for-med"
"'several little Seas, and have laid ma-ny"
"Countries under Water before it had"
"come to the End of its Course. I shall"
"not make any Remarks upon Geneva,"
"that is a Republick so well known to"
"the English. It lyes at present under"
"'some Difficulties by reason of the Em-peror's"

"will certainly raise a Sedition among the"
"People, unless the Magistrates find some"
"way to remedy it: and they say it is al-ready"
"done by the Interposition of the"
"States of Holland. The Occasion of the"
"Emperor Prohibition was their furnish-ing"
"great Sums to the King of France"
"for the Payment of his Army in Italy."
"They obliged themselves to remit, after"
"the rate of Twelve Hundred Thousand"
"Pounds Sterling, per Annum, divided in-to"
"'so many Monthly Payments. As the"
"Interest was very great, several of the"
"Merchants of Lyons, who would not"
"trust their King in their own Names,"
"are said to have contributed a great"
"deal under the Names of Geneva"
"Merchants. The Republick fancies"
"it self hardly treated by the Em-peror,"
"'since it is not any Action of the"
"State, but a Compact among private"
"Persons that hath furnished out these se-veral"
"Remittances. They pretend how-ever"

"            About Two Leagues from Fribourg"
"we went to see a Hermitage, that is"
"reckoned the greatest Curiosity of these"
"Parts. It lyes in the prettiest Solitude"
"imaginable, among Woods and Rocks,"
"which at first Sight dispose a Man to be"
"'serious. There has lived in it a Hermite"
"these Five and Twenty Years, who with"
"his own Hands has worked in the Rock"
"a pretty Chappel, a Sacristie, a Chamber,"
"Kitchin, Cellar, and other Convenien-ces."
"His Chimney is carryed up through"
"the whole Rock, so that you see"
"the Sky through it, notwithstanding"
"the Rooms lye very deep. He has cut"
"the Side of the Rock into a Flat for a"
"Garden, and by laying on it the waste"
"Earth that he has found in several of"
"the neighbouring Parts, has made such"
"a Spot of Ground of it as furnishes out"
"a kind of Luxury for a Hermite. As"
"he saw Drops of Water distilling from"
"'several Parts of the Rock, by following"
"the Veins of them, he has made him-self"
"Two or Three Fountains in the"
"Bowels of the Mountain, that serve his"
"Table, and water his little Garden."
"            We had very bad Ways from hence"
"to Bern, a great Part of them through"
"Woods of Fir-trees. The great Quan-tity"
"of Timber they have in this Coun-try"
"makes them mend their High-ways"
"with Wood instead of Stone. I could"
"not but take notice of the Make of se-veral"
"of their Barns I here saw. After"
"having laid a Frame of Wood for the"
"Foundation, they place at the Four"
"Corners of it Four huge Blocks; cut"
"in such a Shape as neither Mice nor a-ny"

"the Sides of them, at the same time that"
"they raise the Corn above the Moisture"
"that might come into it from the Ground."

"by these Four Blocks."
"            What pleased me most at Bern was"
"their publick Walks by the Great"
"Church. They are raised extremely"
"high, and that their Weight might not"
"break down the Walls and Pilasters"

"are about Twenty Five Leagues distance"

"are in it a Hundred Bourgeois, and about"
"a Thousand Souls. Their Government"
"is modelled after the same manner with"
"that of the Cantons, as much as so small"

"large an Extent. For this Reason though"
"they have very little Business to do, they"
"have all the Variety of Councils and Of-ficers"

"to meet in, adorned with the Arms"

"Matters of Importance. The River that"
"runs through their Dominions puts them"
"to the Charge of a very large Bridge,"

"over Head, like the rest in Switzerland."
"Those that travel over it pay a certain"
"Due towards the Maintenance of this"
"Bridge. And as the French Ambassador"
"has often occasion to pass this way, his"
"Master gives the Town a Pension of"
"Twenty Pound Sterling, which makes"
"them extremely industrious to raise all"
"the Men they can for his Service, and"
"keeps this powerful Republick firm to"

"the Preserving of the Bridge, with"
"the Regulation of the Dues arising"
"from it, is the grand Affair that cuts out"
"Employment for the several Councils of"
"State. They have a small Village be-longing"

"very fine Pile of Building. The Fron-tispiece"
"has Pillars of a beautiful Black"
"Marble streaked with White, which is"
"found in the neighbouring Mountains."
"The Chambers for the several Councils,"
"with the other Apartments are very neat."
"The whole Building is indeed so well signed,"
"that it would make a good Figure"
"even in Italy. It is pity they have spoiled"
"the Beauty of the Walls with abundance"
"of childish Latin Sentences, that consist"
"often in a Jingle of Words. I have in-deed"
"observed in several Inscriptions of"
"this Country, that your Men of Learn-ing"
"here are extremely delighted in play-ing"
"little Tricks with Words and Fi-gures;"

"got out of Anagram and Acrostick. The"
"Library is a very large Room, pretty well"
"filled. Over it is another Room fur-nished"

"of Medals, but don remember"
"to have met with any in it that are ex-traordinary"
"rare. The Arsenal is better"
"than that of Bern, and they say has Arms"
"for Thirty Thousand Men. At about a"
"Day Journey from Zurich we entered"
"on the Territories of the Abbot of St."
"Gaul. They are Four Hours Riding in"
"Breadth, and Twelve in Length. The"
"Abbot can raise in it an Army of Twelve"
"Thousand Men well armed and exercised."
"He is Soveraign of the whole Country,"
"and under the Protection of the Cantons"
"of Zurich, Lucerne, Glaris and Switz."
"He is always chosen out of the Abby of"
"Benedictines at St. Gaul. Every Father"
"and Brother of the Convent has a Voice"
"in the Election, which must afterwards"
"be confirmed by the Pope. The last"
"Abbot was Cardinal Sfondrati, who was"
"advanced to the Purple about Two"
"Years before his Death. The Abbot"
"takes the Advice and Consent of his"
"Chapter before he enters on any Matter"
"of Importance, as the levying of a Tax,"
"or declaring of a War. His chief Lay-Officer"
"is the Grand Maître  Hôtel, or"
"High-Steward of the Houshold, who"
"is named by the Abbot, and has the Ma-nagement"
"of all Affairs under him."
"There are several other Judges and Di-stributers"
"of Justice appointed for the se-veral"
"Parts of his Dominions, from"
"whom there always lyes an Appeal to"
"the Prince. His Residence is gene-raliy"
"at the Benedictine Convent at"
"St. Gaul, notwithstanding the Town of"
"St. Gaul is a little Protestant Republick,"
"wholly independent of the Abbot, and"
"under the Protection of the Cantons."
"            One would wonder to see so many"
"rich Bourgeois in the Town of St. Gaul,"
"and so very few poor People in a Place"
"that has scarce any Lands belonging to"
"it, and little or no Income but what"
"arises from its Trade. But the great"
"Support and Riches of this little State is"
"its Linnen Manufacture, which employs"
"almost all Ages and Conditions of its"
"Inhabitants. The whole Country about"
"them furnishes them with vast Quanti-ties"
"of Flax, out of which they are said"
"to make yearly Forty Thousand Pieces"
"of Linnen Cloath, reckoning Two Hun-dred"
"Ells to the Piece. Some of their"
"Manufacture is as finely wrought as any"
"that can be met with in Holland; for"
"they have Excellent Artizans, and great"
"Commodities for Whitening. All the"
"Fields about the Town were so covered"
"with their Manufacture, that com-ing"
"in the Dusk of the Evening we"
"mistook them for a Lake. They send off"
"their Works upon Mules into Italy,"
"               Spain, Germany, and all the adjacent"
"Countries. They reckon in the Town"
"of St. Gaul, and in the Houses that lye"
"'scattered about it, near Ten Thousand"
"Souls, of which there are Sixteen Hun-dred"
"Burgeois. They chuse their Coun-cils"
"and Burgo-Masters out of the Body"
"of the Burgeois, as in the other Govern-ments"
"of Switzerland, which are every"
"where of the same Nature, the diffe-rence"
"lying only in the Numbers of"
"'such as are employed in State Affairs,"
"which are proportioned to the Grandeur"
"of the States that employ them. The"
"Abby and the Town bear a great Aver-sion"
"to one another; but in the General"
"Diet of the Cantons their Representatives"
"'sit together, and act by Concert. The"
"Abbot deputes his Grand Maître  Hô-tel,"
"and the Town one of its Burgo-Masters."
"            About Four Years ago the Town and"
"Abby woued have come to an open Rup-ture,"
"had it not been timely prevented by"
"the Interposition of their common Pro-tectors."
"The Occasion was this, A Bene-dictine"
"Monk, in one of their annual Pro-cessions,"
"carried his Cross erected through"
"the Town with a Train of Three or"
"Four Thousand Peasants following him."
"They had no sooner entered the Convent"
"but the whole Town was in a Tumult,"
"occasioned by the Insolence of the Priest,"
"who, contrary to all Precedents, had"
"presumed to carry his Cross in that"
"manner. The Burgeois immediately put"
"themselves in Arms, and drew down"
"Four Pieces of their Cannon to the"
"Gates of the Convent. The Procession"
"to escape the Fury of the Citizens durst"
"not return by the Way it came, but af-ter"
"the Devotions of the Monks were"
"finished, passed out at a Back-door of"
"the Convent, that immediately led into"
"the Abbot Territories. The Abbot on"
"his Part raises an Army, blocks up the"
"Town on the Side that faces his Domi-nions,"
"and forbids his Subjects to fur-nish"
"it with any of their Commodities."
"While things were just ripe for a War,"
"the Cantons, their Protectors, inter-posed"
"as Umpires in the Quarrel, con-demning"
"the Town that had appeared"
"too forward in the Dispute to a Fine of"
"Two Thousand Crowns; and Enacting"
"at the same time, That as soon as any"
"Procession entered their Walls, the Priest"
"'should let the Cross hang about his"
"Neck without touching it with either"
"Hand, 'till he came within the Precincts"
"of the Abby. The Citizens could bring"
"into the Field near Two Thousand Men"
"well exercised, and armed to the best"
"Advantage, with which they fancy they"
"could make Head against Twelve or"
"Fifteen Thousand Peasants, for so many"
"me as I Travelled through "
"the Countries, of which"
"I here give Your Lord-ship"
"'some Account: For"
"whatever great Impres-sions"
"an Englishman must"
"have of Your Lordship,"

"conversant Abroad will"

"called the Tesin. This River falls into the"
"Po, and is excessively rapid. The Bishop"
"of Salisbury says, that he ran down with"

"But the Protestant Subjects of"
"the Abby, who they say make up a good"
"Third of its People, would probably, in"
"case of a War, abandon the Cause of"
"their Prince for that of their Religion."
"The Town of St. Gaul has an Arsenal,"
"Library, Town-Houses, and Churches"
"proportionable to the Bigness of the"
"State. It is well enough fortifyed to re-sist"
"any sudden Attack, and to give the"
"Cantons time to come to their Assi-stance."
"The Abby is by no means so"
"Magnificent as one would expect from"
"its Endowments. The Church is one"
"huge Nef with a double Aisle to it. At"
"each End is a large Quire. The one of"
"them is supported by vast Pillars of"
"Stone, cased over with a Composition"
"that looks the most like Marble of any"
"thing one can imagine. On the Cieling"
"and Walls of the Church are Lists of"
"Saints, Martyrs, Popes, Cardinals, Arch-Bishops,"
"Kings and Queens that have"
"been of the Benedictine Order. There"
"are several Pictures of such as have been"
"distinguished by their Birth, Sanctity, or"
"Miracles, with Inscriptions that let you"
"into the Name and History of the Per-sons"
"represented. I have often wished"
"that some Traveller would take the Pains"
"to gather together all the Modern In-scriptions"
"which are to be met with in"
"Roman Catholick Countries, as Gruter"
"and others have copyed out the ancient"
"Heathen Monuments. Had we Two"
"or Three Volumes of this Nature, with-out"
"any of the Collector own Refle-ctions,"
"I am sure there is nothing in the"
"World could give a truer Idea of the"
"Roman Catholick Religion, nor expose"
"more the Pride, Vanity and Self-Inte-rest"
"of Convents, the Abuse of Indul-gencies,"
"the Folly and Impertinence of"
"Votaries, and in short the Superstition,"
"Credulity, and Childishness of the Ro-man"
"Catholick Religion. One might"
"fill several Sheets at St. Gaul, as there"
"are few considerable Convents or"
"Churches that would not afford large"
"Contributions."
"            As the King of France distributes his"
"Pensions through all the Parts of Swit-zerland,"
"the Town and Abby of St. Gaul"
"come in too for their Share. To the"
"First he gives Five Hundred Crowns"
"per Annum, and to the other a Thou-sand."
"This Pension has not been paid"
"these Three Years, which they attribute"
"to their not acknowledging the Duke"
"of Anjou for King of Spain. The Town"
"and Abby of St. Gaul carry a Bear for"
"their Arms. The Roman Catholicks"
"have this Bear Memory in very great"
"Veneration, and represent him as the"
"first Convert their Saint made in the"
"Country. One of the most Learned of"
"the Benedictine Monks gave me the fol-lowing"
"History of him, which he deli-vered"
"to me with Tears of Affection in"
"his Eyes. St. Gaul it seems, whom they"
"call the great Apostle of Germany, found"
"all this Country little better than a vast"
"Desart. As he was walking in it on a"
"very cold Day he chanced to meet a Bear"
"in his Way. The Saint, instead of be-ing"
"'startled at the Rencounter, ordered"
"the Bear to bring him a Bundle of Wood,"
"and make him a Fire. The Bear served"
"him to the best of his Ability, and at"
"his Departure was commanded by the"
"Saint to retire into the very Depth of"
"the Woods, and there to pass the rest of"
"his Life without ever hurting Man or"
"Beast. From this time, says the Monk,"
"the Bear lived irreproachably, and ob-served"
"to his dying Day the Orders that"
"the Saint had given him."
"            I have often considered, with a great"
"deal of Pleasure, the profound Peace"
"and Tranquillity that reigns in Switzer-land"
"and its Alliances. It is very won-derful"
"to see such a Knot of Govern-ments,"
"which are so divided among them-selves"
"in Matters of Religion, maintain"
"'so uninterrupted an Union and Corre-spondance,"
"that no one of them is for"
"Invading the Rights of another, but re-mains"
"content within the Bounds of its"
"First Establishment. This, I think, must"
"be chiefly ascribed to the Nature of the"
"People, and the Constitution of their"
"Governments. Were the Swiss animated"
"by Zeal or Ambition, some or other of"
"their States would immediately break in"
"upon the rest; or were the States so ma-ny"
"Principalities, they might often have"
"an ambitious Soveraign at the Head of"
"them, that would embroil his Neigh-bours,"
"and sacrifice the Repose of his"
"Subjects to his own Glory. But as the In-habitants"
"of these Countries are naturally"
"of a heavy Phlegmatick Temper, if any"
"of their leading Members have more Fire"
"and Spirit than comes to their Share, it"
"is quickly tempered by the Coldness and"
"Moderation of the rest who sit at the"
"Helm with them. To this we may add,"
"that the Alps is the worst Spot of"
"Ground in the World to make Conquests"
"in, a great Part of its Governments be-ing"
"'so naturally intrenched among Woods"
"and Mountains. However it be, we"
"find no such Disorders among them as"
"one would expect in such a Multitude"
"of States; for as soon as any Publick"
"Rupture happens, it is immediately closed"
"up by the Moderation and good Offices"
"of the rest that interpose."
"            As all the considerable Governments"
"among the Alps are Common-wealths,"
"'so indeed it is a Constitution the most"
"adapted of any other to the Poverty"
"and Barrenness of these Countries. We"
"may see only in a neighbouring Govern-ment"
"the ill Consequences of having a"
"Despotic Prince, in a State that is most"
"of it composed of Rocks and Moun-tains;"
"for notwithstanding there is a"
"vast Extent of Lands, and many of them"
"better than those of the Swiss and Gri-sons,"
"the common People, among the"
"latter, are much more at their Ease, and"
"in a greater Affluence of all the Conve-niences"
"of Life. A Prince Court eats"
"too much into the Income of a poor"
"State, and generally introduces a kind"
"of Luxury and Magnificence, that sets"
"every particular Person upon making a"
"higher Figure in his Station than is ge-nerally"
"consistent with his Revenue."
"            It is the great Endeavour of the se-veral"
"Cantons of Switzerland, to banish"
"from among them every thing that looks"
"like Pomp or Superfluity. To this End"
"the Ministers are always Preaching, and"
"the Governors putting out Edicts against"
"Dancing, Gaming, Entertainments, and"
"fine Cloaths. This is become more ne-cessary"
"in some of the Governments,"
"'since there are so many Refugees settled"
"among them; for though  the Protestants"
"in France affect ordinarily a greater Plain-ness"
"and Simplicity of Manners, than"
"those of the same Quality who are of"
"the Roman Catholick Communion, they"
"have however too much of their Coun-try-Gallantry"
"for the Genius and Con-stitution"
"of Switzerland. Should Dres-sing,"
"Feasting, and Balls once get among"
"the Cantons, their Military Roughness"
"would be quickly lost, their Tempers"
"would grow too soft for their Climate,"
"and their Expences out-run their In-comes,"
"besides that the Materials for"
"their Luxury must be brought from ther"
"Nations, which would immediate-ly"
"ruin a Country that has few Commo-dities"
"of its own to export, and is not"
"over-stocked with Mony. Luxury in-deed"
"wounds a Republick in its very tals,"
"as its natural Consequences are Ra-pine,"
"Avarice and Injustice; for the"
"more Mony a Man spends, the more"
"must he endeavour to augment his"
"Stock; which at last sets the Liberty"
"and Votes of a Common-wealth to Sale,"
"if they find any Foreign Power that is"
"able to pay the Price of them. We see no"
"where the pernicious Effects of Luxury"
"on a Republick more than in that of"
"the ancient Romans, who immediately"
"found it self poor as soon as this Vice"
"got Footing among them, though they"
"were possessed of all the Riches in the"
"World. We find in the Beginnings"
"and Increases of their Common-wealth"
"'strange Instances of the Contempt of"
"Mony, because indeed they were utter"
"Strangers to the Pleasures that might be"
"procured by it; or in other Words, be-cause"
"they were wholly ignorant of the"
"Arts of Luxury. But as soon as they"
"once entered into a Taste of Pleasure,"
"Politeness and Magnificence, they fell"
"into a Thousand Violences, Conspira-cies,"
"and Divisions that threw them in-to"
"all the Disorders imaginable, and ter-minated"
"in the utter Subversion of the"
"Common-wealth. It is no wonder there-fore"
"the poor Common-wealths of Swit-zerland"
"are ever labouring at the Sup-pression"
"and Prohibition of every thing"
"that may introduce Vanity and Luxury."
"Beside the several Fines that are set up-on"
"Plays, Games, Balls and Feastings,"
"they have many Customs among them"
"which very much contribute to the"
"keeping up of their ancient Simplicity."
"The Bourgeois, who are at the Head"
"of the Governments, are obliged to ap-pear"
"at all their publick Assemblies in a"
"Black Cloak and a Band. The Wo-mens"
"Dress is very plain, those of the"
"best Quality wearing nothing on their"
"Heads generally but Furs, which are to"
"be met with in their own Country."
"The Persons of different Qualities in"
"both Sexes are indeed allowed their dif-ferent"
"Ornaments, but these are gene-rally"
"'such as are by no means costly, be-ing"
"rather designed as Marks of Di-stinction"
"than to make a Figure. The"
"chief Officers of Bern, for Example,"
"are known by the Crowns of their Hats,"
"which are much deeper than those of"
"an inferior Character. The Peasants are"
"generally cloathed in a coarse kind of"
"Canvas, that is the Manufacture of the"
"Country. Their Holy-day Cloaths go"
"from Father to Son, and are seldom worn"
"out, 'till the Second or Third Genera "
"So that it is common enough to"
"'see a Countryman in the Doublet and"
"Breeches of his Great-grand-father."
"            "
"               Geneva is much politer than Switzer-land,"
"or any of its Allies, and is there-fore"
"looked upon as the Court of the"
"               Alps, whither the Protestant Cantons"
"often send their Children to improve"
"themselves in Language and Education."
"The Genevois have been very much re-fined,"
"or as others will have it, corrup-ted"
"by the Conversation of the French"
"Protestants, who make up almost a Third"
"of their People. It is certain they have"
"very much forgotten the Advice that"
"Calvin gave them in a great Council a"
"little before his Death, when he recom-mended"
"to them, above all Things, an"
"Exemplary Modesty and Humility, and"
"as great a Simplicity in their Manners"
"as in their Religion. Whether or no"
"they have done well, to set up for mak-ing"
"another kind of Figure, Time will"
"witness. There are several that fancy"
"the great Sums they have remitted into"
"Italy, though by this means they make"
"their Court to the King of France at"
"present, may some time or other give"
"him an Inclination to become the Ma-ster"
"of so wealthy a City."
"            As this Collection of little States a-bounds"
"more in Pasturage than in Corn,"
"they are all provided with their pub-lick"
"Granaries, and have the Humanity"
"to furnish one another in publick Exi-gencies,"
"when the Scarcity is not Uni-versal."
"As the Administration of Af-fairs"
"relating to these publick Grana-ries,"
"is not very different in any of the"
"particular Governments, I shall content"
"my self to set down the Rules observed"
"in it by the little Common-wealth of"
"Geneva, in which I had more Time to"
"inform my self of the Particulars than"
"in any other. There are Three of the"
"Little Council deputed for this Office."
"They are obliged to keep together a"
"Provision sufficient to feed the People"
"at least Two Years, in case of War or"
"Famine. They must take care to fill"
"their Magazines in Times of the great-est"
"Plenty, that so they may afford cheap-er,"
"and increase the publick Revenue"
"at a small Expence of its Members."
"None of the Three Managers must, up-on"
"any Pretence, furnish the Granaries"
"from his own Fields, that so they may"
"have no Temptation to pay too great"
"a Price, or put any bad Corn upon the"
"Publick. They must buy up no Corn"
"growing within Twelve Miles of Ge-neva,"
"that so the filling of their Maga-zines"
"may not prejudice their Mar-ket,"
"and raise the Price of their Provi-sions"
"at Home. That such a Collection"
"of Corn may not spoil in keeping, all"
"the Inns and Publick-Houses are obliged"
"to furnish themselves out of it, by which"
"means is raised the most considerable"

"            A Poet of another Nation would not"
"have dwelt so long upon the Clearness"
"and Transparency of the Stream, but in"
"Italy one seldom sees a River that is ex-treamly"
"bright and limpid, most of them"
"falling down from the Mountains, that"
"make their Waters very troubled and"
"muddy, whereas the Tesin is only an Out-let"
"of that vast Lake, which the Italians"
"now call the Lago Maggiore."

"            I saw between Pavia and Milan the"
"Convent of Carthusians, which is very spa-cious"
"and beautiful. Their Church is"
"extreamly fine, and curiously adorned,"
"but of a Gothic Structure."
"            I could not stay long in Milan with-out"
"going to see the Great Church that"
"Branch of the publick Revenues; the"
"Corn being sold out at a much dearer"
"Rate than  it is bought up. So that the"
"greatest Income of the Common-wealth,"
"which pays the Pensions of most of"
"its Officers and Ministers, is raised on"
"Strangers and Travellers, or such of their"
"own Body as have Mony enough to"
"'spend at Taverns and Publick-Houses."
"            It is the Custom in Geneva and Swit-zerland"
"to divide their Estates equally"
"among all their Children, by which"
"means every one lives at his Ease with-out"
"growing dangerous to the Repub-lick,"
"for as soon as an overgrown state"
"falls into the Hands of one that"
"has many Children, it is broken into so"
"many Portions as render the Sharers of"
"it Rich enough, without raising them"
"too much above the Level of the rest."
"This is absolutely necessary in these lit-tle"
"Republicks, where the Rich Mer-chants"
"live very much within their states,"
"and by heaping up vast Sums"
"from Year to Year might become for-midable"
"to the rest of their Fellow-Ci-tizens,"
"and break the Equality, which is"
"'so necessary in these kinds of Govern-ments,"
"were there not means found out"
"to distribute their Wealth among seve-ral"
"Members of their Republick. At"
"Geneva, for Instance, are Merchants"
"reckoned worth Twenty Hundred Thou-sand"
"Crowns, though, perhaps, there"
"is not one of them who spends to the"
"value of Five Hundred Pounds a Year."
"            Though the Protestants and Papists"
"know very well that it is their com-mon"
"Interest to keep a steddy Neutra-lity"
"in all the Wars between the States"
"of Europe, they cannot forbear siding"
"with a Party in their Discourse. The"
"Catholicks are zealous for the French"
"King, as the Protestants do not a little"
"glory in the Riches, Power, and good"
"Success of the English and Dutch, whom"
"they look upon as the Bulwarks of the"
"Reformation. The Ministers in parti-cular,"
"have often preached against such"
"of their Fellow-Subjects as enter into"
"the Troops of the French King; but so"
"long as the Swiss see their Interest in it,"
"their Poverty will always hold them"
"fast to his Service. They have indeed"
"the Exercise of their Religion, and"
"their Ministers with them, which is the"
"more remarkable, because the very same"
"Prince, refused even those of the Church"
"of England, who followed their Master"
"to St. Germains, the publick Exercise"
"of their Religion."
"            Before I leave Switzerland I cannot"
"but observe, that the Notion of Witch-craft"
"reigns very much in this Country."
"I have often been tired with Accounts"
"of this Nature from very sensible Men,"
"that are most of them furnished with"
"Matters of Fact which have happened,"
"as they pretend, within the compass of"
"their own Knowledge. It is certain"
"there have been many Executions on this"
"Account, as in the Canton of Bern there"
"were some put to Death during my"
"Stay at Geneva. The People are so niversally"
"infatuated with the Notion,"
"that if a Cow falls sick, it is Ten to"
"One but an Old Woman is clapt up in"
"Prison for it, and if the poor Creature"
"chance to think her self a Witch, the"
"whole Country is for hanging her up"
"without Mercy. One finds indeed the"
"'same Humour prevail in most of the"
"rocky Barren Parts of Europe. Whe-ther"
"it be that Poverty and Ignorance,"
"which are generally the Products of"
"these Countries, may really engage a"
"Wretch in such dark Practices, or whe-ther"
"or no the same Principles may not"
"render the People too credulous, and"
"perhaps too easy to get rid of some of"
"their unprofitable Members."
"            A great Affair that employs the Swiss"
"Politicks at present is the Prince of Con-ti's"
"Succession to the Dutchess of Ne-mours"

"in the Government of Neuf-Cha-tel."
"The Inhabitants of Neuf-Chatel can"
"by no means think of submitting them-selves"
"to a Prince who is a Roman Ca-tholick,"
"and a Subject of France. They"

"the Principality of Orange, which they"
"did not question but he would Rule with"
"all the Mildness and Moderation imagina-ble,"
"as it would be the best Means in the"
"World to recommend him to Neuf-Cha-tel."
"But notwithstanding it was so much"
"his Interest to manage his Protestant"
"Subjects in that Country, and the strong"
"Assurances he had given them in pro-tecting"
"them in all their Privileges, and"
"particularly in the free Exercise of their"
"Religion, he made over his Principality"
"in a very little time for a Sum of Mony"
"to the King of France. It is indeed ge-nerally"
"believed the Prince of Conti would"
"rather still have kept his Title to Orange,"
"but the same Respect which induced him"
"to quit this Government, might at ano-ther"
"time tempt him to give up that of"
"Neuf-Chatel on the like Conditions. The"
"King of Prussia lays in his claim for"
"Neuf-Chatel, as he did for the Principa-lity"
"of Orange, and  it is probable would"
"be more acceptable to the Inhabitants"

"disposed to declare themselves a Free"
"Common-wealth, after the Death of the"
"Dutchess of Nemours, if the Swiss will"
"'support them. The Protestant Cantons"
"'seem much inclined to assist them, which"
"they may very well do, in case the Dut-chess"
"dies whilst the King of France has"
"his Hands so full of Business on all sides"
"of him. It certainly very much concerns"
"them not to suffer the French King to"
"Establish his Authority on this side"
"Mount Jura, and on the very Borders"
"of their Country; but it is not easie to"
"foresee what a round Sum of Mony,"
"or the Fear of a Rupture with France,"
"may do among a People who have"
"tamely suffered the Franche Comptè to"
"be seized on, and a Fort to be built"
"within Cannon-shot of one of their"
"Cantons."
"            There is a new sprung up in"
"Switzerland, which spreads very much"
"in the Protestant Cantons. The Pro-fessors"
"of it call themselves Pietists, and"
"as Enthusiasm carries Men generally to"
"the like Extravagancies, they differ but"
"little from several Sectaries in other"
"Countries. They pretend in general to"
"great Refinements, as to what regards"
"the Practice of Christianity, and to ob-serve"
"the following Rules. To retire"
"much from the Conversation of the"
"World. To sink themselves into an"
"entire Repose and Tranquillity of Mind."
"In this State of Silence to attend the se-cret"
"Illapse and Flowings in of the Ho-ly"
"Spirit, that may fill their Minds with"
"Peace and Consolation, Joys or Rap-tures."
"To favour all his secret Intima-tions,"
"and give themselves up entirely"
"to his Conduct and Direction, so as"
"neither to speak, move, or act, but as"
"they find his Impulse on their Souls."
"To retrench themselves within the Con-veniencies"
"and Necessities of Life. To"
"make a Covenant with all their Senses,"
"'so far as to shun the Smell of a Rose or"
"Violet, and to turn away their Eyes from"
"a beautiful Prospect. To avoid, as much"
"as is possible, what the World calls In-nocent"
"Pleasures, lest they should have"
"their Affections tainted by any Sensuali-ty,"
"and diverted from the Love of him"
"who is to be the only Comfort, Repose,"
"Hope, and Delight, of their whole Beings."
"This prevails very much among the"
"Protestants of Germany, as well as those"
"of Switzerland, and has occasioned se-veral"
"Edicts against it in the Dutchy"
"of Saxony. The Professors of it are ac-cused"
"of all the ill Practices which may"
"'seem to be the Consequence of their"
"Principles, as that they ascribe the worst"
"of Actions, which their own vicious"
"Tempers throw them upon, to the Di-ctates"
"of the Holy Spirit; that both"
"Sexes under Pretence of Devout Con-versation"
"visit one another at all Hours,"
"and in all Places, without any regard to"
"common Decency, often making their"
"Religion a Cover for their Immorali-ties;"
"and that the very best of them are"
"possessed with Spiritual Pride, and a"
"Contempt for all such as are not of their"
"own  The Roman Catholicks, who"
"reproach the Protestants for their break-ing"
"into such a Multitude of Religions,"
"have certainly taken the most effectual"
"way in the World for the keeping their"
"Flocks together; I don mean the Pu-nishments"
"they inflict on Mens Persons,"
"which are commonly looked upon as the"
"chief Methods by which they deter them"
"from breaking through the Pale of the"
"Church, though certainly these lay a"
"very great Restraint on those of the"
"Roman Catholick Persuasion. But I"
"take one great Cause why there are so"
"few Sects in the Church of Rome, to"
"be the Multitude of Convents, with which"
"they every where abound, that serve as"
"Receptacles for all those fiery Zealots"
"who would set the Church in a Flame,"
"were not they got together in these"
"Houses of Devotion. All Men of dark"
"Tempers, according to their Degree of"
"Melancholy or Enthusiasm, may find"
"Convents fitted to their Humours, and"
"meet with Companions as gloomy as"
"themselves. So that what the Prote-stants"
"would call a Fanatick, is in the"
"Roman Church a Religious of such or"
"'such an Order; as I have been told of"
"an English Merchant at Lisbon, who af-ter"
"'some great Disappointments in the"
"World was resolved to turn Quaker or"
"Capuchin; for, in the Change of Reli-gion,"
"Men of ordinary Understandings"
"don so much consider the Principles,"
"as the Practice of those to whom they"
"go over."
"            From St. Gaul I took Horse to the"
"Lake of Constance, which lyes at Two"
"Leagues Distance from it, and is formed"
"by the Entry of the Rhine. This is the"
"only Lake in Europe that disputes for"
"Greatness with that of Geneva; it ap-pears"
"more beautiful to the Eye, but"
"wants the fruitful Fields and Vineyards"
"that border upon the other. It receives"
"its Name from Constance, the chief Town"

"to which the Protestants not"
"consenting, the whole Project fell to"
"the Ground. We crossed the Lake to"
"Lindaw, and in several Parts of it ob-served"
"abundance of little Bubbles of"
"Air, that came working upward from"
"the very Bottom of the Lake. The"
"Watermen told us, that they are ob-served"
"always to rise in the same Places,"
"from whence they conclude them to be"
"'so many Springs that break out of the"
"Bottom of the Lake. Lindaw is an Im-perial"
"Town on a little Island that lyes"
"at about Three Hundred Paces from the"
"firm Land, to which it is joined by a"
"huge Bridge of Wood. The Inhabitants"
"were all in Arms when we passed through"
"it, being under great Apprehensions of"
"the Duke of Bavaria, after his having"
"fallen upon Ulm and Memminghen. They"
"flatter themselves, that by cutting their"
"Bridge they could hold out against his"

"of Bombs would quickly reduce the"
"Burgeois to Surrender. They were for-merly"
"Bombarded by Gustavus Adolphus."
"               "
"We were advised by our Merchants, by"
"no means to venture our selves in the"
"Duke of Bavaria Country, so that we"
"had the Mortification to lose the Sight"
"of Munich, Ausburg, and Ratisbon, and"
"were forced to take our Way to Vienna"

"I had heard so much of, but was never"
"more deceived in my Expectation than"
"at my first entering: For the Front,"
"which was all I had seen of the Outside,"
"is not half finished, and the Inside is so"
"'smutted with Dust, and the Smoak of"
"Lamps, that neither the Marble, nor"
"the Silver, nor Brass-Works show them-selves"
"to an Advantage. This vast Gothic"
"Pile of Building is all of Marble, except"
"the Roof, which would have been of the"
"'same Matter with the rest, had not its"
"Weight rendered it improper for that"
"part of the Building. But for the Rea-son"
"I have just now mentioned, the Out-side"
"of the Church looks much whiter"
"and fresher than the Inside; for where"
"the Marble is so often washed with Rains,"
"it preserves it self more beautiful and un-sullyed,"
"than in those Parts that are not"
"at all exposed to the Weather. That"
"Side of the Church indeed, which faces"
"the Tramontane Wind, is much more"
"unsightly than the rest, by reason of the"
"Dust and Smoak that are driven against"
"it. This Profusion of Marble, though  asto-nishing"
"to Strangers, is not very won-derful"
"in a Country that has so many"
"Veins of it within its Bowels. But though "
"the Stones are cheap, the working of"
"them is very expensive. It is generally"
"            TIROL,"
"INSPRUCK,"
"HALL, &amp "
"            "
"               AFTER having coasted the"
"Alps for some time, we at last"
"entered them by a Passage"
"which leads into the long"
"Valley of the Tirol, and fol-lowing"
"the Course of the River Inn we"
"came to Inspruck, that receives its Name"
"from this River, and is the Capital Ci-ty"
"of the Tirol."
"            "
"            "
"               Inspruck is a handsome Town, though"
"not a great one, and was formerly the"
"Residence of the Arch-Dukes who were"
"Counts of Tirol: The Palace where they"
"used to keep their Court is rather Con-venient"
"than Magnificent. The great"
"Hall is indeed a very noble Room, the"
"Walls of it are painted in Fresco, and"
"represent the Labours of Hercules. Ma-ny"
"of them look very finely, though a"
"great part of the Work has been cracked"
"by Earthquakes, which are very fre-quent"
"in this Country. There is a lit-tle"
"Wooden Palace that borders on the"
"other, whither the Court used to retire"
"at the first shake of an Earthquake. I"
"'saw here the largest Menage that I have"
"met with any where else. At one End"
"of it is a great Partition designed for an"
"Opera. They showed us also a very"
"pretty Theatre. The last Comedy that"
"was acted on it was designed by the Je-suits"
"for the Entertainment of the Queen"
"of the Romans, who passed this way from"
"Hanover to Vienna. The Compliment"
"which the Fathers made her Majesty on"
"this occasion was very particular, and"
"did not a little expose them to the"
"Raillery of the Court. For the Arms of"
"Hanover being a Horse, the Fathers"
"thought it a very pretty Allusion to re-present"
"the Queen by Bucephalus, that"
"would let no Body get upon him but"
"Alexander the Great. The Wooden"
"Horse that acted this nobtale Part is still"
"to be seen behind the Scenes. In one"
"of the Rooms of the Palace which is"
"hung with the Pictures of several Illu-strious"
"Persons, they showed us the Por-trait"
"of Mary Queen of the Scots, who"
"was beheaded in the Reign of"
"Queen Elizabeth. The Gardens about"
"the House are very large, but ill kept."
"There is in the middle of them a beau-tiful"
"Statue in Brass of an Arch-Duke"
"Leopold on Horseback. There are near"
"it Twelve other Figures of Water-Nymphs"
"and River-Gods well Cast, and"
"as big as the Life. They were designed"
"for the Ornaments of a Water-Work,"
"as one might easily make a great Vari-ety"
"of Jetteaus at a small Expence in a"
"Garden that has the River Inn running"
"by its Walls. The late Duke of Lor-rain"
"had this Palace, and the Govern-ment"
"of the Tirol assigned him by the"
"Emperor, and his Lady the Queen Dow-ager"
"of Poland lived here several Years"
"after the Death of the Duke her Hus-band."
"There are covered Galleries that"
"lead from the Palace to Five different"
"Churches. I passed through a very long"
"one which reaches to the Church of the"
"Capucin Convent, where the Duke of"
"Lorrain used often to assist at their Mid-night"
"Devotions. They showed us in"
"this Convent the Apartments of Maxi-milian,"
"who was Arch-Duke and Count"
"of Tirol about Fourscore Years ago. This"
"Prince at the same time that he kept the"
"Government in his Hands, lived in this"
"Convent with all the Rigor and Auste-rity"
"of a Capucin. His Anti-Chamber"
"and Room of Audience are little square"
"Chambers Wainscoated. His private"
"Lodgings are Three or Four small"
"Rooms faced with a kind of Fret-work,"
"that makes them look like little Hollow"
"Caverns in a Rock. They preserve this"
"Apartment of the Convent uninhabited,"
"and show in it the Altar, Bed and Stove,"
"as likewise a Picture and a Stamp of this"
"Devout Prince. The Church of the"
"Franciscan Convent is famous for the Mo-nument"
"of the Emperor Maximilian the"
"First, which stands in the midst of it. It"
"was erected to him by his Grand-Son"
"Ferdinand the First, who probably looked"
"upon this Emperor as the Founder of"
"the Austrian Greatness. For as by his"
"own Marriage he annexed the Low-Countries"
"to the House of Austria, so"
"by matching his Son to Joan of Arra-gon"
"he settled on his Posterity the King-dom"
"of Spain, and by the Marriage of"
"his Grand-Son Ferdinand got into his"
"Family the Kingdoms of Bohemia and"
"Hungary. This Monument is only Ho-norary,"
"for the Ashes of the Emperor"
"lye elsewhere. On the Top of it is a"
"Brazen Figure of Maximilian on his"
"Knees, and on the Sides of it a beau-tiful"
"Bas Relief representing the Actions"
"of this Prince. His whole History is"
"digested into Twenty Four square Pan-nels"
"of Sculpture in Bas Relief: The"
"Subject of Two of them is his Confede-racy"
"with Henry the Eighth, and the"
"Wars they made together upon France."
"On each Side of this Monument is a"
"Row of very noble Brazen Statues much"
"bigger than the Life, most of them re-presenting"
"'such as were some way or ther"
"related to Maximilian. Among the"
"rest is one that the Fathers of the Con-vent"
"tell us represents King Arthur the"
"old British King. But what Relation"
"had that Arthur to Maximilian? I don't"
"question therefore but it was signed"
"for Prince Arthur, Elder Bro-ther"
"of Henry the Eighth, who had es-poused"
"Catharine, Sister of Maximilian,"
"whose Divorce afterwards gave occasi-on"
"to such signal Revolutions in Eng-land."
"This Church was built by Ferdinand"
"the First. One sees in it a kind of Offer at"
"Modern Architecture, but at the same"
"time that the Architect has shown his"
"Dislike of the Gothick manner, one may"
"'see very well that in that Age they were"
"not, at least in this Country, arrived"
"at the Knowledge of the true Way."
"The Portal, for Example, consists of a"
"composite Order unknown to the Anci-ents;"
"the Ornaments indeed are taken"
"from them, but so put together that you"
"'see the Volutes of the Ionic, the Foliage"
"of the Corinthian, and the Uovali of the"
"Doric mixed without any Regularity on"
"the same Capital. So the Vault of the"
"Church, though  broad enough, is encum-bered"
"with too many little Tricks in"
"Sculpture. It is indeed supported with"
"'single Columns instead of those vast"
"Clusters of little Pillars that one meets"
"with in Gothic Cathedrals, but at the"
"'same time these Columns are of no regu-lar"
"Order, and at least Twice too long"
"for their Diameter. There are other"
"Churches in the Town, and Two or"
"Three Palaces which are of a more Mo-dern"
"Make, and built with a good Fan-cy."
"I was shown the little Notredame"
"that is handsomly designed, and topped"
"with a Cupola. It was made as an Of-fering"
"of Gratitude to the Blessed Vir-gin,"
"for having defended the Country"
"of the Tirol against the Victorious Arms"
"of Gustavus Adolphus, who could not"
"enter this Part of the Empire after ha-ving"
"over-run most of the rest. This"
"Temple was therefore built by the Con-tributions"
"of the whole Country. At"
"about half a League distance from In-spruck"
"'stands the Castle of Amras, fur-nished"
"with a prodigious Quantity of"
"Medals, and many other sorts of Rari-ties"
"both in Nature and Art, for which"
"I must refer the Reader to Monsieur Pa-tin's"
"Account in his Letter to the Duke"
"of Wirtemburg, having my self had nei-ther"
"Time or Opportunity to enter into"
"a particular Examination of them."
"            From Inspruck we came to Hall, that"
"lyes at a League distance on the same"
"River. This Place is particularly fa-mous"
"for its Salt-Works. There are in"
"the Neighbourhood vast Mountains of"
"a transparent kind of Rock not unlike"
"Allum, extreamly solid, and as piquant"
"to the Tongue as Salt it self. Four or"
"Five Hundred Men are always at Work"
"in these Mountains, where as soon as"
"they have hewn down any Quantities of"
"the Rock they let in their Springs and"
"Reservoirs among their Works. The"
"Water eats away and dissolves the Par-ticles"
"of Salt which are mixed in the"
"Stone, and is conveyed by long Troughs"
"and Canals from the Mines to the Town"
"of Hall, where  it is received in vast Ci-sterns,"
"and boiled off from time to"
"time."
"            "
"               "
"They make after the rate of Eight"
"Hundred Loaves a Week, each Loaf"
"Four Hundred Pound Weight. This"
"would raise a great Revenue to the Em-peror,"
"were there here such a Tax on"
"Salt as there is in France. At present he"
"clears but Two Hundred Thousand"
"Crowns a Year, after having defrayed"
"all the Charges of working it. There"
"are in Switzerland, and other Parts of"
"the Alps, several of these Quarries of"
"Salt that turn to very little Account, by"
"Reason of the great Quantities of Wood"
"they consume."
"            The Salt-Works at Hall have a great"
"Convenience for Fuel which swims down"
"to them on the River Inn. This Ri-ver,"
"during its Course through the Ti-rol,"
"is generally shut up between a dou-ble"
"Range of Mountains that are most"
"of them covered with Woods of Fir-Trees."
"Abundance of Peasants are em-ployed"
"in the hewing down of the lar-gest"
"of these Trees, that, after they are"
"Barked and cut into Shape, are tumbled"
"down from the Mountains into the"
"Stream of the River, which carries them"
"off to the Salt-Works. At Inspruck"
"they take up vast Quantities for the Con-vents"
"and publick Officers, who have a"
"certain Portion of it alloted them by the"
"Emperor: the rest of it passes on to"
"Hall. There are generally several Hun-dred"
"Loads afloat, for they begin to cut"
"above Twenty Five Leagues up the Ri-ver"
"above Hall, and there are other Ri-vers"
"that flow into the Inn, which bring"
"in their Contributions. These Salt-Works,"
"and a Mint that is established at"
"the same Place, have rendered this Town,"
"notwithstanding the Neighbourhood of"
"the Capital City, almost as populous as"
"Inspruck it self. The Design of this"
"Mint is to work off part of the Metals"
"which are found in the neighbouring"
"Mountains; where, as we were told,"
"there are Seven Thousand Men in con-stant"
"Employ. At Hall we took a Boat"
"to carry us to Vienna. The First Night"
"we lay at Rottenburg, where is a strong"
"Castle above the Town. Count Serini"
"is still close Prisoner in this Castle, who,"
"as they told us in the Town, had lost his"
"Senses by his long Imprisonment and Af-flictions."
"The next Day we Dined at"
"Kuff-stain, where there is a Fortress on"
"a high Rock above the Town almost"
"inaccessible on all Sides: This being"
"a Frontier Place on the Dutchy of"
"Bavaria, where we entered after about"
"an Hour Rowing from Kuff-stain. It"
"was the pleasantest Voyage in the World"
"to follow the Windings of this River"
"Inn through such a Variety of pleasing"
"Scenes as the Course of it naturally led"
"us. We had sometimes on each Side"
"us a vast Extent of naked Rocks and"
"Mountains, broken into a Thousand ir-regular"
"Steeps and Precipices; in other"
"Places we saw a long Forest of Fir-Trees"
"'so thick set together, that it was impos-sible"
"to discover any of the Soil they"
"grew upon, and rising up so regularly"
"one above another, as to give us the"
"View of a whole Wood at once. The"
"time of the Year, that had given the"
"Leaves of the Trees so many different"
"Colours, compleated the Beauty of the"
"Prospect. But as the Materials of a fine"
"Landskip are not always the most profi-table"
"to the Owner of them, we met"
"with but very little Corn or Pasturage"
"for the Proportion of Earth that we"
"passed through, the Lands of the Tirol"
"not being able to feed the Inhabitants."
"This long Valley of the Tirol lyes en-closed"
"on all Sides by the Alps, though "
"its Dominions shoot out into several"
"Branches that lye among the Breaks and"
"Hollows of the Mountains. It is go-verned"
"by Three Councils residing at"
"Inspruck, one sits upon Life and Death,"
"the other is for Taxes and Impositions,"
"'said there are Eleven Thousand Statues"
"about the Church, but they reckon in-to"
"the Account every particular Figure"
"in the History-pieces, and several little"
"Images which make up the Equipage of"
"those that are larger. There are indeed a"
"great Multitude of such as are bigger"
"than the Life: I reckoned above Two"
"Hundred and Fifty on the Outside of"
"the Church, though  I only told Three Sides"
"of it; and these are not half so thick"
"'set as they intend them. The Statues are"
"all of Marble, and generally well cut; but"
"the most valuable one they have is a"
"St. Bartholomew, new-flead, with his Skin"
"hanging over his Shoulders: It is esteemed"
"worth its weight in Gold: They have"
"inscribed this Verse on the Pedestal, to"
"'show the Value they have for the Work-man."

"Dedicated to St. Charles Borromee,"
"where I saw his Body, in Episcopal"
"Robes, lying upon the Altar in a Shrine"
"and a third for the common Distributi-ons"
"of Justice. As these Courts regulate"
"themselves by the Orders they receive"
"from the Imperial Court, so in many"
"Cases there are Appeals from them to"
"Vienna. The Inhabitants of the Tirol"
"have many particular Privileges above"
"those of the other Hereditary Countries"
"of the Emperor. For as they are natu-rally"
"well fortifyed among their Moun-tains,"
"and at the same time border upon"
"many different Governments, as the Gri-sons,"
"               Venetians, Swiss, Bavarians, &amp "
"a severe Treatment might tempt them"
"to set up for a Republick, or at least"
"throw themselves under the milder Go-vernment"
"of some of their Neighbours:"
"Besides that their Country is poor, and"
"that the Emperor draws considerable In-comes"
"out of its Mines of Salt and Me-tal."
"They are these Mines that fill the"
"Country with greater Numbers of Peo-ple"
"than it would be able to bear"
"without the Importation of Corn from"
"Foreign Parts. The Emperor has Forts"
"and Cittadels at the Entrance of all the"
"Passes that lead into the Tirol, which"
"are so advantagiously placed upon Rocks"
"and Mountains, that they command all"
"the Vallies and Avenues that lye about"
"them. Besides, that the Country it self"
"is cut into so many Hills and Inequali-ties,"
"as would render it defensible by a ve-ry"
"little Army against a numerous Enemy."
"It was therefore generally thought the"
"Duke of Bavaria would not attempt"
"the cutting off any Succours that were"
"'sent to Prince Eugene; or the forcing"
"his Way through the Tirol into Italy."

"'shut up among Mountains, passes gene-rally"

"            At Two Miles distance from Milan"
"there stands a Building, that would have"

"Architect designed it for an Artificial"
"Echo. We discharged a Pistol, and had"
"the Sound returned upon us above Fifty"
"Six times, though  the Air was very foggy."
"The first Repetitions follow one ano-ther"
"very thick, but are heard more di-stinctly"
"in proportion as they decay:"
"There are Two parallel Walls which beat"
"the Sound back on each other, 'till the"
"Undulation is quite worn out, like the"
"'several Reverberations of the same Image"
"from two opposite Looking-Glasses."
"Father Kircher has taken notice of this"
"particular Echo, as Father Bartolin has"
"done since in his Ingenious Discourse on"
"Sounds. The State of Milan is like a"
"vast Garden, surrounded by a Noble"
"Mound-Work of Rocks and Mountains:"
"Indeed if a Man considers the Face of"
"               Italy in general, one would think that"
"Nature had laid it out into such a Varie-ty"
"of States and Governments as one"
"finds in it. For as the Alpes at one End,"
"and the long Range of Appenines, that"
"passes through  the Body of it, branch out"
"on all sides into several different Divisi-ons;"
"they serve as so many natural Boun-daries"
"and Fortifications to the little Ter-ritories"
"that lye among them. Accor-dingly"
"we find the whole Country cut"
"into a Multitude of particular King-doms"
"and Common-wealths in the oldest"
"Accounts we have of it, 'till the Power"
"of the Romans, like a Torrent that verflows"
"its Banks, bore down all before"
"it, and spread it self into the remotest"
"Corners of the Nation. But as this Ex-orbitant"
"Power became unable to sup-port"
"it self, we find the Government of"
"Italy again broken into such a Variety"
"of Sub-Divisions, as naturally suits with"
"its Situation."
"            In the Court of Milan, as in several"
"others of Italy, there are many who fall"
"in with the Dress and Carriage of the"
"French. One may however observe a kind"
"of Awkwardness in the Italians, which ea-sily"
"discovers the Airs they give them-selves"
"not to be natural. It is indeed"
"very strange there should be such a"
"Diversity of Manners, where there is"
"'so small a difference in the Air and Cli-mate."
"The French are always Open,"
"Familiar and Talkative: The Italians,"
"on the contrary, are Stiff, Ceremonious"
"and Reserved. In France every one"
"aims at a Gaiety and Sprightliness of Be-haviour,"
"and thinks it an Accomplish-ment"
"to be brisk and lively: The Itali-ans,"

"of Temper, affect always to appear"
"Sober and Sedate; insomuch that one"
"'sometimes meets Young Men walking"
"the Streets with Spectacles on their"
"Noses, that they may be thought to"
"have impaired their Sight by much"
"Study, and seem more Grave and Judi-cious"
"than their Neighbours. This Dif-ference"
"of Manners proceeds chiefly"
"from Difference of Education: In France"
"it is usual to bring their Children into"
"Company, and to cherish in them, from"
"their Infancy, a kind of Forwardness"
"and Assurance: Besides, that the French"
"apply themselves more universally to their"
"Exercises than any other Nation in the"

"well as of their Water-Works; so that"
"their surpassing of them at present is to"
"be attributed rather to the Greatness of"
"their Riches, than the Excellence of"
"their Taste. I saw the Terrace-Garden"
"of Verona, that Travellers gene-rally"
"mention. Among the Churches of"
"Verona, that of St. George is the hand-somest:"

"Ranges lye Fields of Corn, which in"
"these warm Countries ripens much bet-ter"

"Year to Year. We arrived so late at cenza,"
"               "
"that we had not time to take a"
"full Sight of the Place. The next Day"
"brought us to Padua. St. Anthony, who"
"lived about Five Hundred Years ago, is"
"the great Saint to whom they here pay"
"their Devotions. He lyes buried in the"
"Church that is Dedicated to him at pre-sent,"
"tho' it was formerly Consecrated"

"magnificent, and very richly adorned."
"There are narrow Clefts in the Monu-ment"

"Catholicks rub their Beads, and smell"

"with it, it is observed that the Scent is"
"'stronger in the Morning than at Night."
"There are abundance of Inscriptions and"
"Pictures hung up by his Votaries in se-veral"
"Parts of the Church: For it is the"
"way of those that are in any Signal Dan-ger"
"to implore his Aid, and if they come"
"off safe they call their Deliverance a Mi-racle,"
"and perhaps hang up the Picture"
"or Description of it in the Church. This"

"               HAving often heard Venice re-presented"
"as one of the most"
"defensible Cities in the"
"World, I took Care to in-form"
"my self of the Particu-lars"
"in which its Strength consists. And"
"these I find are chiefly owing to its vantagious"
"Situation; for it has neither"
"Rocks nor Fortifications near it, and yet"
"is, perhaps, the most impregnable Town"
"in Europe. It stands at least Four Miles"
"from any part of the Terra Firma, nor are"
"the Shallows that lye about it, ever"
"frozen hard enough to bring over an Ar-my"
"from the Land-side. The constant"
"Flux and Reflux of the Sea, or the na-tural"
"Mildness of the Climate, hindering"
"the Ice from gathering to any Thick-ness;"
"which is an Advantage the Hol-landers"
"want, when they have laid all"
"their Country under Water. On the"
"Side that is exposed to the Adriatic, the"
"Entrance is so difficult to hit, that they"
"have marked it out with several Stakes"
"driven into the Ground, which they"
"would not fail to cut upon the first ap-proach"
"of an Enemy Fleet. For this"
"Reason they have not fortified the little"
"Islands, that lye at the Entrance, to the"
"best Advantage, which might otherwise"
"very easily command all the Passes that"
"lead to the City from the Adriatic. Nor"
"could an ordinary Fleet, with Bomb-Ves-sels,"
"hope to succeed against a Place that"
"has always in its Arsenal a considerable"
"Number of Gallies and Men of War rea-dy"
"to put to Sea on a very short warning."
"If we could therefore suppose them block-ed"
"up on all sides, by a Power too strong for"
"them, both by Sea and Land, they would"
"be able to defend themselves against every"
"thing but Famine; and this would not"
"be a little mitigated by the great Quan-tities"
"of Fish that their Seas abound with,"
"and that may be taken up in the midst"
"of their very Streets, which is such a"
"natural Magazine as few other Places"
"can boast of."
"            Our Voyage-Writers will needs have"
"this City in great Danger of being left,"
"within an Age or two, on the Terra"
"Firma; and represent it in such a man-ner,"
"as if the Sea was insensibly shrink-ing"
"from it, and retiring into its Chan-nel."
"I asked several, and among the rest"
"Father Coronelli, the State Geographer,"
"of the Truth of this Particular, and they"
"all assured me that the Sea rises as high"
"as ever, though  the great Heaps of Dirt"
"it brings along with it are apt to"
"choak up the Shallows, but that they"
"are in no Danger of losing the Benefit"
"of their Situation, so long as they are at"
"the Charge of removing these Banks of"
"Mud and Sand. One may see abun-dance"
"of them above the Surface of the"
"Water, scattered up and down like so"
"many little Islands, when the Tide is"
"low; and they are these that make the"
"Entrance for Ships difficult to such as"
"are not used to them, for the deep Ca-nals"
"run between them, which the Ve-netians"
"are at a great Expence to keep"
"free and open."
"            This City stands very convenient for"
"Commerce. It has several Navigable"
"Rivers that run up into the Body of I-taly,"
"by which they might supply a great"
"many Countries with Fish and other"
"Commodities; not to mention their Op-portunities"
"for the Levant, and each side"
"of the Adriatic. But, notwithstanding"
"these Conveniencies, their Trade is far"
"from being in a flourishing Condition for"
"many Reasons. The Duties are great that"
"are laid on Merchandises. Their Nobles"
"think it below their Quality to engage"
"in Traffick. The Merchants who are"
"grown Rich, and able to manage great"
"Dealings, buy their Nobility, and ge-nerally"
"give over Trade. Their Manu-factures"
"of Cloth, Glass and Silk, for-merly"
"the best in Europe, are now ex-celled"
"by those of other Countries. They"
"are tenacious of old Laws and Customs"
"to their great Prejudice, whereas a Tra-ding"
"Nation must be still for new Chan-ges"
"and Expedients, as different Jun-ctures"
"and Emergencies arise. The State"
"is at present very sensible of this Decay"
"in their Trade, and as a Noble Venetian,"
"who is still a Merchant, told me, they"
"will speedily find out some Method to"
"redress it; possibly by making a free"
"Port, for they look with an Evil Eye"
"upon Leghorne, which draws to it most of"
"the Vessels bound for Italy. They have"
"hitherto been so negligent in this Parti-cular,"
"that many think the Great Duke's"
"Gold has had no small Influence in their"
"Councils."
"            "
"               Venice has several Particulars which"
"are not to be found in other Cities, and"
"is therefore very entertaining to a Tra-veller."
"It looks, at a distance, like a great"
"Town half floated by a Deluge. There"
"are Canals every where crossing it, so"
"that one may go to most Houses either"
"by Land or Water. This is a very great"
"Convenience to the Inhabitants; for a"
"Gondola with Two Oars at Venice, is as"
"magnificent as a Coach and Six Horses,"
"with a large Equipage, in another Coun-try;"
"besides that it makes all Carriages"
"extreamly cheap. The Streets are gene-rally"
"Paved with Brick or Free-stone,"
"and always kept very neat, for there is"
"no Carriage, not so much as a Chair,"
"that passes through  them. There is an in-numerable"
"Multitude of very handsome"
"Bridges, all of a single Arch, and with-out"
"any Fence on either side, which"
"would be a great Inconvenience to a"
"City less sober than Venice. One would"
"indeed wonder that Drinking is so little"
"in Vogue among the Venetians, who are"
"in a moist Air and a moderate Climate,"
"and have no such Diversions as Bowling,"
"Hunting, Walking, Riding, and the"
"like Exercises to employ them without"
"Doors. But as the Nobles are not to"
"Converse too much with Strangers, they"
"are in no Danger of learning it; and"
"they are generally too distrustful of one"
"another for the Freedoms that are used"
"in such kind of Conversations. There"
"are many Noble Palaces in Venice. Their"
"Furniture is not commonly very Rich,"
"if we except the Pictures, which are"
"here in greater plenty than in any other"
"Place in Europe, from the Hands of the"
"best Masters of the Lombard School; as"
"Titian, Paul Veronese and Tintoret. The"
"last of these is in greater Esteem at Ve-nice"
"than in other Parts of Italy. The"
"Rooms are generally hung with Gilt"
"Leather, which they cover on extraor-dinary"
"Occasions with Tapestry, and"
"Hangings of greater Value. The Floor-ing"
"is a kind of Red Plaister made of"
"Brick ground to Powder, and afterwards"
"worked into Mortar. It is rubbed with"
"Oil, and makes a smooth, shining and"
"beautiful Surface. These Particularities"
"are chiefly owing to the Moisture of the"
"Air, which would have an ill Effect on"
"other kinds of Furniture, as it shows it"
"'self too visibly in many of their finest"
"Pictures. though  the Venetians are ex-treamly"
"jealous of any great Fame or"
"Merit in a living Member of their Com-mon-wealth,"
"they never fail of giving a"
"Man his due Parises, when they are in"
"no Danger of suffering from his Ambi "
"For this Reason, though  there are a"
"great many Monuments erected to such"
"as have been Benefactors to the Repub-lick,"
"they are generally put up after their"
"Deaths. Among the many Elogiums"
"that are given to the Doge Pisauro, who"
"had been Ambassador in England, his pitaph"
"'says, In Angliâ Jacobi Regis obi-tum"
"mirâ calliditate celatum mirâ sagacita-te"
"rimatus priscam benevolentiam firmavit."
"The particular Palaces, Churches, and"
"Pictures of Venice, are enumerated in se-veral"
"little Books that may be bought on"
"the Place, and have been faithfully"
"Transcribed by many Voyage-Writers."
"When I was at Venice, they were putting"
"out very curious Stamps of the several"
"Edifices which are most famous for their"
"Beauty or Magnificence. The Arsenal"
"of Venice is an Island of about three Miles"
"round. It contains all the Stores and"
"Provisions for War, that are not actu-ally"
"employed. There are Docks for"
"their Gallies and Men of War, most of"
"them full, as well as Work-Houses for"
"all Land and Naval Preparations. That"
"Part of it, where the Arms are laid,"
"makes a great show, and was indeed very"
"extraordinary about a Hundred Years"
"ago, but at present a great part of its"
"Furniture is grown useless. There seem"
"to be almost as many Suits of Armour as"
"there are Guns. The Swords are old-fashioned"
"and unwieldy in a very great"
"Number, and the Fire-Arms fitted with"
"Locks of little Convenience in compa-rison"
"of those that are now in use. The"
"               Venetians pretend they could set out, in"
"Case of great Necessity, Thirty Men of"
"War, a Hundred Gallies, and Ten Ga-leasses,"
"tho' I cannot conceive how they"
"could Man a Fleet of half the number."
"It was certainly a mighty Error in this"
"State to affect so many Conquests on the"
"Terra Firma, which has only served to"
"raise the Jealousie of the Christian Prin-ces,"
"and about Three Hundred Years"
"ago had like to have ended in the utter"
"Extirpation of the Common-wealth;"
"whereas, had they applyed themselves"
"with the same Politics and Industry to"
"the Increase of their Strength by Sea,"
"they might perhaps have had all the"
"Islands of the Archipelago in their Hands,"
"and, by Consequence, the greatest Fleet,"
"and the most Sea-men of any other State"
"in Europe. Besides, that this would have"
"given no Jealousie to the Princes their"
"Neighbours, who would have enjoyed"
"their own Dominions in Peace, and"
"have been very well contented to have"
"'seen so strong a Bulwark against all the"
"Forces and Invasions of the Ottoman Em-pire."
"            This Republick has been much more"
"powerful than it is at present, as it is still"
"likelier to sink than increase in its Domini-ons."
"It is not impossible but the Spaniard"
"               "
"There is scarce any Part"
"of the Nation that is not Famous"
"in History, nor so much as a Moun-tain"
"or River that has not been the"
"Scene of some extraordinary Action."
"            As there are few Men that have"
"Talents or Opportunities for exa-mining"
"'so copious a Subject, one"
"may observe among those who have"
"written on Italy, that different Au-thors"
"have succeeded best on diffe-rent"
"'sorts of Curiosities. Some have"
"been more particular in their Ac-counts"
"of Pictures, Statues and"
"Buildings; some have searched in-to"
"Libraries, Cabinets of Rarities,"
"and Collections of Medals, as others"
"have been wholly taken up with In-scriptions,"
"Ruins and Antiquities."
"Among the Authors of our own Coun-try,"
"we are obliged to the Bishop of"
"Salisbury, for his masterly and uncom-mon"
"Observations on the Religion and"
"Governments of Italy: Lassels may"
"be useful in giving us the Names of"
"'such Writers as have treated of the"
"'several States through which he"
"may, some time or other, demand of them"
"Creme, Brescia, and Bergame, which have"
"been torn from the Milanese; and in case"
"a War should arise upon it, and the Ve-netians"
"lose a single Battel, they might"
"be beaten off the Continent in a single"
"Summer, for their Fortifications are ve-ry"
"Inconsiderable. On the other side,"
"the Venetians are in continual Apprehen-sions"
"from the Turk, who will certainly"
"endeavour at the Recovery of the Mo-rea,"
"as soon as the Ottoman Empire has"
"recruited a little of its ancient Strength."
"They are very sensible that they had"
"better have pushed their Conquests on"
"the other side of the Adriatick into Al-bania,"
"for then their Territories would"
"have lain together, and have been nearer"
"the Fourtain-Head to have received Suc-cours"
"on occasions; but the Venetians are"
"under Articles with the Emperor, to re-sign"
"into his Hands whatever they con-quer"
"of the Turkish Dominions, that has"
"been formerly dismembered from the"
"Empire. And having already very much"
"dissatisfied him in the Frioul and Dalma-tia,"
"they dare not think of exasperating"
"him further. The Pope disputes with"
"them their Pretensions to the Polesin, as"
"the Duke of Savoy lays an equal Claim"
"to the Kingdom of Cyprus.  it is surpri-sing"
"to consider with what Heats these"
"Two Powers have contested their Title"
"to a Kingdom that is in the Hands of"
"the Turk."
"            "
"            Among all these Difficulties the Re-publick"
"will still maintain it self, if Po-licy"
"can prevail upon Force; for it is"
"certain the Venetian Senate is one of"
"the wisest Councils in the World, though "
"at the same time, if we believe the Re-ports"
"of several that have been well"
"versed in their Constitution, a great part"
"of their Politics is founded on Maxims"
"which others do not think consistent with"
"their Honour to put in practice. The"
"Preservation of the Republick is that to"
"which all other Considerations submit."
"To encourage Idleness and Luxury in"
"the Nobility, to cherish Ignorance and"
"Licentiousness in the Clergy, to keep"
"alive a continual Faction in the Common"
"People, to connive at the Viciousness"
"and Debauchery of Convents, to breed"
"Dissensions among the Nobles of the"
"Terra Firma, to treat a brave Man with"
"Scorn and Infamy: In short, to stick at"
"nothing for the Publick Interest, are re-presented"
"as the refined Parts of the Ve-netian"
"Wisdom."
"            Among all the Instances of their Po-litics,"
"there is none more admirable than"
"the great Secrecy that reigns in their"
"Public Councils. The Senate is gene-rally"
"as numerous as our House of Com-mons,"
"if we only reckon the sitting"
"Members, and yet carries its Resoluti-ons"
"'so privately, that they are seldom"
"known 'till they discover themselves in"
"the Execution. It is not many Years"
"'since they had before them a great bate"
"concerning the Punishment of one"
"of their Admirals, which lasted a Month"
"together, and concluded in his Condem-nation;"
"yet was there none of his Friends,"
"nor of those who had engaged warmly"
"in his Defence, that gave him the least"
"Intimation of what was passing against"
"him, 'till he was actually seized, and in"
"the Hands of Justice."
"            The Noble Venetians think themselves"
"equal at least to the Electors of the Em-pire,"
"and but one Degree below Kings;"
"for which reason they seldom travel in-to"
"Foreign Countries, where they must"
"undergo the Mortification of being treat-ed"
"like private Gentlemen: Yet it is ob-served"
"of them, that they discharge them-selves"
"with a great deal of Dexterity in"
"'such Embassies and Treaties as are laid"
"on them by the Republick; for their"
"whole Lives are employed in Intrigues"
"of State, and they naturally give them-selves"
"Airs of Kings and Princes, of"
"which the Ministers of other Nations"
"are only the Representatives. Monsieur"
"Amelot reckons in his Time, Two Thou-sand"
"Five Hundred Nobles that had"
"Voices in the great Council, but at pre-sent,"
"I am told, there are not at most"
"Fifteen Hundred, notwithstanding the"
"Addition of many new Families since"
"that time. It is very strange, that with"
"this Advantage they are not able to keep"
"up their Number, considering that the"
"Nobility spreads equally through  all the"
"Brothers, and that so very few of them"
"are destroyed by the Wars of the Re-publick."
"Whether this may be imputed"
"to the Luxury of the Venetians, or to"
"the ordinary Celibacy of the younger Bro-thers,"
"or to the last Plague which swept"
"away many of them, I know not. They"
"generally thrust the Females of their Fa-milies"
"into Convents, the better to pre-serve"
"their Estates. This makes the Ve-netian"
"Nuns famous for the Liberties they"
"allow themselves. They have Opera's"
"within their own Walls, and often go"
"out of their Bounds to meet their mirers,"
"or they are very much misrepre-sented."
"They have many of them their"
"Lovers, that converse with them daily at"
"the Grate, and are very free to admit a"
"Visit from a Stranger. There is indeed"
"one of the Cornara  that not long ago"
"refused to see any under a Prince."
"            The Carnaval of Venice is every where"
"talked of. The great Diversion of the place"
"at that Time, as well as on all other high"
"Occasions, is Masking. The Venetians,"
"who are naturally Grave, love to give into"
"the Follies and Entertainments of such Sea-sons,"
"when disguised in a false Personage."
"They are indeed under a necessity of"
"finding out Diversions that may agree"
"with the Nature of the Place, and make"
"'some Amends for the Loss of several Plea-sures"
"which may be met with on the Con-tinent."
"These Disguises give Occasion"
"to abundance of Love Adventures; for"
"there is something more intriguing in the"
"Amours of Venice, than in those of other"
"Countries, and I question not but the"
"Secret History of a Carnaval would make"
"a Collection of very diverting Novels."
"Opera are another great Entertain-ment"
"of this Season. The Poetry of them"
"is generally as exquisitely ill, as the"
"Musick is good. The Arguments are"
"often taken from some celebrated Action"
"of the ancient Greeks or Romans, which"
"'sometimes looks ridiculous enough; for"
"who can endure to hear one of the rough"
"old Romans squeaking through  the Mouth"
"of an Eunuch, especially when they may"
"chuse a Subject out of Courts where Eu-nuchs"
"are really Actors, or represent by"
"them any of the soft Asiatic Monarchs?"
"The Opera that was most in Vogue,"
"during my Stay at Venice, was built on"
"the following Subject. Caesar and Scipio"
"are Rivals for Cato Daughter. Cae-sar's"
"first Words bid his Soldiers fly, for"
"the Enemies are upon them. Si Leva"
"Cesare, dice a Soldati. A fugga. A'"
"lo Scampo. The Daughter gives the Pre-ference"
"to Caesar, which is made the"
"Occasion of Cato Death. Before he"
"kills himself, you see him withdrawn in-to"
"his Library, where, among his Books,"
"I observed the Titles of Plutarch and"
"Tasso. After a short Soliloquy he strikes"
"himself with the Dagger that he holds"
"in his Hand, but, being interrupted by"
"one of his Friends, he stabs him for his"
"Pains, and by the Violence of the Blow"
"unluckily breaks the Dagger on one of"
"his Ribs, so that he is forced to dispatch"
"himself by tearing up his first Wound."
"This last Circumstance puts me in Mind"
"of a Contrivance in the Opera of St. An-gelo,"
"that was acted at the same time."
"The King of the Play endeavours at a"
"Rape, but the Poet being resolved to"
"'save his Heroine Honour, has so or-dered"
"it, that the King always acts with"
"a great Case-Knife stuck in his Girdle,"
"which the Lady snatches from him in"
"the Struggle, and so defends her self."
"            The Italian Poets, besides the cele-brated"
"Smoothness of their Tongue, have"
"a particular Advantage, above the Wri-ters"
"of other Nations, in the difference"
"of their Poetical and Prose Language."
"There are indeed Sets of Phrases that in"
"all Countries are peculiar to the Poets,"
"but among the Italians there are not only"
"Sentences, but a Multitude of particu-lar"
"Words that never enter into common"
"Discourse. They have such a different"
"Turn and Polishing for Poetical Use, that"
"they drop several of their Letters, and"
"appear in another Form, when they"
"come to be ranged in Verse. For this"
"Reason the Italian Opera seldom sinks"
"into a Poorness of Language, but, a-midst"
"all the Meanness and Familiarity"
"of the Thoughts, has something beau-tiful"
"and sonorous in the Expression."
"Without this natural Advantage of the"
"Tongue, their present Poetry would"
"appear wretchedly low and vulgar, not-withstanding"
"the many strained Allego-ries"
"that are so much in use among the"
"Writers of this Nation. The English"
"               "
"and French, who always use the same"
"Words in Verse as in ordinary Conver-sation,"
"are forced to raise their Language"
"with Metaphors and Figures, or, by"
"the Pompousness of the whole Phrase,"
"to wear off any Littleness that appears"
"in the particular Parts that compose it."
"This makes our Blank Verse, where"
"there is no Rhime to support the Ex-pression,"
"extreamly difficult to such as"
"are not Masters in the Tongue, especi-ally"
"when they write on low Subjects;"
"and  it is probably for this Reason that"
"Milton has made use of such frequent"
"Transpositions, Latinisms, antiquated"
"Words and Phrases, that he might the"
"better deviate from vulgar and ordinary"
"Expressions."
"            The Comedies that I saw at Venice,"
"or indeed in any other Part of Italy, are"
"very indifferent, and more lewd than"
"those of other Countries. Their Poets"
"have no Notion of gentile Comedy, and"
"fall into the most filthy double Mean-ings"
"imaginable, when they have a Mind"
"to make their Audience merry. There"
"is no Part generally so wretched as that"
"of the fine Gentleman, especially when"
"he Converses with his Mistress; for then"
"the whole Dialogue is an insipid mix-ture"
"of Pedantry and Romance. But"
" it is no wonder that the Poets of so Jea-lous"
"and Reserved a Nation fail in such"
"Conversations on the Stage, as they have"
"no Patterns of in Nature. There are"
"Four Standing Characters which enter"
"into every Piece that comes on the Stage,"
"the Doctor, Harlequin, Pantalone and Co-viello."
"The Doctor Character com-prehends"
"the whole Extent of a Pedant,"
"that with a deep Voice, and a Magi-sterial"
"Air breaks in upon Conversation,"
"and drives down all before him: Every"
"thing he says is backed with Quotati-ons"
"out of Galen, Hippocrates, Plato, Vir-gil,"
"or any Author that rises uppermost,"
"aad all Answers from his Companion are"
"looked upon as Impertinencies or Inter-ruptions."
"Harlequin Part is made up"
"of Blunders and Absurdities: He is to"
"mistake one Name for another, to for-get"
"his Errands, to stumble over Queens,"
"and to run his Head against every Post"
"that stands in his way. This is all at-tended"
"with something so Comical in"
"the Voice and Gestures, that a Man,"
"who is sensible of the Folly of the Part,"
"can hardly forbear being pleased with it."
"Pantalone is generally an old Cully, and"
"Coviello a Sharper."
"            I have seen a Translation of the Cid"
"acted at Bolonia, which would never"
"have taken, had they not found a Place"
"in it for these Buffoons. All Four of"
"them appear in Masks that are made"
"like the old Roman Personae, as I shall"
"have occasion to observe in another"
"Place. The French and Italians have"
"probably derived this Custom of shew-ing"
"'some of their Characters in Masks,"
"from the Greek and Roman Theater. The"
"old Vatican Terence has at the Head of"
"every Scene the Figures of all the Per-sons"
"that are concerned in it, with the"
"particular Disguises in which they acted;"
"and I remember to have seen in the Vil-la"
"Mattheio an Antick Statue masked,"
"which was perhaps designed for Gnatho"
"in the Eunuch, for it agrees exactly"
"with the Figure he makes in the Vati-can"
"Manuscript. One would wonder"
"indeed how so Polite a People, as the"
"ancient Romans and Athenians, should"
"not look on these borrowed Faces as un-natural."
"They might do very well for"
"a Cyclops, or a Satyr, that can have no"
"Resemblance in Human Features; but"
"for a Flatterer, a Miser, or the like Cha-racters,"
"which abound in our own Spe-cies,"
"nothing is more ridiculous than to"
"represent their Looks by a painted zard."
"In Persons of this Nature the"
"Turns and Motions of the Face are of-ten"
